"“I think I’m all set here,” he says, and lol of course he isn’t going","to kiss me. “But if I forgot anything, you can have Jake come pick it up.”",31,"to admit it, but I can tell by the way he's fidgeting with his backpack straps that he's still got a few things on his mind. He looks around the small apartment, taking in the familiar sights of the worn couch and the faded poster on the wall, and for a moment I think I see a flicker of uncertainty in his eyes. But then his face sets in a determined expression, and he gives me a nod. ""Yeah, I'm good,"" he says again, this time with a bit more conviction. I raise an eyebrow, but I don't push the issue. We've been over this a million times already, and I know he's made up his mind. Still, I can't help but feel a twinge of worry as I watch him sling his backpack over his shoulder and head for the door."
"Jake: younger brother to West (and only slightly less good-looking) and that type of college friend who knows everything about my life at UCLA but has never met my father, who lives only an hour away.","Jake introduced me to West; now Jake will be my sole remaining connection to West. The thought makes me a little sad, but then I remember I have the couch and T-virus zombies waiting for me inside.",73,"He's the kind of friend who knows my favorite coffee order, my go-to karaoke song, and the intricacies of my on-again, off-again relationship with Rachel, but has never set foot in my childhood home or met the man who taught me how to ride a bike and throw a baseball. It's a strange dynamic, but one that I've grown accustomed to over the years. Despite the distance between our families, Jake and I have formed a bond that transcends geographical boundaries, one that is rooted in late-night conversations, silly jokes, and a deep affection for each other's company. As we sit on the couch, swapping stories and sharing laughs, I'm reminded of the countless memories we've created together, and I'm grateful for the presence of this pseudo-brother in my life."
"“You, too.” West smiles that eye-crinkling smile again, and","damn, I really wish I’d seen it more. “Bye, Anna.”",19,"he leans in, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone as he says, ""I think we're going to get along just fine, you and I."" His words are laced with a hint of mischief, and I find myself wondering what exactly he has in mind, but before I can ask, he's already turning to lead me out of the room, his long strides forcing me to hurry to keep up with him."
"I feel her attention move from the empty apartment to the side of my face, and when I smile","over at her, her blue eyes are round with worry. “Holy shit, Anna, I had no idea. Are you okay?”",39,"she smiles back, and for a moment, the emptiness of the apartment is filled with the warmth of our shared amusement. Her eyes sparkle with curiosity, and I can sense her wondering what I'm thinking, what I'm feeling in this moment. I take a deep breath, and my gaze drifts back to the empty space, my mind wandering to the memories we've yet to create within these walls. The silence between us is comfortable, a testament to the ease with which we've settled into each other's presence. As I turn back to her, I notice the way the fading light dances across her features, casting a soft glow on her skin, and I feel my heart swell with affection. The apartment may be empty, but with her by my side, it feels full of possibility."
"“That is wonderful news, sweetheart! Oh, I’m so thrilled! Why don’t you fly down to John Wayne the night","before, stay at the house, and we’ll all take the plane over together? The flight to Singapore is a bear.”",39,"before your birthday and we can celebrate together. I'll pick you up from the airport and we can head straight to the beach house. We can spend the weekend relaxing and catching up. I've missed you so much, and I just can't wait to see you and give you a big hug. We'll have to plan a special birthday dinner at that new restaurant you've been wanting to try. And of course, we'll have to make some time for shopping and maybe even a spa day. I just know it's going to be the best birthday ever! I love you, sweetie, and I'm so proud of you. You deserve all the happiness in the world."
"“Anna?” he says, like he’s not entirely sure, and then does a full top-to-bottom sweep of my body, which recalls the lack of pants.","When he digs his hand into his luscious head of hair, I forget to be embarrassed again, because it all comes back to me.",48,"His eyes widen slightly as he takes in my bare legs, and for a moment, we just stare at each other, the air thick with unspoken thoughts. I can feel my face heat up, and I'm torn between covering myself and standing my ground. He clears his throat, breaking the spell, and takes a step back, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape or a distraction. ""I, uh, I didn't mean to intrude,"" he says, his voice low and rough, and I can tell he's trying to sound casual, but his eyes keep drifting back to me. I take a deep breath and try to play it cool, but my heart is racing, and I can feel my pulse pounding in my veins. ""It's okay,"" I say, trying to sound nonchalant, ""I was just... um... getting ready for bed."" I gesture vaguely towards the bed, hoping he'll buy it, but he raises an eyebrow, clearly skeptical."
The expression he makes is like the meme of that one kid who smiles and then immediately bursts into tears.,West is staring at me like he’s doomed but must pretend to be happy about it. “Anna. You look… great?”,40,"His face contorts in a mix of emotions, as if he's trying to hold back laughter, but his eyes betray him, welling up with tears that threaten to spill over at any moment, making everyone around him feel a pang of awkwardness and sympathy."
"Stepping aside, I let him pass, and he pulls up short at what’s on the television screen. Conan is",enthusiastically fucking a witch in a cave. We both clear our throats and look up at the ceiling instead.,38,"on, and the show is in the middle of a heated debate about the latest celebrity scandal. The guest, a well-known actress, is defending her recent actions, and the audience is divided in their opinions. My roommate's eyes are glued to the screen, and he's completely absorbed in the drama unfolding before him. I take the opportunity to grab a snack from the kitchen, trying not to disturb him as he watches the show with rapt attention. As I munch on a handful of chips, I can hear the actress's voice rising in indignation, and the audience's murmurs of agreement or disagreement. It's clear that this is a topic that's got everyone talking, and my roommate is no exception. He's always been a fan of celebrity gossip, and I'm not surprised to see him so engrossed in the show. I shake my head good-naturedly, smiling to myself as I head back to my room to let him have his moment of guilty pleasure."
"He adjusts his posture on the sofa, turning slightly to face me. Oh, right. He came here to","ask me for help. I sit up, too, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. Focus, Anna.",37,"talk to me about something, I remember now. His eyes lock onto mine, and I can sense a mix of emotions swirling beneath the surface. He takes a deep breath, and I can tell he's choosing his words carefully, trying to find the right way to express whatever it is that's been weighing on his mind. The air in the room seems to thicken, heavy with anticipation, as I wait for him to begin. His voice is low and measured when he finally speaks, and I lean forward, my heart beating just a little bit faster, as I prepare to listen to what he has to say."
"“I knew what Jake ordered for lunch and what kinds of stupid movies would make him laugh, and I could predict all his pickup lines","at parties, but we didn’t ever, like, sit down and do backstory. He didn’t even mention he had a brother until he suggested I marry you.”",51,"by heart. But I had no idea what he was thinking when he stared out the window, his eyes squinting against the sun, his jaw clenched in a way that made me want to reach out and smooth the tension away. I didn't know what he dreamed about at night, or what his biggest fears were, or what he wanted to be when he grew up. And I certainly didn't know what he was thinking when he looked at me, his eyes locking onto mine with an intensity that made my heart skip a beat. I thought I knew Jake, but the more I looked at him, the more I realized how little I actually knew. And that realization was both exhilarating and terrifying."
"“I definitely need to go back to the beginning,” I say, wiping my eyes. I mime an explosion at my temples. “Like—my mind is blown right now. You dressed like a middle schooler around the house. All basketball shorts, all the time. You drove a Honda! West, you’re incognito rich!","No wonder Jake never told me anything about his family! I would have made him pay for Jersey Mike’s every fucking time! Wait. Why did you need to live on campus? If you’re the grandson of the founder of Weston’s, you could probably buy an entire apartment building on Sunset.”",100,"I stare at him, trying to reconcile the image of the laid-back, casual guy I thought I knew with the reality of his wealth. West chuckles and shrugs, seeming to enjoy my shock. ""I like to keep a low profile,"" he says with a grin. ""I don't need everyone knowing my business. Plus, it's just more comfortable this way."" I shake my head, still trying to wrap my mind around this new information. ""I had no idea,"" I repeat, feeling a little silly for not picking up on the clues sooner. West laughs and takes a step closer to me. ""That's what I like about you,"" he says, his voice low and smooth. ""You don't care about any of that stuff. You like me for who I am, not for my bank account."" I look up at him, feeling a flutter in my chest. Is that really true? Do I like him for who he is, or am I just caught up in the excitement of it all? I push the thought aside, not wanting to ruin the moment. ""So, what's the plan now?"" I ask, trying to sound casual. West smiles and holds out his hand. ""Now, we go on a real date. No more hiding, no more secrets. Just us, out in the open."" I take his hand, feeling a spark of electricity as our palms touch. I have a feeling that this is just the beginning of a wild ride."
"That lands in a puddle of silence, and it hits me after a couple of seconds filled only",with the sound of Conan kicking someone’s ass on TV that West expects me to catch his meaning.,36,"with the sound of raindrops hitting the pavement, that I've been standing here for what feels like an eternity, frozen in a moment that refuses to move forward. The world around me seems to be holding its breath, waiting for something to shatter the stillness, but I'm not sure what that something is or when it will come. The silence is oppressive, a heavy blanket that's suffocating me, making it hard to breathe. I try to take a step forward, but my feet feel rooted to the spot, unable to move, unable to escape the weight of this moment. And then, just as suddenly as it started, the silence is broken by the sound of a car driving by, its tires splashing through the puddles on the road, and the world comes back to life, leaving me feeling shaken and disoriented."
“Correct.” He looks down to his lap. “Only Jake knew the real situation. The rest of my family was disappointed that,"I didn’t let them throw me a big wedding, but I guess they weren’t all that surprised. I’ve always been private.”",42,"they couldn't understand why I had to leave so suddenly. My mom kept asking me if everything was okay, but I just shook my head and told her I needed some time to think. My dad, on the other hand, was furious. He thought I was being irresponsible and that I was throwing away my future. My siblings just looked at me with confusion and concern, not knowing what to make of the situation. But Jake, he just nodded and said he understood. He was the only one who knew the truth, and I was grateful to have him by my side. I remember the look on his face, a mix of sadness and determination, as he promised to help me through this difficult time. Little did I know, that was only the beginning of a long and challenging journey."
"He looks me over again, top to bottom, and the defeat in his eyes makes me realize the true extent of my unshowered, feral chaos. “Actually,","Anna,” he says, “I need you to come with me to my sister’s wedding in Indonesia and convincingly play the part of my very loving wife.”",52,"“I think I'll just take your word for it,” he says, a small, wry smile playing on his lips. He steps back, his eyes never leaving mine, and I feel a strange sense of disappointment wash over me. I'm not sure what I was expecting - for him to magically see past the grime and the tangles and the general air of dishevelment, maybe, and declare me a radiant beauty beneath? - but it wasn't this. This feeling of being seen, truly seen, and found wanting. He turns to leave, and I feel a pang of panic. “Wait,” I say, my voice barely above a whisper. He turns back, his eyebrows raised in inquiry. “Can I...can I ask you something?” I take a deep breath, the words tumbling out in a rush. “How did you end up here? I mean, in this place, at this time? You don't exactly...blend in.” He raises an eyebrow, a hint of amusement dancing in his eyes. “And you do?” he asks, his voice low and smooth. I feel a flush rise to my cheeks, but I press on. “I mean, you're...you're not like the others. You're not...broken.” His expression changes, the amusement fading into something else. Something almost like sadness. “I'm not unbroken, either,” he says, his voice barely above a whisper. “I'm just...different. And I think, maybe, that's what you are too.”"
"It’s surreal to be here with her after all this time. I was so close to being done with this, so near to the finish line, yet here I am, having to improvise an intricate plan B at the eleventh hour with a Muppet in human form as my co-conspirator. Don’t get me wrong, beneath the baked, unshowered disarray, Anna is still a beautiful woman, with enormous brown eyes, creamy skin, and long, willowy limbs. I’d always been fascinated with the perfect beauty mark just above her lip. Unfortunately, right now she looks like","she’s fallen out of a tree and crawled through a field of tangly briers to get back to her apartment. This is probably the closest I’ve ever seen to her natural hair color because the pink has grown out a good inch, leaving a stripe of brown at her roots. Her makeup is, I presume, from yesterday; shadows of mascara carve dark circles beneath her eyes. Despite the old makeup and frazzled appearance, there’s still something striking about her. Her eyes are enormous and bright, framed with dark lashes, her steady gaze entirely without artifice.",189,"she just rolled out of a dumpster. Her hair is a tangled mess, and her clothes are stained and reek of last night's Chinese takeout. I can only imagine the state of her breath. I try not to think about it as I glance over at her, taking in the determined look on her face. We're sitting in a cramped, dingy motel room on the outskirts of town, the kind of place where the carpet sticks to your feet and the air conditioning unit sounds like a dying animal. It's not exactly the Ritz, but it's the best we could do on short notice. Anna's eyes are fixed intently on the map spread out before us, her brow furrowed in concentration. I can almost see the wheels turning in her head as she tries to come up with a plan. I have to admit, despite her current state, she's still got a spark in her eyes that I find captivating. It's a spark that I'm not sure I'm ready to deal with, but I don't have a choice. We're in this together now, for better or for worse. I take a deep breath and try to focus on the task at hand, pushing aside the memories that threaten to surface. We have a job to do, and I need to keep my head in the game if we're going to make it out of this alive. ""Okay, so we need to get to the warehouse by midnight,"" Anna says, her voice low and husky. ""We'll need to take the back roads to avoid the traffic cameras."" I nod, my eyes scanning the map as I try to commit the route to memory. It's going to be a long night."
"Though I am nearly certain her mind has wandered to something other than the topic at hand, I let her stare at the wall",a little longer so I can stare at her and reconcile this version of Anna with the one I lived with for two years.,48,"for a moment, her eyes glazing over as if lost in thought. I've grown accustomed to these brief lapses in attention, and I know that with a gentle nudge, she'll refocus. I clear my throat, and her gaze slowly drifts back to me, a hint of apology flickering across her face. ""Sorry,"" she says softly, ""I was just thinking about..."" Her voice trails off, and I sense a mixture of emotions swirling beneath the surface. I lean forward, my curiosity piqued, and encourage her to continue, ""About what?"" I ask, my tone gentle and non-judgmental. The room falls silent, the only sound the soft hum of the air conditioner in the background, as she hesitates, collecting her thoughts before responding."
"As roommates, we didn’t know each other well—that much is probably obvious—but there is an intimacy to sharing a space with someone, a certain kind of kinship that comes with daily proximity. Anna was reasonably tidy and paid her half of the rent when it was due, but she’d never struck me as the organized, driven, premed type. The one time we talked about it, she","said something about medicine being the most palatable of the “real job” options, but she seemed overwhelmed a lot, studying late into the night and painting to decompress in what little free time she had. That she ultimately switched her major to fine art makes a certain amount of sense, but I want to punch myself for not realizing she wasn’t studying medicine at all anymore.",132,"had mentioned something about wanting to be a doctor because her parents were doctors, and I'd assumed it was just a way of meeting their expectations. But as I stood there, staring at the neat rows of textbooks and the color-coded notes, I realized that I'd underestimated her. She was driven, all right – driven to succeed, driven to please, driven to be perfect. And I couldn't help but wonder what had happened to that girl, the one who'd laughed and joked with me over coffee, the one who'd left her dirty socks on the floor and her hair clips on the counter. Where had she gone, and who was this person who'd taken her place? I felt a pang of guilt for not knowing her better, for not being a better friend. We'd lived together for two years, and yet I'd never really seen her. I'd seen the surface, the façade, but not the real Anna. And now, as I stood in her empty room, I couldn't help but wonder what else I'd missed."
"Anna squints at me. “You said ‘small,’ but I think you meant","‘private.’ Your sister is getting married on a private island, isn’t she?”",24,"‘medium’ or maybe even ‘large’ considering the size of the box you're holding. I try to gauge her expression, but her eyes are fixed intently on the object in my hands, her brow furrowed in a mixture of curiosity and concern. The air is thick with anticipation as she waits for my response, her voice hanging in the air like a challenge. I take a deep breath, weighing my options carefully, knowing that my next words could either alleviate or exacerbate the situation."
"“Yes.” I work to not let my gaze do another sweep of her apartment. I’ve never been to Pulau Jingga, but my mom has been sending me info that I’ve mostly ignored for months. I know the basic idea—a luxury resort and conservation area set in the Indonesian archipelago—and it’s about","as far from this dark, cramped living room as I can imagine. Right now, I need Anna to believe she can do this. Yes, she may be at rock bottom, but I need her to think she is just one fairy godmother moment away from sliding gracefully into the world she’s imagining.",103,"three hours from Singapore by ferry. But I have no idea what the actual experience is like. I imagine pristine beaches, crystal-clear waters, and a bunch of rich people trying to save the planet. I glance at my watch, realizing I've been standing here for a few minutes, and clear my throat to break the silence. ""So, what's the plan?"" I ask, trying to sound casual despite the growing unease in my stomach. She smiles, and for a moment, I think I see a glimmer of mischief in her eyes. ""We'll take a ferry to the island, and then a private boat will take us to the resort. We'll be there by tomorrow morning."" She pauses, studying me intently. ""But before we go, I need to brief you on a few things. It's not just a vacation, you know."" I raise an eyebrow, intrigued despite myself. ""What do you mean?"" I ask, my curiosity getting the better of me. She takes a deep breath, and I can sense a shift in her demeanor, a subtle change from relaxed to serious. ""Pulau Jingga is more than just a resort. It's a community, a group of people working together to protect the environment and preserve the local ecosystem. And we're not just guests, we're...participants."" I frown, unsure what to make of this. ""Participants?"" I repeat, feeling a sense of trepidation creeping up my spine. She nods, her eyes locked on mine. ""Yes. We'll be taking part in some of the conservation efforts, and I need to make sure you're prepared."" I swallow hard, my mind racing with questions. What kind of conservation efforts? What have I gotten myself into?"
"Anna looks down at herself and I follow her attention to the front of her shirt, where a Froot Loop adheres to the cotton over her left breast.",She plucks it off and pops it into her mouth. “Why not just find someone who can pretend to be me and who knows how to behave around societay?”,57,"She plucks it off, and it leaves a small ring of sticky residue that she tries to brush away, but it only smudges and spreads. I can tell she's trying not to laugh, but her eyes are sparkling with amusement. I chuckle and shake my head, feeling a warmth in my chest at the sight of her, Froot Loop and all. We stand there for a moment, grinning at each other, the tension between us dissipating. Then Anna's stomach growls loudly, and we both burst out laughing. ""I guess that's a sign we should get some real food,"" I say, and Anna nods enthusiastically. We head back to the kitchen, arm in arm, the Froot Loop incident already becoming a funny story we'll tell and retell for years to come."
“I have the one of you and Jake hiking the Hills in a frame in my living room. It,"looks enough like me from the back.” I pause, scratching my jaw. “And… I’ve had a few others digitally photoshopped.”",39,"reminds me of the good old days when life was simpler, and our biggest worry was what trail to take next. I often find myself smiling as I glance at the photo, remembering the laughter and the sense of adventure that filled the air. The way the sunlight danced through the trees, casting dappled shadows on the ground, and the sound of birds chirping in the distance – it's all still so vivid in my mind. I recall how Jake would always take the lead, his enthusiasm infectious, and you would follow closely behind, your eyes scanning the terrain with a mix of excitement and caution. Those were the days when time stood still, and all that mattered was the present moment, the beauty of nature, and the joy of sharing it with good friends."
"“That it’s small, upturned. She described it as ‘the nose Jenny Nelson",wanted and didn’t get.’ She’d notice if it was someone else’s nose.”,24,"would paint on a child’s face when she was drawing portraits of her classmates in elementary school.’ It was a nose that seemed to hold a perpetual smile, as if it was always sniffing out the next great adventure. Her eyes, a deep shade of brown that seemed to hold a world of wisdom, sparkled with a knowing glint, as if they held secrets that only she was privy to. The overall effect was one of whimsical charm, a face that seemed to belong to a mischievous sprite rather than a grown woman."
"I don’t love the implication that I don’t work, that I’m trying to breeze through life on my inheritance, but I understand why she sees it that way. The truth behind everything isn’t important right now, and if this goes the way I hope it","will, this will be an easy twelve days together and then we’ll never have to see each other again. “Anna, are you available to do this? Please. I will pay all your expenses. I will even give you some money if you need to buy clothes.”",91,"will, then I'll have the chance to prove her wrong. I'll be able to show her that I'm more than just a trust fund kid, that I have a passion and a drive that goes beyond my family's wealth. I'll be able to make a name for myself, to create something that's truly mine, and to prove to her and to myself that I'm capable of achieving great things. The thought of it is exhilarating, and I can feel a sense of determination rising up within me. I know it won't be easy, but I'm ready for the challenge. I'm ready to put in the hard work and dedication required to make my dreams a reality. I'm ready to show the world what I'm truly capable of, and I'm ready to make my family proud. I take a deep breath, feeling a sense of resolve wash over me, and I know that I'm ready to take the first step towards making my vision a reality."
"Anna points at me again. “Okay, I see that look, and so",let me ask: what manner of clothes are required on this trip?”,24,"does she know me that well already, I wonder, as she takes a step closer, her eyes sparkling with amusement and a hint of curiosity, her voice taking on a playful tone as she says, ""You're thinking about it, aren't you?"" and I feel a flush rise to my cheeks as I realize I've been caught, my mind racing with the possibilities of what she might be referring to, and before I can respond, she continues, ""Don't worry, I won't pry, but I have to say, I'm intrigued,"" and with that, she turns and walks away, leaving me to ponder the mystery of what just transpired."
"“No, no, no.” Anna sits up and runs her fingers under her eyes, clearing away much of the mascara there. She pulls her ponytail free and reties it. Both actions do wonders for how chaotic she looks.",“This is much more demanding. I’ll have to act. I’ll have to learn about everyone I’ll be meeting. I’ll have to manage your complete lack of humor. I’ll have to hobnob. This is an entirely new skill set.”,75,"As she stands up, she smooths out her dress, which had ridden up during her emotional outburst. She takes a few deep breaths, trying to calm herself down, and begins to pace around the room. Her eyes scan the space, taking in the familiar surroundings, but her mind is still reeling from the conversation she just had. She can't believe what was said, and the weight of it is crushing her. She feels like she's been punched in the gut, and she can't catch her breath. She stops pacing and looks around the room again, this time noticing the small details that she usually overlooks - the way the sunlight filters through the blinds, the dust particles dancing in the air, the faint scent of fresh laundry. She focuses on these tiny things, trying to ground herself in the present moment, to distract herself from the storm brewing inside her. But it's no use, her mind keeps wandering back to the conversation, replaying the words, the tone, the implications. She feels like she's losing control, like her world is spinning out of orbit, and she doesn't know how to stop it."
"“Babe, babe,” she says, cupping my cheeks. “There is",no downside here. Are you kidding? This is life-altering good.”,19,"something I need to tell you, something that might change everything between us, and I'm scared to say it out loud, but I have to, because keeping it inside is eating away at me, and I can see the concern in your eyes, the questions you're too afraid to ask, and I know I owe it to you, to us, to be honest, no matter how hard it is."
"“Insurance,” she says. “These people insure everything.” While I continue to stare at the rock, she returns to the list and laughs. “Get","this: ‘Anna, please feel free to schedule any hair, nails, spa, or grooming appointments and use the card to pay for those.’ ”",46," this one: 'In the event of a zombie apocalypse, the policyholder will be entitled to a full refund of all premiums paid, provided they can produce a certified zombie corpse.' I look up at her, incredulous. 'You're kidding me,' I say, but she just shrugs. 'I told you, they insure everything.' She hands me the list and I scan it, my eyes widening in amazement. 'Alien abduction, giant squid attack, spontaneous human combustion... what kind of people buy this stuff?' I ask, but she just laughs. 'The kind who want to be prepared for anything, I guess.' I shake my head, handing the list back to her. 'I think I need a drink.' She nods in agreement and we head back to the car, leaving the mysterious rock and its insurance policy behind."
There are two kinds of airport people: those who like to get to the,"airport three hours before departure to sit within eyesight of the gate, and Anna Green.",29,"airport with hours to spare, and those who like to arrive just as their flight is boarding. The former group is often filled with anxiety, constantly checking their watches and worrying that they'll miss their flight due to some unforeseen circumstance. They arrive at the airport with plenty of time to spare, and then proceed to spend that time pacing back and forth in front of the gate, or sitting in a crowded food court, sipping on an overpriced coffee. On the other hand, the latter group is often more relaxed, strolling into the airport with just enough time to drop off their bag and make their way to the gate. They're the ones who are always rushing to make their flight, but somehow always manage to make it just in time. Despite their differing approaches, both groups share one thing in common: a desire to get to their destination as quickly and efficiently as possible."
"My eyes go wide, meeting Anna’s just as she stumbles,","ankle twisting awkwardly on the skinny, murder-sharp heel of her shoe.",21,"her eyes flashing with a mix of fear and panic as she struggles to regain her balance, her hands grasping wildly for something, anything, to steady herself, but finding nothing but air, and for a moment, we just stare at each other, frozen in a silent understanding that something is terribly wrong."
"I can’t entirely refute this idea. I’ve been out of my parents’ circle long enough to understand how disorienting it will be for Anna to step into it. She bends her fingers, turning her hand and looking at them from another angle. Frankly, they’re so pointy I’m worried she’ll scratch her own cornea.","“But I asked the woman at the spa what the really rich ladies get, and she said it’s this fancy hard gel. I think I get the urge to have fake nails. I feel like a badass.” Twisting in her seat, she deposits her purse in my lap. “Watch this for a sec?”",106,"Her eyes light up with excitement as she examines her new nails, and I can tell she's already imagining the countless ways she'll be able to use them to her advantage. I, on the other hand, am imagining the countless ways she'll be able to use them to her disadvantage. I try to push the thought aside, focusing instead on the fact that she's finally starting to feel more confident in her new skin. It's a small step, but it's a start. As we finish up at the salon, I can feel a sense of trepidation building in the pit of my stomach. We're getting close to the moment of truth – the moment when Anna will have to face my parents and their...let's say, ""unique"" way of life. I've tried to prepare her as best I can, but I know that nothing can truly prepare someone for the experience of meeting my family. I take a deep breath, trying to calm my nerves as we make our way back to the car. It's time to face the music, and I can only hope that Anna is ready for what's to come."
"“Okay, okay. I’m on my way.” Slinging her purse over my shoulder and collecting our carry-ons, I make my way to the ladies’ room, where","Anna peeks out into the hallway. As soon as she sees me, she reaches forward, grabbing the front of my shirt and jerking me inside.",50,"my sister is waiting for me, her eyes fixed on her phone as she texts our mom to let her know we've landed safely. I take a deep breath, preparing myself for the chaos that is our family reunion. As I enter the restroom, I'm immediately hit with the smell of stale air and the sound of running water. My sister looks up, a mixture of excitement and nervousness on her face. ""Ready for this?"" she asks, tucking her phone into her pocket. I nod, and we share a brief, reassuring smile before making our way out of the restroom and into the crowded airport terminal. The sounds and smells of the airport envelop us, a cacophony of announcements, chatter, and the wail of a distant baby. We weave through the throngs of people, our eyes scanning the sea of faces for a glimpse of our family. My stomach twists with anticipation as we make our way towards the arrivals gate, the familiar faces of our loved ones slowly coming into view."
Apologizing over her shoulder to a woman washing her hands at the sink—“I swear we,aren’t going to have sex in here!”—Anna pulls me into a stall and flips the lock.,31,"weren't supposed to be in here, I think we took a wrong turn somewhere”—Lena pushed through the door and found herself in a long, dimly lit corridor lined with rows of old lockers, the smell of mildew and stale air filling her nostrils. The sound of dripping water echoed through the hallway, and the flickering fluorescent lights above cast eerie shadows on the walls. She quickened her pace, her sneakers squeaking on the worn linoleum floor as she tried to get her bearings. Suddenly, she heard the sound of footsteps behind her, heavy and deliberate, and she spun around, but there was no one there. The woman from the bathroom was nowhere to be seen, and Lena was alone in the deserted corridor, her heart racing with a growing sense of unease."
"“I need you there,” I clarify. “And I need you to look like you’re comfortable with me, comfortable","being married to me. But I don’t need you to pretend to not be Anna Green, Muppet-human hybrid.”",36,"with the situation, and most importantly, comfortable with yourself. I know it's a lot to ask, but I really need you to pull this off. We can't afford to raise any suspicions, not now, not when we're so close. I'll be counting on you to keep up the act, to make it look like we're just two old friends catching up. Can I trust you to do that for me? I'll owe you one, I promise. Just please, don't let me down."
Her eyes go round. “The fam—” Anna shakes her head. “You know what? Never mind. Of,"course you have a plane.” Straightening, she asks, “So, why was I in Cambodia? Photography? Fabric design?”",33,"course, I know what you're referring to, but let's just focus on the task at hand for now. We can discuss the family business later, okay?"" Anna's voice is firm but gentle, a subtle reminder that some topics are better left untouched. She pauses, studying the room as if searching for an escape from the unspoken tension. The air is thick with unasked questions, but Anna's expression remains resolute, a mask of determination that hints at a deeper resolve. As the silence stretches, the sound of ticking clocks and distant whispers seems to grow louder, a reminder that time is running out, and secrets can't stay hidden forever."
"Once, when we were roommates, Anna flew to Seattle with a friend. It had been her first time on an airplane, and she struggled so much navigating the travel website that she brought me her laptop at midnight and asked for help. I finished the transaction for her, prebooked the car","to the airport, and then quietly tracked the ride the day she left to make sure she got there okay. When she got home, she made a point of thanking me for the help. Apparently, the trip itself was fine, but the highlight for her had been flying on an airplane.",102,"rental, and even printed out the boarding passes. She was so grateful that she offered to take me out for a celebratory drink, and we ended up laughing and chatting for hours at a nearby bar. I remember being struck by her adventurous spirit and willingness to try new things, despite feeling anxious about the unknown. That trip to Seattle ended up being a huge success, and Anna returned with stories of exploring the city, visiting the famous Pike Place Market, and even taking a ferry ride to Bainbridge Island. From that moment on, she was hooked on traveling and went on to plan many more trips, always eager to explore new destinations and experience different cultures. As I reflect on that moment, I realize that it was a turning point in our friendship, marking the beginning of a deeper connection and a shared love of adventure that would stay with us for years to come."
"“That person deserves jail time.” She brings the glass to her lips, taking a tiny","sip. “Mmmmm.” Anna turns to meet my eyes. “And by the way, it’s anything over ninety-nine.”",31,"sip of the amber liquid, her eyes never leaving the television screen as the news anchor continues to recount the details of the scandal. The studio lights reflect off the glass, casting a miniature rainbow on the polished surface of the coffee table in front of her. She sets the glass down, her expression unchanging, but a flicker of disgust dances in her eyes. ""It's unbelievable,"" she mutters to herself, shaking her head. The news anchor's voice drones on, but she's no longer listening, lost in her own thoughts of justice and morality. The room falls silent, the only sound the soft hum of the television and the occasional tick of the clock on the wall."
Anna’s smiling at me like I amuse her. “I meant more as,"in, is she nice? Does she have hobbies or a favorite band?”",24,"a metaphor, I suppose,” she says, her eyes sparkling with amusement, “You know, like how some people find solace in the stars on a clear night, or the sound of the ocean waves crashing against the shore, I find solace in the way you make me laugh, even on my worst days.”"
“Oh. Power. I like it. I’m not sure how to wield,"it, but I like it. And you have three siblings, including Jake?”",23,"it, but I can feel its potential coursing through my veins like liquid fire. The words of the ancient prophecy echo in my mind, 'The one who wields the power shall bring balance to the universe.' I look around, trying to make sense of my surroundings, and see the wise old sage standing before me, a knowing glint in his eye. 'You have been chosen,' he says, his voice low and mysterious, 'but the journey ahead will be treacherous, and the power you now possess is a double-edged sword.' I take a deep breath, feeling the weight of the responsibility settle upon me, and nod my head in determination. I am ready to face whatever lies ahead, armed with this newfound power and a fierce determination to fulfill my destiny."
I feel her looking at me for a quiet beat. “I think you’re joking. I’m,not sure.” Anna downs the rest of her prosecco. “A hint of danger. I like it.”,31,"not sure what you're insinuating, but I can assure you, I'm dead serious,"" I say, trying to keep my tone light despite the growing unease in my stomach. She raises an eyebrow, her eyes narrowing slightly as she takes a step closer to me. ""You can't be,"" she says, her voice low and even, but with a hint of amusement dancing in her eyes. ""You're not the type to just... give up like that."" I feel a surge of defensiveness, but I push it down, trying to remain calm. ""What makes you think that?"" I ask, my curiosity getting the better of me. She smiles, a small, enigmatic smile that makes me feel like I'm missing something. ""I know you, remember?"" she says, her voice dripping with an unspoken meaning that I'm not quite sure I understand."
“Is now a good time to discuss how you looked at me like I was lobotomized when I thought,your name was West Weston and yet a man named Kellan McKellan actually exists and will soon be your relative?”,39,"the new policy was a good idea? I mean, I know I'm not the most experienced person in the room, but I'm not completely clueless either. I've been paying attention and trying to learn as much as I can. I just wish you wouldn't look at me like I'm some kind of idiot every time I try to contribute to the conversation. It's really frustrating and makes me feel like my opinions aren't valued. Can we please just have a respectful discussion about this without the condescending attitude?"
I can feel her staring a beat longer before she turns away to hand her,"empty flute to the flight attendant. Anna returns her focus to me. “Okay, what else?”",30,"card to the barista, who raises an eyebrow as he takes in her disheveled appearance. The fluorescent lights overhead seem to hum in sync with the pounding in my head as I try to process what just happened. I glance around the coffee shop, taking in the familiar sights and sounds, but everything feels off. The hissing steam wand, the murmur of hushed conversations, the clinking of cups – it's all just a cacophony of noise that grates on my frazzled nerves. I feel like I'm stuck in some kind of bizarre dream, where nothing makes sense and the rules of reality no longer apply. The woman's words keep echoing in my mind, taunting me with their ambiguity. What did she mean? And why did she have to choose this moment, of all moments, to drop that bombshell?"
"West looks at me with unmasked concern. “Please, Anna,” he","says gently like I’m very, very naive. “Just follow my lead.”",21,"begins, his voice low and soothing, as if trying to calm a frightened animal, ""you have to tell me what's going on. You can't just shut down like this and expect me to do nothing. I know something's wrong, and I'm not leaving until you talk to me."""

"Janet steps close, her hair in a perfect white-blond chignon, her collarbones so defined they’re like hangers holding up her delicate","yellow sundress. I have to assume she has an extremely deft plastic surgeon, because she somehow looks like a twenty-five-year-old sixty-year-old.",42,"neckline, a fragile-looking thing that seems to defy gravity as she moves. Her eyes, a deep shade of blue that seems almost purple in the dim light of the room, lock onto mine, and for a moment, we just stare at each other, the air thick with unspoken words. I can feel the weight of her gaze, like a physical touch, and I have to fight the urge to look away, to break the spell that's been cast. But I don't, I hold her gaze, my heart pounding in my chest, as I wait for her to speak, to break the silence that's stretched out between us like a challenge."
"“Anna, darling!” The woman I need to remember is my actual mother-in-law air-kisses","both of my cheeks. “My goodness, in person your hair is so pink!”",26,"both of my cheeks, her perfume and the faint scent of last night's wine wafting up to greet me. I force a bright smile onto my face, trying to appear more awake than I feel. ""Mother, you look stunning,"" I say, taking in her perfectly coiffed hair and the elegant silver dress that hugs her curves in all the right places. She beams with pride, her eyes sparkling with a knowing glint that makes me wonder what she's really thinking. My husband, Alex, stands beside her, his eyes fixed on me with a mixture of amusement and warning, as if daring me to say something wrong. I feel a surge of anxiety as I realize I still can't quite recall her name."
“Okay. Well. That’s nice.” Janet pats his hand in hers. “Don’t forget about the cocktail party at six.”,"She leans in, kissing her son’s cheek again. “Can’t wait to get some time with you all to myself.”",37,"He nods, still distracted, and Janet can tell he's already mentally preparing for the evening ahead. She lets go of his hand and stands up, smoothing out her dress as she glances around the room to make sure everything is in order. The sound of clinking glasses and muted chatter drifts in from the living room, where their guests are mingling. Janet takes a deep breath, pasting a bright smile on her face as she heads out to join them, leaving her husband to his thoughts. As she disappears into the crowd, he finally looks up, his eyes scanning the room until they land on the clock on the mantle. 5:45. He has just over an hour to pull himself together before the party really gets underway."
"“Anna,” he says finally, very gently. “The truth is, you could just smile on my arm and be okay. I promise",I’m not trying to leave you unprepared. The sad reality is that my parents are unlikely to pay you much attention regardless.”,43,"that I will take care of everything else. You won't have to worry about a thing. Just be yourself, and I'll handle the rest. I know it's a lot to ask, but I really think this could be the start of something special. We could be happy together, Anna. I can feel it. And I know that I can make you happy, if you just give me the chance. So what do you say, Anna? Will you take a chance on me? Will you be my partner, my friend, and maybe, just maybe, something more?"
"I walk back inside, realizing I’d been so focused on the sleeping situation, I haven’t properly flailed over the sheer bliss that is our bungalow. In fact, I’m pretty sure the only thing in here I could afford is the roll of eco-friendly toilet paper I can clearly see from where I stand. And even that looks pretty fancy. There’s a real Isle Esme feel to the decor (if you know, you know), with carved bamboo, recycled teak, jellyfish light fixtures, and a massive canopy bed. Wide windows and the open entrance","bring the outside in and allow me to glance over at West, who seems to be mid–mental spiral, managing to look even more morose than he did thirty seconds ago. Isle Esme vibes or not, there will be no headboard breaking here. Near one wall is a chest with our names stamped into the top, a pair of towels folded to look like stingrays, and a jar of chocolate chip cookies that are probably made with the world’s most expensive chocolate but hey, Gede did say it was all-inclusive. I help myself.",184,"allow for an abundance of natural light to pour in, illuminating the space and making it feel even more spacious than it already is. I can almost imagine the sound of waves gently lapping at the shore outside, and the warm breeze rustling the palm fronds that seem to be swaying in rhythm with the wind. The air is thick with the scent of frangipani and hibiscus, and I can feel the stress and fatigue of the past few days melting away with each breath.  As I take in the beauty of our little slice of paradise, I notice the attention to detail that has gone into every aspect of the bungalow's design. From the hand-woven baskets that hold an assortment of luxurious linens and plush towels, to the delicate shell wind chimes that hang from the rafters, every element seems to have been carefully curated to create a sense of serenity and tranquility.  I wander over to the massive canopy bed, running my hand over the intricate carvings that adorn the wooden frame. The mattress looks inviting, piled high with plush pillows and a soft, white duvet that seems to be begging me to dive in and take a nap. I resist the temptation, knowing that I need to explore the rest of the bungalow and see what other wonders it holds.  As I make my way through the space, I notice a small, secluded area that appears to be a private outdoor shower. The sound of running water is like music to my ears, and I can almost imagine the feeling of warm water cascading down my skin as I stand under the showerhead, surrounded by the sights and sounds of nature. It's the perfect way to unwind after a long day, and I make a mental note to try it out as soon as possible.  Despite the many wonders of our bungalow, I'm still a little concerned about the sleeping situation. I make a mental note to speak with the resort staff and see if there's anything that can be done to address the issue. For now, though, I'm just going to take a deep breath, relax, and let the beauty of our surroundings wash over me."
"I have a lot of faults. I drink milk from the carton, I never make my bed, I am slothful, and sometimes I’ll just set the new roll of toilet paper on top of the empty roll instead of changing it. A monster. I am also gluttonous: I don’t want a few peanut M&M’s; I want the entire bag. Why have one","margarita when three is such a nice, satisfying number? Everyone knows why! And that’s why I go back for seconds right now. But karma is Team West: his eyes open just as I glance again. They widen and he reaches down to cup his Goddamn before he turns, facing away. “Anna,” he says, his voice spluttering in the water’s spray. “Are you peeking?”",125,"cookie when you can have a whole package? I have no self-control when it comes to sweets, and I know it's not healthy, but I just can't help myself. My friends and family have learned to hide the treats when I'm around, or else they'll be gone in a matter of minutes. I'm also a bit of a procrastinator, always putting off until tomorrow what I can do today. But despite all my flaws, I'm a happy person, and I've learned to laugh at myself and not take life too seriously. I mean, what's the point of being perfect, anyway? It's the imperfections that make life interesting, right? I'd much rather be a lovable, quirky mess than a boring, perfect robot. And who knows, maybe one day I'll learn to make my bed and change the toilet paper roll without being reminded. But until then, I'll just keep on being me, flaws and all."
"He was right. Focus was always a challenge, and apparently it didn’t end with baseball. I came here with the knowledge that all I need to do is limp this lie to September, and I can finally exhale, but we’re less than an hour into this farce and I’m already off track:","I peeked, and it was a huge mistake. It’s not that I didn’t know Anna was attractive all those years ago; it’s that we barely saw each other, and I was so driven to finish my degree and never have to work for my father again that Anna—attractive or not—was easy to overlook.",105,"my mind is wandering to the upcoming weekend, and the plans I made with Rachel, and the fact that I still need to pick up her birthday gift. I force myself to refocus on the task at hand, but it's no use. My brain is a jumbled mess of thoughts, and I can feel my anxiety spiking. I take a deep breath and try to calm myself down, reminding myself that it's just a meeting, and it's not the end of the world if I don't have all the answers. But the voice in my head is relentless, taunting me with all the things that could go wrong. I glance around the room, hoping to find some inspiration, but all I see are the expectant faces of my colleagues, waiting for me to lead the way. I clear my throat, trying to sound confident, and begin to speak, but the words feel hollow, even to my own ears. I'm just going through the motions, trying to make it to the end of this meeting without completely imploding. But as I glance at the clock, I realize that we're only 20 minutes in, and I still have a long way to go."
"I smile at her and cup a hand to the side of my mouth, whispering, “It’s okay.” Truthfully, I love that she thinks about this. I love that she’s","horrified by that price. I’m horrified, too. It’s a good thing Anna isn’t my real wife; I would constantly worry that my proximity to this world would destroy her.",58,"thinking about the future and our life together. It shows me that she's invested in us, that she's thinking about the what-ifs and the maybes. I find it adorable, the way she worries about things that might not even happen. It's a quality that I admire, one that makes me feel like she's truly mine. As I look at her, I can see the concern etched on her face, and I want to reassure her, to tell her that everything will be okay. I take a step closer, my voice barely above a whisper, and say, ""We'll figure it out, together."" Her eyes lock onto mine, and I can see the tension in her body begin to ease. She smiles, a small, tentative smile, and I know that she's starting to feel better. I wrap my arms around her, pulling her close, and hold her there, feeling her warmth and her love. In this moment, everything feels right with the world."
"Her hand falls away. “That’s Anna motherfucking Green-hyphen-Weston to you.” She lets out a happy squeal, jogging over",to hug him as well as she can without spilling the shots on either of them. “You look amazing!”,37,"to where I'm standing, a huge grin spreading across her face. ""I'm so glad you're here,"" she says, throwing her arms around me in a tight hug. I laugh and hug her back, feeling a little overwhelmed by her enthusiasm. We stand there for a moment, holding each other and grinning like idiots, before she finally pulls back and looks me up and down. ""You look amazing,"" she says, her eyes shining with excitement. ""I'm so glad you decided to come."" I smile and thank her, feeling a little self-conscious about my outfit, but Anna just waves her hand dismissively. ""Don't be ridiculous, you look stunning,"" she says. ""Now come on, let's go get some drinks. I'm buying."" She grabs my arm and starts pulling me towards the bar, chatting excitedly about the party and the people we're going to meet. I follow her, feeling a little more at ease now that we're moving and doing something. As we walk, I take in the sights and sounds of the party, trying to get a sense of what's going on. The music is loud and the lights are flashing, and there are people everywhere, laughing and talking and having a good time. Anna and I make our way through the crowd, exchanging greetings and hugs with people as we go. Eventually, we make it to the bar and Anna orders us a couple of drinks. We stand there for a while, sipping our drinks and chatting, and I start to feel more and more at home. Anna is a great host, and she makes sure that I'm introduced to everyone and that I have a good time. As the night wears on, I find myself relaxing and enjoying myself, laughing and joking with Anna and the other guests. It's a really fun party, and I'm glad that I decided to come."
"The two of them walk back to me, and Jake looks over",his shoulder to make sure we’re alone. “How are my favorite liars doing?”,25,"at me with a mixture of confusion and curiosity, while Emily seems to be deep in thought, her eyes fixed on the ground as if searching for something. As they approach, I can sense a palpable tension between them, and I wonder what could have caused it. Jake breaks the silence, his voice low and cautious, ""Dude, what's going on? You've been acting weird all day."" Emily's gaze slowly rises to meet mine, and I can see a hint of a warning in her eyes, as if urging me to tread carefully with my response."
"“Describe her,” Jake says, leaning in, his hair falling over his forehead in thick waves. There are moments where I see the man he could someday be: playful but grounded, flirtatious but loyal,",clever but humble. I want to know that version of him and worry he will forever be frozen in this caricature of the irresponsible youngest son as long as he works for Weston’s.,66,"and in those moments, I feel a flutter in my chest that I've never experienced before. It's as if my heart is trying to tell me something, but I'm not quite sure what. I take a deep breath and focus on the task at hand, trying to push aside the distraction that is Jake's charming smile. ""She's... um, she's got long, curly brown hair and bright green eyes,"" I begin, trying to recall every detail. ""Her smile is infectious, and she has this way of making you feel like you're the only person in the room when she's talking to you."" Jake's eyes light up with interest, and he leans in closer, his face inches from mine. ""Go on,"" he encourages, his voice low and husky. I feel a shiver run down my spine as I continue, trying to paint a vivid picture of the mysterious woman who has captured Jake's attention. ""She's got a small tattoo of a sun on her left ankle and a scar above her right eyebrow from a childhood accident. She's always dressed in the latest fashion trends, but she's not afraid to speak her mind and stand up for what she believes in."" Jake's eyes never leave mine as I speak, and I can sense his intensity, his desire to know more about this enigmatic woman. I wonder what it is about her that has captivated him so, and whether I'll ever be able to uncover the truth."
"Anna barks out a bawdy laugh before covering her mouth with her hand. “Sorry,” she says",from behind it. The diamond on her ring flashes in the flickering light. “That surprised me.”,32,"as she tries to compose herself, her eyes sparkling with mirth. The others at the table join in, their laughter echoing through the crowded café, drawing curious glances from nearby patrons. As they settle down, Jack leans in, a mischievous grin spreading across his face. ""So, Anna, what's the story behind that laugh?"" he asks, his eyes twinkling with amusement. Anna's cheeks flush, but she launches into a tale of her misadventures at the office, leaving the group in stitches once again."
"“Good. Anna has no poker face. How’s she taking everything?” he asks, and","I know what he’s referring to: the planes, the island, the money. The family.",27,"he can't help but chuckle at the thought of her trying to keep a straight face. ""Honestly, she's a bit of a mess,"" I reply, shaking my head in amusement. ""She's been trying to stay strong, but I can tell she's scared. We all are, to be honest."" I pause, taking a deep breath before continuing. ""But we're trying to stay positive, for her sake as much as our own. We have to believe that everything will work out in the end."" I glance over at him, searching for reassurance. ""Do you really think we can trust this plan?"""
"With a laugh, Jake rids himself of our shot glasses and snags two tumblers of whiskey off a passing tray. He","hands me one before lifting his own. “Well, whatever. To the final few months: if you pull this off, you’re free.”",42,"hands me one and we clink them together in a silent toast, the amber liquid sloshing precariously close to the rim as we take a swig. The burn of the whiskey down my throat is a welcome distraction from the tension that's been building between us all night. I glance around the crowded room, the dim lighting and pulsating music making it feel like we're in our own little world. Jake catches my eye and raises an eyebrow, a mischievous glint sparkling in his gaze. I feel a shiver run down my spine as he leans in close, his voice low and husky in my ear. ""You ready to get out of here?"" he asks, his breath sending a shiver down my neck. I nod, and he takes my hand, leading me through the throng of people towards the door. The cool night air hits us like a slap in the face as we emerge onto the sidewalk, the sounds of the bar fading into the distance. We walk in silence for a few blocks, the only sound the click of our heels on the pavement. Finally, Jake speaks up, his voice low and serious. ""I've been wanting to talk to you about something,"" he says, his eyes locked on mine. I feel a flutter in my chest as I wonder what he's going to say."
"He looks past me at the party, and I take stock of how he seems from the outside. He’s got Dad’s dark wavy hair and light brown eyes, but like me, he got his height from our mother, who","is almost six feet tall without the benefit of heels. Jake is good-looking, charismatic, and always up for some (mostly) good-hearted shit-stirring. My stomach sours with guilt for what I’m keeping from him. What I could potentially fuck up.",78,"was a towering figure in our lives, both physically and emotionally. I can see the sharp jawline and prominent nose that we both inherited from her, and for a moment, I'm taken aback by how much he resembles her. But as he turns back to me, his expression softens, and I'm reminded of the countless times he's been there for me, offering a listening ear and a comforting presence. We may not have always seen eye-to-eye, but in this moment, I'm grateful for the bond we share. As we stand there, the sounds of the party fade into the background, and it's just the two of us, suspended in a moment of understanding. I can feel the weight of our shared history, the laughter and the tears, the triumphs and the struggles. And in this instant, I know that no matter what the future holds, we'll face it together, as siblings and as friends."
"She laughs, angling her wrist so the diamond catches the lights overhead. “I know, right? For six months I just walked",around taking photos where I had to casually point at something with my left hand.” She scans the crowd. “Where’s Anna?”,42,"around with this huge rock on my finger, and I never got tired of it. People would stare, and I'd catch them staring, and I'd just smile and think, 'Yeah, I know, it's gorgeous.' But the best part was when my friends would ask to see it, and I'd take it off and hand it to them, and they'd just gasp. I mean, it's not every day you get to hold a diamond that big in your hand. And the way it sparkled, even in low light... it was just mesmerizing. I felt like a queen, you know? Like I was wearing a little piece of royalty on my finger. And the best part was, it was all mine. Well, mine and my husband's, of course. But still, it was this beautiful symbol of our love, and I felt so lucky to have it."
"I look up, too, searching the room again. She’s over by the dance floor, jumping around with little Nixon’s hands in hers.","The band is playing covers of pop hits, and Anna is entirely in her element: laughing, dancing, blissfully forgetting where she is.",44,"Her eyes meet mine, and she flashes a bright, carefree smile, the kind that makes my heart skip a beat. I watch, mesmerized, as she spins Nixon around, his giggles echoing through the music. The scene is so joyful, so full of life, that for a moment, I forget about the tension between us, forget about the uncertainty that's been plaguing me. I forget about everything except the way she looks right now, lost in the music and the moment, her beauty shining like a beacon in the crowded room. As I stand there, frozen in admiration, she catches my eye again, and this time, she beckons me over, her smile inviting me to join in on the fun."
"Janet smiles tightly. “Exactly.” Welp, there it is. She turns her",laser focus to me. “How do your professors react to your hair?”,23,"head to the side, her eyes drifting toward the window as she tries to process the weight of the conversation. The words hang in the air like a challenge, each one a reminder of the fragile balance they've maintained for so long. She can feel the tension building, a slow-burning fire that threatens to consume them all. Her mind begins to wander, searching for a way to defuse the situation, to find a middle ground that will satisfy everyone. But for now, she remains frozen, her gaze fixed on some point outside, her thoughts a jumbled mess of emotions and uncertainty."
"“It’s unlikely,” I say, and every head turns my way. “Everyone needs seven to nine hours of sleep a night. You can try to convince yourself","you don’t need more, but over time you’ll build up a sleep debt. It probably affects your mental and physical health more than you realize, Alex.”",52,"that you're getting by on less, but your body will eventually catch up with you. I've seen it time and time again - people who think they can function on fumes, only to crash and burn when they least expect it. The science is clear: sleep is not a luxury, it's a necessity. And yet, so many of us treat it like an afterthought, something to be sacrificed in the name of productivity or entertainment. But the truth is, getting enough sleep is essential for our physical and mental health. It's when our bodies repair and recharge, when our brains process and consolidate memories, and when our immune systems get a much-needed boost. So, I urge you all to take sleep seriously. Make it a priority. Your body - and mind - will thank you."
"“And what’s the deal with Alex? Based on the way you talked about him on the plane, I expected you","two to jovially poke at each other, but that was like dragging a proverbial sword through each other with your eyeballs.”",41,"to be a lot closer. But now that I've met him, I'm starting to think you two aren't as tight as I thought. He seems nice enough, but there's definitely some tension between you two. Did something happen that I should know about? You were going on and on about how great he was, how you guys had been friends since college, and how he was always there for you. But now that I've seen the way he looks at you, I'm starting to think there's more to the story. Is there something you're not telling me? Did you two used to date or something? I'm getting some serious mixed signals here."
"“Well, mostly because he’s an asshole. But also, kids growing up in a normal family get to be themselves, whoever that may be. But in families like","ours, one where everything basically revolves around keeping a single person happy—my dad—everybody has a role. My therapist used to refer to Alex as a flying monkey.”",54,"his, where the parents are always in the public eye, the kids are expected to be perfect, to be these miniature versions of their parents. They don't get to make mistakes, they don't get to have their own interests or passions, they have to fit into this predetermined mold. And that's not fair to them. I mean, think about it, when you're growing up, you're still figuring out who you are, what you like, what you don't like. But when you're a kid in a famous family, you don't get that luxury. You're already being molded into this certain image, this certain persona, and it's suffocating. I feel bad for them, I really do. They deserve to be able to make their own choices, to be able to screw up and learn from their mistakes, just like everyone else. But no, they're stuck in this bubble, this constant scrutiny, and it's just not healthy."
"“Like in The Wizard of Oz? Alex was my dad’s willing henchman, doing everything he said, kissing his ass, stirring up","shit just to turn us all in, then sit back and look like the good guy. He’s never grown out of it.”",43,"trouble wherever he went, and making sure everyone knew who was boss. My dad was the king of the castle, and Alex was his loyal subject, always ready to do his bidding. I, on the other hand, was the rebellious one, always questioning authority and pushing boundaries. It was a dynamic that had been in place for as long as I could remember, and it was one that I had grown tired of. I longed for the day when I could break free from my dad's grasp and forge my own path, but for now, I was stuck in this never-ending cycle of obedience and resentment. As I watched Alex scurry around, doing my dad's bidding, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disdain for my brother's weakness. Why couldn't he see that our dad was manipulating him, using him for his own gain? Why couldn't he stand up for himself, just once? I sighed inwardly, knowing that I would have to be the one to take a stand, to challenge our dad's authority and fight for what was rightfully mine."
"“What does that mean?” I ask. If Alex knew enough, he wouldn’t try",to take West down? Is this about the mysterious loophole in the trust?,26,"to explain it to me in such a vague way. He'd just tell me straight out, but instead, he's being cryptic, which only makes me more anxious. I take a step closer to him, trying to read his expression, but his eyes are fixed on something behind me. I turn to see what's caught his attention, but there's nothing out of the ordinary - just the usual rows of old bookshelves and dusty artifacts that line the walls of the archive room. I turn back to Alex, my curiosity getting the better of me. ""What is it?"" I press him, trying to keep my voice low despite the growing sense of unease in my chest. Alex's gaze snaps back to mine, and for a moment, we just stare at each other, the only sound the faint hum of the fluorescent lights overhead."
West sits on the bench and pulls a shoe off. I set my clutch down on a shelf in the open closet. “I’m thinking Alex will take a keen,"interest in exactly how happy we seem.” I narrow my eyes, staring into the distance. “West… this assignment is no longer just ‘show up and wear a wedding ring.’ ”",59,"interest in the new project, considering his background in marketing,"" I say, trying to sound casual despite the fact that I've been stressing about this meeting all week. West looks up at me, his eyes squinting slightly as he works on untying his other shoe. ""Yeah, I think you're right,"" he says, his voice low and thoughtful. ""But we need to make sure we're prepared for any questions he might have. Do you have the Johnson report ready?"" I nod, feeling a surge of confidence. ""It's right here,"" I say, pulling out a folder from my bag. ""I've highlighted the key points and made some notes on the potential risks and benefits."" West nods, taking the folder from me and flipping through it quickly. ""Looks good,"" he says. ""Let's go over it one more time before Alex gets here, just to make sure we're on the same page."" I nod, feeling a sense of relief wash over me. With West by my side, I know we can handle whatever this meeting throws our way."
"I woke up around two this morning to find Anna wrapped around me. Despite what she’d told me about sleeping in one place all night, at some point she’d migrated across the massive bed to throw a","leg over my hip, send an arm over my torso, and press her face to my neck. It took monumental focus to not go hard against her inner thigh, and because of it, I’d slept like absolute shit.",75,"leg over mine and snuggle into my side. I lay there for a while, feeling her warmth and listening to her soft breathing. It was comforting, and I found myself drifting off to sleep again, lulled by the sound of her gentle snores. When I woke up again, the room was filled with the soft glow of dawn, and Anna was still wrapped around me, her head resting on my chest. I gently stroked her hair, feeling a sense of peace wash over me. It was moments like these that I cherished, the quiet intimacy of being with someone you loved. As I lay there, I couldn't help but think about how much my life had changed since Anna had come into it. She had brought a sense of joy and purpose that I had been missing for so long. I felt grateful for her presence in my life, and I knew that I would do anything to make her happy. As the morning light crept into the room, I knew that it was time to get up and start the day, but I was reluctant to disturb Anna, who was still sleeping peacefully. I lay there for a while longer, watching her sleep, and feeling grateful for this moment of tranquility."
"My father’s question penetrates my fog, finally, and I straighten, pushing my salt-water-and-sweat damp hair off my forehead. The sun has only","just come up and it’s already sweltering. I bet Anna has already kicked off the blankets, letting the air cool her overheated skin.",45,"just begun its ascent over the water, but already its rays are like a thousand needles pricking at my skin. I squint, raising a hand to shield my eyes, and take a deep breath of the salty air. The smell of seaweed and fish fills my lungs, and for a moment, I forget about the strange, unsettling feeling that's been growing inside me since we set out on this trip. My father's voice brings me back to reality, and I turn to face him, trying to focus on his words. He's standing at the helm, his eyes fixed on the horizon, his jaw set in a determined line. I can tell he's worried, but he's trying not to show it. I follow his gaze, scanning the water for any sign of what's ahead, but all I see is the endless blue expanse stretching out before us."
"“JESUS CHRIST,” I BLURT, the second I turn at the corner of our bridge and step onto the deck of our bungalow. Anna is curled up in","a papasan, with a sketch pad in her seemingly bare lap. Honestly, from the first glimpse I get, I think she might be naked. “What are you doing?”",55,"the oversized hammock, her eyes closed, and a peaceful smile on her face. The warm sunlight casts a golden glow on her skin, and her chest rises and falls with each gentle breath. I feel a pang of guilt for disturbing her serene moment, but my excitement gets the better of me. I rush towards her, almost tripping over my own feet in the process. ""Anna, wake up! You won't believe what I just saw!"" I exclaim, trying to contain my enthusiasm. She slowly opens her eyes, and they sparkle with amusement as she takes in my frantic expression. ""What is it?"" she asks, her voice husky from sleep. I take a deep breath, hardly able to get the words out. ""I saw a dolphin! A real, live dolphin, swimming in the ocean just beneath the bridge!"" Anna's eyes widen, and she sits up, her interest piqued. ""No way! Let me see!"" she exclaims, already swinging her legs over the side of the hammock. I grin, knowing that this is going to be an adventure we'll both never forget."
"Anna follows me. She’s loosely made the bed, but it still looks rumpled.",Slept in. By both of us. I squeeze my eyes shut against the reminder.,27,"She's left her hair tie on the bedside table, and a few strands of her dark hair are still tangled in it. The room smells faintly of her perfume, a sweet scent that lingers in the air. I can almost hear the sound of her humming as she got ready, a gentle tune that always seems to calm me. I take a deep breath, feeling a pang of nostalgia wash over me as I realize she's really gone. The silence in the room is almost deafening, a stark contrast to the usual chatter and laughter that fills our space. I glance around, taking in the familiar surroundings, but everything feels different now that she's not here. I notice the faint indentation on the pillow where her head rested, and my heart skips a beat as I wonder when she'll be back to fill the space beside me."
I sigh. I know she’s right but I’m already sleep-deprived and functioning on less than full brain power today.,I’m not sure I’m capable of dealing with both my family and Anna in this suit after last night. “Fine.”,39,"My mind is foggy, and all I can think about is crawling back into bed and hiding under the covers. I rub my temples, trying to ward off the impending headache that's been threatening to strike all morning. I know I need to focus, but my brain feels like it's stuck in neutral, refusing to shift into gear. I take a deep breath and try to shake off the fatigue, knowing I have to push through this meeting and get some work done. But as I glance over at my colleague, who's watching me with a concerned expression, I can tell she's not buying my attempt at bravado. She knows me too well, and she can see right through my tired eyes to the exhaustion that's lurking beneath."
“Oh!” Anna jerks a hand over her eyes. “Your Goddamn! Right there!” She turns away. “Sorry! I just—spaced,out—on your—God. And you’re not even harrrrrrr—Fuck me.” She coughs. “Okay. I’ll just meet you down at the restaurant.”,37,"out for a second. I didn't mean to stare,"" she says, her voice muffled by her hand. The sound of her embarrassed laughter fills the air as she takes a deep breath, composing herself. ""I'm so sorry, that was completely unprofessional of me."" She slowly lowers her hand, her eyes scanning the room as if searching for an escape or a distraction from the awkwardness that has settled in. Her gaze finally meets his, a mix of embarrassment and amusement dancing in her eyes. ""Please, let's just...pretend that didn't happen, okay?"""
"I can feel Anna’s eyes on the side of my face. This is how it always starts with Alex, and whatever suspicion he has about my marriage will only make it","worse. I know it’s irrational and a remnant of how we used to one-up each other for our dad’s approval when we were kids, but I want to beat him. At everything.",63,"worse. I try to focus on the conversation, but my mind is already racing with the possibilities. What could Alex have discovered? Is it something I've done, or is it just his imagination running wild? I can feel my heart beating faster, and I know I need to calm down before I say something I'll regret. I take a deep breath and try to focus on the present moment, but my eyes keep drifting towards Alex, searching for any sign of what's going on in his head. The tension between us is palpable, and I can tell that Anna is starting to pick up on it. She's always been perceptive, and I know she'll be able to tell that something is off. I just hope she doesn't say anything, not now, not when things are already so precarious. I try to push the thoughts aside and focus on the conversation, but it's no use. My mind is already made up - I need to talk to Alex, and I need to do it now."
"Anna slams the brakes on this line of thinking by putting an arm around my back, resting the other hand on my stomach","and gently scratching, just like she unconsciously did last night. I work to suppress a shiver. Turning, she looks at him over her shoulder.",47,"and giving it a gentle squeeze. I feel a rush of warmth at her touch, and my mind immediately shifts from the dark thoughts that had begun to creep in. She pulls me close, her breath whispering against my ear as she says, ""We'll get through this together, okay?"" The words are simple, but they hold a weight that settles deep within me, calming the storm that had started to brew. I nod, feeling a sense of gratitude towards her, and she holds me for a moment longer before releasing me and taking a step back. Her eyes lock onto mine, searching for any sign of lingering distress, and I force a small smile to reassure her. It's a fragile thing, but it's enough to convince her that I'm okay, and she nods before turning to lead me back to the car. As we walk, the silence between us is no longer oppressive, but rather a comfortable quiet, filled with the promise of support and understanding."
"Eko goes through the basics of paddling, giving us tips about what areas of the",reef to avoid as we approach. “Is everyone comfortable with the basics of kayaking?” she asks.,31,"blade to use for different strokes, how to position our bodies for maximum efficiency, and how to navigate through tight spaces. As we make our way down the river, Eko points out various landmarks and shares stories about the local ecosystem and the history of the area. We learn about the different types of plants and animals that call the river home, and how the community has worked to protect and preserve the environment. The sun beats down on us, but the cool water and gentle breeze make the experience comfortable and enjoyable. As we round a bend in the river, we catch sight of a stunning waterfall in the distance, its misty veil rising into the air like a mystical aura. Eko smiles and nods, as if to say, ""This is what we've been waiting for."" We paddle closer, the roar of the falls growing louder, and feel the excitement build in our chests."
"I reach back, pulling my T-shirt up and off, tossing it to the side. Alex hesitates and","then does the same, his expression turning homicidal when I smirk down at his soft little paunch.",34,"then looks away, a faint blush rising to his cheeks as I stand before him in just my jeans and a sports bra. I take a deep breath, trying to calm my racing heart, and begin to make my way towards the water's edge. The cool liquid envelops my toes, and I let out a sigh of relief as I wade in deeper, the tension in my shoulders slowly easing. Alex remains where he is, his eyes fixed on some point beyond me, his jaw clenched in a mixture of frustration and restraint. I can sense his struggle, his desire to join me warring with his need to maintain control. I take another step forward, the water lapping at my knees, and then turn back to face him, a challenge in my eyes. ""Aren't you coming in?"" I ask, my voice low and husky, the sound carrying across the water. Alex's gaze snaps back to mine, his eyes burning with a fierce intensity as he takes a step forward, and then another, until he's standing at the water's edge, his eyes locked on mine. For a moment, we just stare at each other, the only sound the gentle lapping of the water against the shore. Then, with a swift motion, Alex reaches down and pulls off his own shirt, his eyes never leaving mine as he tosses it aside and wades into the water, his movements fluid and powerful. I watch him, my heart pounding in my chest, as he moves closer and closer, until he's standing right in front of me, the water swirling around our legs. We're so close, I can feel the heat emanating from his body, and I know that I'm playing with fire, but I just can't help myself. I reach out, my hand brushing against his, and he doesn't pull away. Instead, he wraps his fingers around mine, his grip warm and strong, and pulls me closer, until our bodies are almost touching. I look up at him, my eyes locked on his, and he looks back, his eyes burning with a fierce desire. We're so close, I can feel his breath on my skin, and I know that I'm on the verge of something big, something that could change everything. And then, just as suddenly as it started, everything stops. Alex's eyes flicker, and he releases my hand, taking a step back as he looks away, his jaw clenched in frustration. I'm left standing there, feeling confused and more than a little disappointed, wondering what just happened, and why he pulled away. But as I look at him, I see the struggle in his eyes, the war between his desire and his need for control, and I know that this isn't over. Not by a long shot."
"Alex snorts, looking at her derisively, like she’s an idiot. In a hot","flush, my hackles are up, and every rational thought goes out the window.",26,"second, his expression changes, and he's the one who looks like an idiot, his face turning bright red as he realizes what he's just said. He tries to recover, but it's too late, the damage is done, and she's already walking away, leaving him standing there, feeling like a fool. He calls out to her, but she doesn't turn around, and he's left standing alone, wondering how he managed to mess things up so badly. He takes a deep breath and tries to shake off the feeling of embarrassment, but it's hard to do when he knows he's just made a huge mistake."
"“Course you are, sweetheart,” I say, steadying my voice and looking down at Anna.",“I went running without you this morning and you really let me have it.”,28,"Her eyes are wide with a mix of fear and uncertainty, and I can tell she's trying to process everything that's happening. I take a deep breath and try to reassure her, ""We'll get through this together, okay? We just need to stay calm and figure out our next move."" I glance around the room, taking in our surroundings and looking for any possible escape routes or clues that might help us. The dim lighting and musty smell make my stomach turn, but I push the feeling aside and focus on keeping Anna safe. I gently squeeze her hand, trying to offer what little comfort I can, and begin to scan the room more thoroughly, searching for anything that might aid in our escape."
"“We work out together every morning.” I’m speaking to Alex but holding Anna’s gaze. Maybe it’s the pent-up frustration from last night, or maybe my brother just","brings out the worst in me and the best way to drag him is through his wife’s dissatisfaction, but I keep going. “Gets the blood flowing, doesn’t it?”",55,"really knows how to push my buttons, but I can feel the tension between us, thick and heavy like a challenge. Alex raises an eyebrow, oblivious to the undercurrents, and says, ""That's great, you two should come with me to the gym sometime."" Anna's eyes never leave mine, a spark of amusement dancing in their depths, as if she knows a secret I don't. I force a smile, trying to play it cool, but my heart is racing with anticipation. The air is charged with unspoken words, and I can feel the weight of our unresolved argument hanging precariously in the balance. I know I need to tread carefully, but a part of me is itching for a confrontation, eager to clear the air and put an end to the simmering tension between us. Little do I know, today is going to be a day of revelations, one that will change everything."
"And that much is immediately apparent. She trips as she tries to climb in. I hold the boat steady for her, but she still ends up getting","in backward and then having to awkwardly turn around in the tiny space. I pretend to scratch my shoulder with my chin, glancing behind us. Fuck. Alex noticed.",55,"her feet wet as she struggles to find her balance. I try to help her, but she brushes me off, her face set in a determined expression. Finally, she manages to settle into the seat, her chest heaving with exertion. I push off from the shore and begin to row, the oars dipping smoothly into the water as we glide across the lake. The sun beats down on us, warming my skin, and I feel a sense of peace wash over me. But as I glance over at my companion, I can see the tension still etched on her face, and I wonder what's troubling her. We row in silence for a while, the only sound the gentle lapping of the water against the hull, before I finally break the silence. ""Hey, you okay?"" I ask, trying to keep my voice light. She turns to me, her eyes narrowing slightly as she considers her response."
"Just then, Anna looks over and lets out a high-pitched shriek. “West! A sea turtle!” She","leans to the side, and her oar slides off her lap and into the clear water.",32,"points excitedly towards the water, her eyes shining with excitement. West immediately stops what he's doing and rushes over to where Anna is standing, his eyes scanning the waves. As he looks out at the water, he sees the turtle swimming slowly towards the shore, its shell glistening in the sunlight. West can't help but grin at the sight, feeling a sense of wonder and awe wash over him. He turns to Anna, who is still staring at the turtle in amazement, and says, ""Let's go take a closer look!"" Anna nods eagerly, and the two of them carefully make their way down to the water's edge, not wanting to scare the turtle away."
"“He and I have never been close,” I say quickly, suddenly and deeply uninterested in spending the morning anywhere but right","here with Anna. “I think from the moment he was born, the only thing he cared about was impressing our father.”",42,"here, in this quiet, peaceful space. The sunlight streaming through the window highlights the dust motes dancing in the air, and I feel a sense of tranquility wash over me. My companion's eyes narrow slightly, as if they're trying to read between the lines, but I'm not about to elaborate. The tension between us is palpable, a living, breathing thing that seems to pulse with every beat of my heart. I can feel their gaze on me, but I refuse to meet it, instead focusing on the delicate patterns etched into the windowpane. The silence stretches out, a heavy, oppressive blanket that threatens to suffocate us both. I'm not sure how much longer I can maintain this facade, but for now, it's all I have. The stillness is shattered by the sound of footsteps echoing from the hallway, growing louder with each passing moment. My companion's head snaps towards the door, their eyes flashing with a mixture of curiosity and wariness. I, on the other hand, feel a spark of hope ignite within me. Maybe, just maybe, this interruption will be the reprieve I so desperately need."

He’s probably jealous because you’re tall and hot and smart and he’s short and—”,30,"brother, and it's not just about the video games, it's about everything, from racing to the dinner table to who can eat the most pancakes in one sitting, and Alex has always been the type of person who hates to lose, so he's constantly trying to one-up you, but no matter how hard he tries, he just can't seem to catch a break, and it's become this ongoing joke between the two of you, with Alex getting more and more frustrated and you just laughing it off and teasing him about being the ""old, slow brother""."
"Anna pulls her hand from the water and sends it absently down her stomach, leaving a trail of water that quickly pulls",into droplets and evaporates in the heat. “Is it weird that we lived together for two years and you don’t remember this?”,44,"into a tiny rivulet that trickles down her navel and disappears into the waistband of her swimsuit. She stands up, water dripping from her hair and shoulders, and gazes out at the lake, her eyes squinting against the bright sunlight reflecting off the water's surface. The sound of children's laughter and the occasional shout from a parent or lifeguard carries across the water, mingling with the calls of seagulls wheeling overhead. Anna takes a deep breath, feeling the warm sun on her skin and the cool water evaporating from her hair, and smiles to herself, savoring the simple pleasure of a summer afternoon by the lake."
"Gingerly, Anna lifts the ice, gasping at the small wound there.","She sets the ice back down, flushed, and nods decisively. “You’ll live.”",23,"A faint trickle of blood seeps from the cut, and Anna's eyes widen as she quickly grabs a nearby cloth to apply pressure, her mind racing with thoughts of how this might have happened, and what it could mean for her already precarious situation."
"Anna scowls at him, and with the circle of people watching, crouches down, setting","two fingers on his leg. She immediately jerks her arm back. “Wow, it’s hot.”",28,"the small, delicate music box on the ground in front of her. She opens it, and a soft, melancholic tune fills the air, drawing in the attention of everyone around them. The music seems to match the rhythm of the rain, and for a moment, the crowd is entranced, their faces tilted upwards, eyes closed, letting the sweet notes wash over them. As the last notes fade away, Anna looks up at him, her eyes flashing with a mix of anger and sadness, and he can see the unspoken challenge in her gaze, daring him to make another move."
"Anna laughs. “Well, technically the twelfth, but the fifth was when he wrote me a song and got on his knees to","sing it to me, so that’s the night I see as our actual marriage.” She looks up at me, eyes soft. “He cried.”",45,"propose to me in front of a crowd of people at the local coffee shop. I was mortified, but also completely swept off my feet. It was such a romantic gesture, and the song was beautiful. I still get goosebumps thinking about it. He's always been the type to make grand gestures, and I have to admit, it's one of the things I love most about him. But, as I look back, I realize that it was also a bit of a warning sign. He's always been a bit of a dreamer, and sometimes his ideas don't quite match up with reality. Still, I wouldn't trade that moment for the world. It's a memory that I'll always treasure, and it's a big part of why I fell in love with him in the first place."
I’m out of town but will make sure my roommate is there to,"meet the courier. This is so exciting! The price sounds perfect.

"But because this is a Weston Party™, it doesn’t end there. Clustered down the center of each table are vases bursting with white orchids and sprays of spiky green palms. The plates are bone china, and they look old, rich old, vintage, with","about seventeen matching smaller plates and crystal champagne flutes at each place setting. I wonder idly if Janet had these brought over from her own collection, and then I realize she’d be more likely to just buy an entirely new set of priceless china.",87,"delicate gold filigree etched around the edges. The silverware is heavy, with a subtle sheen that hints at years of polishing. The glasses, too, are crystal, their facets glinting in the soft light that filters through the windows. The overall effect is one of understated opulence, as if the table settings alone are a testament to the wealth and refinement of the Weston family. As the guests take their seats, the room falls silent, awaiting the arrival of the host and hostess. The air is thick with anticipation, the scent of orchids and fresh flowers mingling with the faint tang of expensive perfume. The soft hum of conversation begins, a gentle murmur that builds in intensity as the guests await the start of the evening's festivities. Meanwhile, the staff moves with quiet efficiency, refilling glasses and adjusting the placement of the silverware with the precision of a well-oiled machine. It's clear that this is a party that will be remembered for a long time to come, a night of glamour and sophistication that will be etched in the memories of the guests forever."
"“So how’s it going with your dad?” I say, standing and stretching. West was pretty shaken up after Ray",blindsided him in front of the Forbes editor. I can’t imagine what it’s like wanting to avoid your own father.,39,"left, and I can tell he’s still trying to process everything. He looks up at me, his eyes squinting slightly as he thinks about how to answer. “It’s been tough,” he says finally, his voice low and rough. “I keep thinking about all the things I should have said to him, all the questions I should have asked.” He pauses, taking a deep breath before continuing. “But at the same time, I’m trying to focus on the good memories, you know? The times we had together, the things he taught me.” He looks away, his eyes welling up with tears, and I can tell he’s struggling to hold it together. I take a step closer to him, putting a hand on his shoulder in a gesture of support. “Hey, it’s okay,” I say softly. “You don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to.” But West shakes his head, taking another deep breath before looking back at me. “No, I need to talk about it,” he says, his voice firm. “I need to get it all out in the open.”"
“What I don’t understand is why he has such a boner for you being CEO when,you clearly don’t want the job. Let him give it to Alex. He clearly wants it.”,32,"it's clear that you're not even interested in the position. I mean, you've been saying for months that you're not ready for that level of responsibility, and yet he just won't take no for an answer. I've tried talking to him about it, but he just brushes me off, saying that you're the only one who can 'take the company to the next level.' I don't know what his obsession is with you being in charge, but it's starting to get really frustrating. Have you tried talking to him about it, or is he just as evasive with you as he is with me?"

It's a scary thought, but also kind of exhilarating, like the possibility of something amazing is just within reach. I've been trying to brush it off as mere fantasy, but the more I see them, the more I feel this inexplicable connection that I just can't shake off. It's like we're two magnets drawn to each other, and I'm not sure if I should be excited or terrified about what might happen if we finally give in to this attraction."
"Janet unfolds herself from her chair, floating like a vampire across to me, where she delivers a","kiss to the air on either side of my face. “Hello, darling. Nice of you to come.”",34,"low, husky whisper in my ear, her breath a cold caress that sends shivers down my spine as she utters a single, enigmatic word: ""Run."" I feel a jolt of adrenaline as her eyes lock onto mine, the intensity of her gaze making my heart skip a beat. The air around us seems to thicken, heavy with an unspoken warning, and I can sense the weight of her unspoken message settling upon me like a shroud. Suddenly, the room seems to darken, as if the shadows themselves are closing in, and I know that I must make a decision - to heed her warning, or to ignore it and risk everything."
"Reagan laughs down at her sand drawing. “Five more days,” she",says. “I’m having fun but I miss my dog and my friends.”,23,"says, her voice barely above a whisper, as she adds a few more lines to the crude calendar she's been keeping in the sand, a simple yet effective way to mark the passage of time since the accident that stranded her on this deserted island, the isolation and loneliness starting to take their toll on her mental and physical health, but she's determined to hold on to hope, to keep herself occupied and focused on the possibility of rescue, no matter how slim it may seem."
"He blinks away, aiming a wry laugh down at the sand before he looks back up again.","“Shots fired, okay.” He looks over at Reagan. “Then would my niece like to dance with me?”",34,"His eyes, a deep shade of brown that seems almost black in the fading light, sparkle with amusement as he takes a step closer to her, the sound of the waves gently lapping at the shore creating a soothing melody that seems to match the rhythm of her heartbeat. The air is filled with the sweet scent of saltwater and the cries of seagulls flying overhead, and for a moment, everything else fades into the background as they stand there, the tension between them palpable. He opens his mouth to say something, but the words seem to get caught in his throat, and all that comes out is a low, husky chuckle that sends shivers down her spine."
"“Should we go?” she asks, setting her hand over mine on her chest.",“This feels like the start of something we don’t want Ray to see.”,26,"Her eyes are wide with a mix of fear and anticipation, and I can feel her heart racing beneath my palm as she awaits my response. I take a deep breath, trying to weigh the pros and cons of our situation, but my mind is a jumbled mess of thoughts and emotions. The sound of distant sirens and the faint smell of smoke wafting through the air only add to our sense of urgency. I look around, trying to take in every detail of our surroundings, but the darkness seems to swallow everything whole. I squeeze her hand gently, trying to offer what little reassurance I can, and whisper, ""I think we have to try."" Her grip on my hand tightens, and I can sense her resolve strengthening. Together, we take a tentative step forward, the unknown looming before us like an abyss."
"“I was only fifteen when Grandpa died. We were all at the reading of the will, but you can imagine in a situation like that, especially for kids, a lot of the details sort of go over your head. The reading took hours. I understood,","basically, that he was leaving us each a very large sum of money. I understood that it was contingent on us being married. At the time, it didn’t seem so weird that he would want that. Kids sort of take those adult directives as law.”",90,"that Grandpa had left the majority of his estate to my parents, which wasn't a surprise, but what caught my attention was a small, peculiar clause that mentioned a mysterious key. It was to be given to me, and I was supposed to use it to unlock a door in the attic of our family's old Victorian home. I had always been fascinated by that attic, with its cobwebs and dusty trunks, but I had never been allowed to explore it. The lawyer's words sparked my curiosity, and I couldn't help but wonder what secrets the attic held. As the reading of the will came to a close, I felt a sense of excitement and trepidation. What could Grandpa have left for me, and why was it so important that it was hidden away in the attic? I glanced over at my parents, but they seemed just as puzzled as I was. My siblings, on the other hand, were too young to care about the intricacies of the will; they were more interested in the prospect of getting some of Grandpa's old toys. As we left the lawyer's office, I couldn't shake off the feeling that my life was about to change in ways I couldn't yet imagine. The mysterious key weighed heavily in my pocket, a constant reminder of the secrets that lay hidden in the attic, waiting to be uncovered."
"“Really.” I turn my face to the sun and feel its warmth spread through me. Residual panic drains away and I feel only contentment. I have money from West, I have the","start of a potential—maybe, let’s hope—career as an artist. I might be falling in… I cut the thought off. “Mel just called me. Tell Dad I can cover it, absolutely no problem.”",64,"car, and I have the open road. I take a deep breath, feeling the cool breeze fill my lungs, and let my eyes drift closed. The sound of birds chirping and leaves rustling in the trees creates a soothing melody that seems to wash away all my worries. I think about West and the way he smiled at me when he handed me the cash, his eyes crinkling at the corners. I think about the way he said ""you're going to be okay"" and how, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel like I might be. I think about the long stretch of highway ahead of me, full of possibilities and unknowns, and I feel a thrill of excitement. I have no particular destination in mind, no plan or agenda, and for once, that feels liberating. I can go wherever I want, do whatever I want, and the thought is exhilarating. As I stand there, basking in the warmth of the sun and the freedom of the open road, I feel a sense of peace settle over me, a sense of contentment that I haven't felt in a long, long time."
"The sound of a fork dropping onto porcelain breaks through my trance, and I blink over",to where Ray is now impatiently wiping his mouth on a napkin. “They just canceled now?”,32,"at the concerned face of my best friend, Rachel, who's sitting across from me at the small café. Her eyes, a deep shade of brown that always seem to hold a thousand questions, are narrowed slightly as she waits for my response to whatever it was she just said. I force a weak smile, feeling a twinge of guilt for zoning out in the middle of our conversation. The sound of the fork still echoes in my mind, a stark contrast to the soft hum of chatter and clinking dishes that fills the café. I take a deep breath, trying to shake off the haze that's been following me all day, and focus on Rachel's expectant expression. ""I'm sorry, what were you saying?"" I ask, hoping she'll repeat herself and I can pretend I was paying attention all along."
