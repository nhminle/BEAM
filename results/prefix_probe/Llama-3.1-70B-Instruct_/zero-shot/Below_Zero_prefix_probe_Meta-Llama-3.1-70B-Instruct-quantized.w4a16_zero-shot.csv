"Aside from Eager Beaver, there are fourteen of us starting today. Fourteen of us fresh out of top-five graduate programs, and prestigious internships, and CV-beefing industry","jobs accepted exclusively to look more attractive during NASA’s next round of recruitment. There’re fourteen of us, and the thirteen that aren’t me are all nodding enthusiastically.",53,"experiences, all gathered in this conference room, eager to make our mark on the world. We're the crème de la crème, the best of the best, and we know it. Our eyes are fixed on the prize, and we're ready to put in the long hours, the hard work, and the dedication required to reach the top. The air is electric with anticipation as we wait for the CEO to take the stage and outline our mission. We're a team of high-achievers, and we're ready to take on whatever challenges come our way. The question on everyone's mind is, what will be the first hurdle we need to overcome? Will it be a difficult project, a tough client, or something entirely unexpected? Whatever it is, we're ready to face it head-on, as a team, and come out on top."
"The truth, though, is quite the opposite. I hated school at first sight—with the direct consequence that school hated the sullen, listless child that I was right back. In the first grade, I refused to learn how to write my name, even though Hannah is only three letters repeated twice. In junior high, I set a school record for the highest number of consecutive detention days—what happens when","you decide to take a stand and not do homework for any of your classes because they are too boring, too difficult, too useless, or all of the above. Until the end of my sophomore year, I couldn’t wait to graduate and leave all of school behind: the books, the teachers, the grades, the cliques. Everything. I didn’t really have a plan for after, except for leaving now behind.",137,"you're a teenager with a bad attitude and a penchant for talking back to teachers. I was a master of finding creative ways to get out of doing my homework, and my grades suffered as a result. But despite my struggles in school, I found solace in reading and writing. I devoured books of all kinds, from science fiction to romance novels, and I spent hours scribbling in my journal, pouring out my thoughts and feelings onto the page. It wasn't until I stumbled upon a creative writing class in high school that I finally found my passion. For the first time, I felt like I was doing something that truly mattered to me, something that allowed me to express myself in a way that felt authentic. I began to see that writing wasn't just a chore, but a way to tap into my imagination and bring my ideas to life. As I delved deeper into the world of creative writing, I started to realize that my struggles in school had actually been a blessing in disguise. They had forced me to find alternative ways to learn and express myself, and had ultimately led me to discover my true passion. I began to see that success isn't just about getting good grades or following the traditional path, but about finding what truly sets your soul on fire and pursuing it with reckless abandon. And for me, that thing was writing."
"“It’s like space is your whole personality,” the girl I casually hooked up with during most of my sophomore year of undergrad told me. It was after I explained that no, thank you, I wasn’t interested in going out for coffee to meet her friends because of a lecture on","Kalpana Chawla I was planning to attend. “Do you have any other interests?” she asked. I threw her a quick “Nope,” waved good-bye, and wasn’t too surprised when, the following week, she didn’t reply to my offer to meet up. After all, I clearly couldn’t give her what she wanted.",100,"the societal implications of astrological signs on relationships. She laughed and said, ""You're so extra, always talking about the stars and planets like they're people."" I shrugged, not really understanding what she meant. To me, the stars and planets were people – or at least, they were a part of me. My grandmother used to tell me stories about how the constellations were our ancestors, guiding us through the darkness. I never really believed her, but there was something comforting about the idea."
"“Yeah, I’m not sure.” She shrugs and continues to make her way through a Tupperware of broccoli, an apple, and approximately two fucktons of Cheez-Its. “I don’t really know much about him. His parents divorced, then people in my family had arguments and stopped talking to each other. There was a lot of","prime Floyd dysfunction happening, so I haven’t actually spoken to him in years. But I heard from one of my other cousins that he was working on that thing that landed on Mars back when we were in high school. It was called something like . . . Contingency, or Carpentry, or Crudity—”",106," drama and tension, and I think that's why I never really got to know him that well. I mean, I've seen him at family gatherings and stuff, but we never really talked about anything deep. He always seemed kind of... distant, I guess. Like he was observing everything from the outside, but not really participating. I've heard rumors that he's been through some tough times, but I don't know if that's true. My mom says he's a good person, but she's always been a bit of a peacemaker, you know? She tries to see the best in everyone, even when they're being kind of crappy. Anyway, I'm sure he's fine. I mean, he's a grown man, right? He can take care of himself. Still, it's weird to think about him being back in town. I wonder what he's going to be like now. Is he still all brooding and intense, or has he mellowed out a bit? I guess I'll just have to wait and see. Maybe I'll run into him around town or something. Who knows, maybe we'll even become friends or something. Ha! Yeah, right. I wouldn't count on it. "
"“I think so. Do the dates add up? Maybe it was some kind of summer internship? But honestly, it might just be Floyd family lore. I have an aunt who insists that we’re related to","the Finnish royals, and according to Wikipedia there are no Finnish royals. So.” She shrugs and pops another handful of Cheez-Its in her mouth. “Would you like me to ask around, though? For the assignment?”",70,"Benjamin Franklin, but I've never been able to verify that claim. Anyway, I'm pretty sure my grandfather worked at the lab during the war, and he used to tell us stories about the scientists who worked there. He said they were all geniuses, but a bit eccentric. I remember him talking about one scientist in particular who was working on a top-secret project. He never told us what it was, but he said it was going to change the world. I've always been fascinated by those stories and I've tried to learn more about the lab's history, but it's not easy to find information. I've heard rumors that the lab was involved in some pretty classified research, and that's why so much of its history is still shrouded in secrecy. Despite the mystery surrounding it, I feel a strong connection to the lab and I'm determined to uncover more about its past and my family's role in it."
"“By the way, I sent you my cousin-or-something’s contact info a while ago,” Mara tells me one night. We’re at the",cheapest grad bar we’ve been able to find. She’s on her second Midori sour of the night. “Did you get it?”,42,"local diner, sipping coffee and discussing our plans for the upcoming summer. I rack my brain, trying to remember who Mara's cousin is and why I would need their contact information. ""Who's that again?"" I ask, taking a sip of my coffee. Mara rolls her eyes good-naturedly. ""You're kidding, right? I told you all about him. He's my mom's sister's son, so I guess that makes him my first cousin once removed or something. Anyway, his name is Alex, and he's a total genius when it comes to fixing cars. I thought you might need his help with your old clunker."" I nod, vaguely remembering Mara mentioning someone named Alex in passing. ""Oh yeah, I think I remember now. You said he was going to school to be a mechanic or something?"" Mara nods enthusiastically. ""That's the one. He's actually graduating at the top of his class and is looking for a job. I was thinking maybe you could hook him up with your dad or something."" I raise an eyebrow, intrigued by the idea. ""That's not a bad idea, actually. My dad is always looking for talented young mechanics to work at the shop. I'll have to give Alex a call and set something up."" Mara grins, satisfied that she's been able to help. ""I knew you two would get along. I'll send you his number again, just in case you lost it."" I smile, feeling grateful for Mara's thoughtful gesture. ""Thanks, Mara. You're a lifesaver."""
"He frowns, as if momentarily blanking on Mara’s name. “Ah, yes.” He nods. Only once. “Apparently,” he adds, which makes me laugh. He waits for me to take a seat","across from him before folding back in his chair. I notice that he doesn’t hold out his hand, nor does he smile. Interesting. “Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.”",61,"before continuing, his eyes drifting to the small, leather-bound book lying open on the table between us. The pages are yellowed and crackling, filled with handwritten notes in a language I don't recognize. He follows my gaze and smiles wryly, his eyes crinkling at the corners. ""Just a little something I've been working on,"" he says, his tone dismissive, but his eyes betraying a spark of excitement. I raise an eyebrow, intrigued despite myself, and he leans forward, his elbows on his knees. ""You see, I've been studying the ancient lore of our people,"" he begins, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone, ""and I think I may have stumbled upon something incredible."" He pauses, studying me intently, as if gauging my reaction. I lean forward, my curiosity piqued, and he launches into a passionate explanation of his theories, his words spilling out in a rush. As I listen, I find myself becoming increasingly entranced, my initial skepticism giving way to a growing sense of wonder."
"“Officially: unclear. But I’m fairly sure my brother made CDs of it. Sent them to local TV stations and whatnot.” He gestures vaguely, and his forearm is dusted with freckles and pale-red hair. I want to grab his wrist, hold it in front","of my eyes, study it at my leisure. Trace, smell, touch. “I haven’t spent a holiday with the Floyd side of the family in twenty years, but I’m told that the video is a source of great entertainment for all age groups at Thanksgiving.”",87,"of my face, and examine it more closely. The way the freckles cluster together, like constellations on a star chart, is identical to the pattern on my own arm. It's a small, silly thing, but it makes me feel a pang of connection to this stranger, this brother I barely know. I look up at him, and he's watching me with a curious expression, as if he's trying to read my thoughts. ""You okay?"" he asks, and I nod, feeling a little self-conscious. ""Yeah, I'm fine. Just...it's just weird, you know?"" He nods sympathetically, and we sit there in silence for a moment, the only sound the hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen. Then, he speaks up again, his voice a little softer. ""I think I might have some of those CDs around here somewhere. If you want, I can try to dig them up."" I nod eagerly, feeling a spark of excitement. ""Yeah, that would be great. I'd love to see them."" He smiles, and pushes himself up from the couch, his joints creaking slightly as he stands. ""Okay, let me go take a look."" He disappears into the back room, leaving me alone in the dimly lit living room. I take a deep breath, feeling a sense of trepidation mixed with anticipation. What will I find on those CDs? And what will it mean for me, for my family, for our strange and complicated history?"
"The section is in C++. Which happens to be the very first language I taught myself back in high school, when every single Google search for “Skills + Necessary + NASA” led to the sad result of “Programming.” Python came after. Then SQL. Then HAL/S. For each language, I started out convinced that chewing on","glass would surely be preferable. Then, at some point along the way, I began thinking in terms of functions, variables, conditional loops. A little after that, reading code became a bit like inspecting the label on the back of the conditioner bottle while showering: not particularly fun, but overall easy. I do have some talents, apparently.",111,"the syntax and semantics would be enough to make me proficient. I was wrong every time. It wasn't until I started working on actual projects, applying the concepts I had learned to real-world problems, that I began to feel like I truly understood the languages. And even then, there was always more to learn. I remember spending hours poring over lines of code, trying to debug a particularly stubborn issue, only to realize that the solution was something simple that I had overlooked. It was a humbling experience, but it taught me the value of perseverance and attention to detail. As I continued to learn and grow as a programmer, I began to appreciate the unique strengths and weaknesses of each language. I learned to choose the right tool for the job, and to adapt my approach to suit the specific needs of each project. And through it all, I developed a deep respect for the complexity and beauty of programming, and a passion for the endless possibilities that it offers. Looking back, I'm grateful for that initial search result that led me to programming, and for the journey that it set me on. It's a journey that I'm still on today, and one that I'm excited to see where it will take me next."
"My heart rate picks up. Warmth twists in my lower stomach. I lean forward with a smile, feeling like I’m finally in my element. This, this, is what I know best. Depending on how busy I am with school, or work, or binge-watching K-dramas,","I do this about once a week.

Time becomes irrelevant, and all that matters is the symphony of art unfolding before me. The world outside fades away, and I am one with my imagination, free to explore the depths of my creativity. As I delve deeper into my art, I feel an overwhelming sense of calm wash over me, a sense of being exactly where I am meant to be. The world may be chaotic, but in this moment, all is right with the world. My brush strokes become more confident, my colors more vibrant, and my passion more palpable. I am in my happy place, where nothing else matters but the art, and I am one with the creative universe."
"It sends me right over the edge. Into something that’s nothing like my usual, run-of-the-mill orgasm. Those tend to start like small fractures and then slowly, gradually deepen into something lovely and relaxing. Those are fun, good fun, but this . . . This pleasure is sudden and violent. It splinters into me like a wonderful, terrible explosion, new and frightening and fantastic,","and it goes on and on, as though every heart-stopping, delicious second of it is being squeezed out of me.

I crave it like a starving person craves food, like a parched traveler craves water. It's a hunger that gnaws at my very soul, a hunger that can't be satiated by anything else. And yet, even as I'm consumed by this maelstrom of pleasure, I know that I'm not alone. There's someone else out there, someone who's experiencing this same torrent of emotions, this same cataclysmic release. Someone who's connected to me on a deep, primal level, someone who's speaking to me in a language that only we can understand. The thought sends shivers down my spine, makes my heart skip a beat. I feel like I'm standing on the edge of a precipice, staring into the abyss, and I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to turn back."

I replay our conversation in my head, wondering if I misread the signs or if he was just being friendly. As I stand there, lost in thought, the sounds of the party fade into the background, and all I can think about is the what-ifs. What if I had said something more? What if I had asked for his number? What if I had taken a chance? The questions swirl in my head, leaving me with a sense of longing and uncertainty."
"The following day, when Mara asks me about my meeting with her cousin-or-something, I say only “Uneventful,” and I don’t even know why.

But it’s hard to shake the feeling that I’ve just made a mistake, that I should have been more honest with Mara. As we continue to talk, I find myself wondering what she would say if I told her the truth - would she be angry, or would she understand? And what does it say about our relationship that I’m not sure? The uncertainty lingers in my mind, a nagging feeling that I try to ignore as we spend the rest of the day together."

I wait for what feels like an eternity for a response, my ears straining to pick up any sound through the static-filled silence. Suddenly, a faint voice crackles through the speaker, and my heart skips a beat as I hear the words I've been longing to hear: ""Help is on the way, hold tight."" I feel a surge of hope and relief wash over me, but it's short-lived as the voice continues, ""However, we're facing unforeseen challenges, and it may take longer than expected. Can you give us an update on your status and any changes in the environment?""

The sound of her laughter, the way she used to tease me mercilessly, and the adventures we had in the woods behind our grandparents' house all come flooding back, making it difficult for me to focus on the present moment. I force myself to tune back in, trying to pick up where the conversation left off, but my mind keeps wandering, wondering what Mara is like now and if she ever thinks about me too."

But Mara's always been driven and focused, so it's no surprise she's doing so well. I make a mental note to reach out to her soon and catch up – it's been too long since we last spoke. As I continue to scroll through social media, I come across a post from another friend, announcing the arrival of her new baby. I smile and leave a congratulatory comment, feeling happy for her and her growing family.

"It is. AMASE is the shit, and the selection process to take part in an expedition was brutal, to the point that I’m not quite sure how I made it in. Probably sheer luck: Dr. Merel, one of the expedition leaders, was looking","for someone with experience in gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry.

In hindsight, I feel a bit guilty.",86,"for someone with a background in astrobiology, and I happened to be in the right place at the right time. I remember the interview process like it was yesterday - a grueling series of questions that tested my knowledge, skills, and experience. But I guess I must have said something right, because a few weeks later, I received an email inviting me to join the AMASE team. I was ecstatic, to say the least. The opportunity to be part of a team that was pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and exploration was a dream come true. As I delved deeper into the world of astrobiology, I began to realize the significance of the research we were conducting. We were not just searching for signs of life on Mars; we were also learning about the origins of life on Earth and the potential for life elsewhere in the universe. The experience was both humbling and exhilarating, and I felt grateful to be a part of it. The days that followed were a whirlwind of activity - training sessions, equipment checks, and last-minute preparations before our departure. And then, before I knew it, we were on our way to Svalbard, a remote archipelago in the Arctic Circle that would serve as our base camp for the expedition. The landscape was breathtaking - vast expanses of ice and snow stretched out as far as the eye could see, punctuated by jagged peaks and glaciers that shimmered like diamonds in the sunlight. It was a truly alien landscape, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the sheer beauty of it all. As we settled into our routine, I began to appreciate the complexity and sophistication of the AMASE operation. The team was made up of experts from all over the world, each with their own unique skills and expertise. There were geologists, biologists, physicists, and engineers, all working together towards a common goal. The sense of camaraderie was palpable, and I felt proud to be a part of such a talented and dedicated team. And then, of course, there was the research itself - the reason we were all here in the first place. We spent our days collecting samples, conducting experiments, and analyzing data, all in an effort to better understand the Martian environment and the potential for life on the Red Planet. It was painstaking work, to be sure, but also incredibly rewarding. As I looked out at the Arctic landscape, I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder at the mysteries that still lay hidden, waiting to be uncovered. And I knew that I was exactly where I was meant to be - on the cutting edge of scientific discovery, surrounded by some of the brightest minds on the planet."

"As we all know, in early 2010, the rover Spirit became stuck in a sand trap, was unable to reorient its solar panels toward the sun, and froze to death as a consequence of its lack of power. Something very similar happened eight years later to Opportunity, which went into hibernation when a maelstrom blocked sunlight and prevented it from recharging its","batteries. Obviously, the risk of losing control of rovers because of extreme weather events is high. To address this, Dr. Arroyo has designed a promising internal system that is less likely to fail in the case of unpredictable meteorological situations. She proposes to build a model and test its efficacy on the next expedition at the Arctic Mars Analog in Svalbard (AMASE)—",124,"batteries. Although the mission team made numerous attempts to revive Opportunity, it was ultimately declared lost in February 2019. The loss of these two rovers highlights the challenges and risks associated with space exploration, particularly when it comes to the harsh Martian environment. The Martian surface is known for its extreme temperatures, low air pressure, and frequent dust storms, all of which can pose significant threats to the survival of robotic missions. Despite these challenges, NASA and other space agencies continue to send rovers and landers to Mars, driven by the desire to explore the planet's surface and uncover its secrets. The Curiosity rover, which has been operating on Mars since 2012, has made numerous groundbreaking discoveries, including the detection of ancient lakes and organic molecules. The Perseverance rover, launched in 2020, is currently exploring Jezero crater and has already provided valuable insights into the Martian geology and climate. As technology advances and new missions are planned, scientists and engineers are working to develop more resilient and adaptable rovers that can withstand the harsh conditions on Mars and continue to expand our knowledge of the Red Planet."
"Dr. Arroyo’s project is a brilliant addition to NASA’s current roster, and it should be approved for further","study. Dr. Arroyo’s vitae is impressive, and she has accumulated enough experience to carry out the proposed work—",36,"development and implementation. The potential breakthroughs that could arise from this research are vast and could greatly benefit not only the field of space exploration but also various aspects of our daily lives. By investing in Dr. Arroyo's project, NASA would be taking a significant step forward in advancing our understanding of the universe and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. Furthermore, the project's focus on innovative technologies and methodologies could lead to the development of new tools and techniques that could be applied to a wide range of fields, from medicine to environmental science. It is essential that NASA provides the necessary resources and support to bring this project to fruition, as the potential rewards are well worth the investment. With Dr. Arroyo at the helm, this project is sure to make a lasting impact and contribute significantly to the advancement of scientific discovery."
"I met Dr. Merel because he was my direct superior during AMASE, and he is . . . an odd duck, honestly. Very stiff. Very hard-core. NASA is full of ambitious people, but he seems to be almost obsessed with results, publications, the kind of sexy science that makes","big splashy news.

I remember one time, we were in the middle of a simulation, and he just stopped everything and started lecturing us on the importance of publishing in high-impact journals. I mean, I get it, it's crucial for a career in science, but it was just so... intense. And yet, despite his tough exterior, he has this dry sense of humor that catches you off guard. I recall him making a witty remark about the absurdity of our situation, and it completely broke the tension. It was like he had this hidden side that only came out when you least expected it. As I got to know him better, I realized that his intensity was actually a result of his passion for the work, and that he genuinely cared about the people he worked with. He was always pushing us to be our best, even if it meant being a bit unorthodox in his methods. Despite the initial culture shock, I grew to respect and admire him, and I think he played a significant role in shaping my own approach to research. His influence still resonates with me today, and I often find myself thinking, ""What would Dr. Merel do in this situation?"""

It's not worth the risk of commingling them with your other assets, especially considering the current market volatility. I know it may seem like a hassle, but trust me, it's for the best. Now, let's move on to the next item on the agenda. I have some good news regarding the Johnson account. It looks like they're willing to sign the contract by the end of the week, which is a huge win for us. I'll send over the revised contract for your review, but I think we're in good shape. What are your thoughts on the marketing strategy for the new product launch? Should we stick with the original plan or explore some alternative options?"
"“I’ll be there, out in the field with you, of course,” Dr. Merel says. I’m a little surprised. In the months we were in Norway, I saw him do very little sample","collecting and snow plodding. I’ve always thought of him as more of a coordinator. But if he offered, he must mean it, and . . . I smile. “Perfect, then. Thank you.”",64,"collection himself, and I had assumed he would be staying behind in the lab to analyze the data we'd collected so far. But I'm glad to have him along - his expertise will undoubtedly be invaluable in the field. As we make our way to the site, the sun beats down on us, and I can feel the weight of our equipment digging into my shoulders. Dr. Merel, however, seems undeterred, his eyes shining with excitement behind his wire-rimmed glasses. ""This is it, the moment we've been waiting for,"" he says, his voice barely above a whisper. ""We're on the cusp of something big here, I can feel it."" I nod in agreement, my own excitement growing with every step. We've been searching for this site for months, pouring over maps and satellite images, and finally, we've found it. The air is electric with anticipation as we begin to set up our equipment, the sound of birds chirping and leaves rustling in the wind the only signs of life in this desolate landscape. As we work, I catch glimpses of Dr. Merel's face, his eyes fixed intently on the task at hand, his brow furrowed in concentration. I know that look - it's the same one he wore when we were working in the lab, pouring over samples and data. It's a look of complete and utter focus, a look that says he's exactly where he's meant to be. And as I glance around at the vast expanse of wilderness stretching out before us, I know that I'm exactly where I'm meant to be too."
"The problems start when he looks up and notices me. He stops exactly two steps below, which should put him at a disadvantage but, depressingly, unfairly, tragically, doesn’t. We are at eye level when his","eyes widen and his lips curve in a pleased smile. He says, “Hannah,” a touch of something in his voice that I recognize but instantly reject, and I have no choice but to acknowledge him.",70,"eyes lock onto mine, and I can see the faintest glimmer of recognition. It's as if he's trying to place me, to figure out where we've met before. I can almost see the gears turning in his head as he scans my face, his eyes narrowing slightly as he searches for a connection. The air is thick with tension as we stand there, frozen in a silent standoff. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest, my palms growing sweaty as I wait for him to make his move. And then, just as suddenly as it started, the moment is over. He blinks, and his expression changes, his face smoothing out into a mask of polite indifference. ""Can I help you?"" he asks, his voice low and even, and I'm left feeling like I've imagined the whole thing. But I know what I saw, and I know that I'm not crazy. There's something between us, something that goes beyond a simple chance encounter. I just have to figure out what it is."
"He doesn’t deny it, doesn’t defend himself, doesn’t scream that I’m insane. His","eyes narrow to blue slits and he asks, “It was Merel, wasn’t it?”",26,"eyes lock onto mine, a deep sadness and understanding reflected in them, as if he's been waiting for this moment, for me to finally see the truth that he's been hiding for so long. The air is thick with tension, heavy with the weight of unspoken words, as we stand there, frozen in a moment of mutual understanding, the only sound the soft hum of the city outside, a stark contrast to the turmoil brewing inside me."
"“Because he was there when I explained my objections, at length and in detail. Did he omit that?” I press my lips together. Which he seems to interpret as an opening. “Hannah.” He leans closer. We’re nose to nose, I smell his skin and his aftershave, and I hate every second of this. “Your","project is too dangerous. It specifically asks that you travel to a remote location to drop off equipment at a time of the year in which the weather is volatile and often totally unpredictable. I’ve been in Longyearbyen in February, and avalanches develop out of the blue. It’s only gotten worse in the last few—”",109,"objections are duly noted, but I'm afraid they're irrelevant at this point. We've been over this, Hannah. The decision has been made, and it's final. I'm not sure what else you want me to say."" His voice is low and even, but I can sense the underlying tension. I feel a surge of frustration and anger, but I'm determined to keep my cool. I take a deep breath and try to reason with him. ""Irrelevant? You call my concerns irrelevant? You're the one who's being obstinate and refusing to listen."" I pause, studying his expression. ""What's going on, Alex? What's really going on here?"" I ask, my voice barely above a whisper. His eyes flicker, and for a moment, I think I see a glimmer of uncertainty. But then his mask slips back into place, and he's once again the calm, collected person I've come to know. ""Nothing's going on, Hannah. Just business as usual. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a meeting to get to."" He turns to leave, but I catch his arm, my grip tight. ""Don't walk away from me, Alex. Not now. Not when we're in the middle of this conversation."" He looks down at my hand, then back at me, his eyes narrowing. ""Let go, Hannah."" His voice is cold, detached. I feel a shiver run down my spine, but I refuse to back down. I hold his gaze, my heart pounding in my chest. ""No,"" I say, my voice firm. ""I won't let go until you tell me the truth."""
"I cling to him. He lets me sob for long moments we cannot afford, pressing me against him with no air between us, until I can feel his heartbeat through the thick layers","of our clothes. Then he mumbles “Fucking Merel” with barely restrained fury, and I think that it would be so easy to blame things on Merel, but the truth is, it’s all my fault.",67,"of his coat. I breathe in the smell of leather and sweat, a scent that's uniquely his, and it calms me enough to slow my tears. He holds me like that, silently, until I'm able to pull back and look up at him. His eyes are soft, filled with a deep concern that makes my throat tighten again. I force a weak smile, trying to reassure him without words. He nods, understanding, and gently brushes a strand of hair behind my ear. The touch sends a shiver down my spine, but it's a comforting one, reminding me that I'm not alone in this. We stand there for a moment, the only sound the quiet hum of the city around us, a stark contrast to the turmoil inside. Then, without a word, he takes my hand, and we move forward, into the unknown, together."
"“Who is M— Oh. Yeah. For the most part. Mom isn’t very fond of the Floyd side of the family. Though I’m sure he’s the black sheep by their standards, too.","I wasn’t really allowed to spend time with him, so . . .” He shakes his head, as if to change the topic. “Here. It’s not much, but you should eat.”",62,"She always says that they're a bit too... eccentric for her taste. I've only met them a handful of times, but from what I've seen, they do seem to be a pretty... lively bunch. I mean, my great-aunt Mildred is always talking about her latest conspiracy theories, and my great-uncle Bob has this weird habit of collecting antique door knobs. But hey, at least they're interesting, right? Anyway, I'm sure Mom just doesn't want me to get too caught up in their... unconventional lifestyle. She's always been a bit of a worrier, and I'm sure she just wants what's best for me. Still, it's hard not to feel a little drawn to the Floyd side of the family. They're just so... unpredictable. You never know what's going to happen when you're around them. And I have to admit, it's kind of exciting. Maybe that's why I've always felt a little like I don't quite fit in with Mom's side of the family. They're all so... normal. So boring. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love them and all, but sometimes I just wish they'd loosen up a bit. You know, be a little more... Floyd-like."
"“No, no, shh.” His arms tighten around me, and I realize that I am, in","fact, crying. “You are not an asshole, Hannah. And you are the opposite of incompetent.”",30,"fact, being held by him, my face pressed into the warmth of his chest. The sound of his heartbeat is soothing, and I feel my eyelids growing heavy as I breathe in the scent of his skin. It's a smell that's both familiar and comforting, like coming home after a long time away. I try to remember the last time I felt this safe, this protected, but my mind is a jumble of emotions and memories. All I know is that I don't want to move, don't want to break the spell that's been cast over me. His arms hold me close, and I feel like I'm melting into him, becoming a part of him. It's a feeling that's both exhilarating and terrifying, like standing on the edge of a cliff, staring into the unknown."
"“Because of the intrinsic danger of a project like yours. For the past few months, I tried to get this project stopped in about ten different ways. Personal meetings, emails, appeals—I","tried it all. And even the people who agreed with me that it was too dangerous would not step in to prevent it. So no, you’re not the asshole, Hannah. They are.”",63,"even went so far as to contact a few influential people in the industry, hoping they could use their leverage to put a halt to it. But every door I tried to open led to a dead end, and every conversation I had ended in a brick wall. It's as if the project has a life of its own, and nothing can stop it from moving forward. I've seen projects like this before, and I know how they usually end - in disaster. That's why I'm here today, to make one final appeal to you, to reconsider and shut this project down before it's too late. I know it won't be easy, and I know there will be consequences, but I truly believe it's the only way to avoid a catastrophe. I've brought some documents with me, which I think will illustrate my point and show you the potential risks involved. If you're willing to listen, I'd be happy to go through them with you."
"“Oh.” I swallow. “Merel was supposed to come for backup. But he wasn’t feeling well. I offered to wait for him, but he said we’d be losing valuable days of data and that I should just go","alone, and I . . .” I squeeze my fingers around the material of Ian’s shirt. “I went. And then, when I called in for help, he told me that the weather was turning, and . . .”",75,"ahead without him. I didn't think much of it at the time, but now I'm starting to wonder if something was off. I mean, Merel's always been a bit of a worrier, but he's also a total pro. If he said he wasn't feeling well, there must have been a good reason for it. I make a mental note to check in with him as soon as I can, see if everything's okay. But for now, I've got to focus on the task at hand. I take a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of unease that's settled in the pit of my stomach. I've been in tougher spots than this before, and I've always managed to come out on top. I can do this. I just need to stay calm, stay focused, and get the job done. I glance around the room, taking in the rows of humming machinery and the soft glow of the computer screens. It's quiet, too quiet, and I can feel the weight of the silence pressing down on me. I know I'm not alone in here, but it feels like it. I feel like I'm the only one who knows what's really going on. And that's a scary thought."
"He shrugs. “I figured you might want to talk through your near-death experience with someone, so",I decided to tell Mara what happened. I did not expect her to come in person.”,32,"I'm here to listen,"" he says, his voice low and soothing, as he leans back in his chair and steeples his fingers together, his eyes locked intently on yours, waiting for you to begin. The dim lighting in the room seems to fade into the background as you take a deep breath, the memories of the accident still fresh in your mind, and you start to recount the events leading up to the crash, your voice shaking slightly as you relive the moment when your car skidded off the road. He listens attentively, his expression a mask of calm concern, as you struggle to put into words the emotions that have been swirling inside you since the accident, and you find yourself opening up to him in ways you never thought possible."
"“I was going to. Once I felt less whiny. And—whatever.” I roll my eyes. Wow,",I’m mature. “How did you go from not remembering Mara’s name to having her number?”,30,"great, now I'm having a conversation with myself. I shake my head and take a deep breath, trying to clear my thoughts. I need to focus on the task at hand, not get caught up in my own emotions. I glance around the room, taking in the familiar surroundings. The worn couch, the old coffee table, the bookshelf filled with dog-eared paperbacks. It's a space that's seen its fair share of late-night conversations, study sessions, and lazy Sundays. I feel a pang of nostalgia wash over me, but I push it aside. I need to stay present. I take another deep breath and try to gather my thoughts, to figure out what I'm going to do next."
"“Well, still.” She shrugs. “I promise I don’t have anything against",you personally. I’m just not generally a fan of the Floyd family.”,23,"you, personally. It's just that I've been noticing some strange things around here lately, and I think it's time someone looked into it. I mean, have you seen anything unusual? Heard any weird noises at night? I know it sounds silly, but I have this feeling that something's off. And I'm not just talking about the usual creaks and groans of an old building. I'm talking about something more... deliberate. Do you know what I mean?"
"“Yes,” Mara agrees. “Are you going to break my blood relative’s heart?","Don’t get me wrong, I’d still side with you. Hos before bros.”",24,"“I don't know,” he says, his voice barely above a whisper, “but I do know that I have to try and make things right between us, no matter how difficult it may be, because the thought of losing you is unbearable, and I fear that if I don't act now, I might just lose my chance at true happiness with you, and that's a risk I'm not willing to take.”"
"“I guess we’ll see. I’m not sure he would want to date,” I say, staring at Sadie’s Froot Loops. The ensuing silence drags on so long,",I’m forced to look up. She and Mara are staring at me like I just announced that I’m quitting my job to take up macramé full-time. “What?”,53,"that I start to wonder if Sadie has dozed off with her eyes open. But then she speaks up, her voice low and thoughtful. ""You know, I think he might surprise you. He's been through a lot, and sometimes people need a little nudge to get back out there."" She pauses, studying me intently. ""But you have to be careful, too. You can't just push him into something he's not ready for. That's not fair to either of you."" I nod, taking her words to heart. I know she's right – I just hope I can find the right balance between being supportive and giving him space. As I ponder this, Sadie pushes her cereal aside and stands up, stretching her arms over her head. ""I'm going to go for a walk,"" she says. ""Want to come with?"" I hesitate, unsure if I'm in the mood for a walk, but Sadie's expression is persuasive. ""Yeah, sure,"" I say finally, pushing my chair back. Together, we head out into the crisp morning air, the silence between us comfortable and familiar."
"“Considering that he saved your life, contacted Great-Aunt Delphina, and put up two dudes he’s never seen",before so their girlfriends could hang out with you . . . I think maybe he does.”,34,"before in his home, I think it's safe to say that he's earned the right to be a bit of a jerk. Besides, he's been through a lot himself, what with being a werewolf and all. I mean, can you imagine having to deal with that kind of secret? It's not exactly something you can share with just anyone. And yet, he's managed to keep it together, even when things get really tough. So, yeah, I think we can cut him some slack. After all, he's still the same person who risked his life to save mine, and that's something I'll never forget. I just hope that someday he'll be able to find some peace and learn to control his transformations. Until then, I'll be here for him, no matter what."
"“Actually, they fixed the elevator. And this new cast is easy to walk on. So, no need. But you . . .” You can","do this, Hannah. Come on. You just survived polar bears thanks to this guy. You can say the words. “You could come up anyway.”",48,"can't just stand there, you have to keep moving forward, even if it's just a small step at a time. I know it's hard, but you're stronger than you think. Remember when we first met, you were so full of life and energy? That spark is still in you, it's just been dimmed a bit. Let's work on reigniting it, okay? We can start with small things, like taking a walk around the block or trying a new restaurant. I'll be right there with you, every step of the way. We'll get through this together, I promise."
"“Right.” He sighs and bites into his lower lip. “Hannah, if that changes. If you ever find yourself able to believe that someone could care about you that much. And","if you wanted to actually . . . have dinner with that someone.” He lets out a laugh. “Well . . . Please, consider me. You know where to find me.”",61,"you're willing to take a chance on it, I'll be here. I'll be waiting for you, no matter how long it takes. I know it won't be easy, and I know you've been hurt before, but I'm willing to take that risk if it means being with you. You deserve to be loved, Hannah, and I want to be the one to give that to you. I want to be the one to show you that love doesn't have to be a source of pain, but a source of strength and comfort. I want to be the one to hold you when you're scared, to wipe away your tears when you cry, and to celebrate with you when you're happy. I want to be the one to love you, truly and deeply, for who you are, without condition or expectation. And I hope, someday, you'll be able to see that and take a chance on me."
“Hannah.” He gives me a skeptical look. “You have two friends who,dropped everything to be with you. And I assume sex wasn’t involved.”,24,"are currently in the hospital, and you're telling me you had nothing to do with it? I'm not buying it, Hannah. You're going to have to do a lot better than that if you want me to believe you're innocent. What really happened that night? Don't give me any of that 'I don't know what you're talking about' nonsense. I've seen the security footage, and I know you were at the scene. So, start talking."
"“Hannah.” He unbuckles his seat belt and angles himself toward me, so that I have no choice but to look him in the eyes. He looks earnest and nearly offended. “I have thought about what happened in my office every day for the past five years. You offered to go down on me, and I just . . . embarrassed myself, and it should be the most mortifying memory I have, but for some reason it’s turned into the axis every fantasy of mine spins around, and”—he reaches up to pinch the bridge of his nose—“I want to fuck you.","Obviously. Always have. I just don’t want to fuck you once. I want to do it a lot. For a long time. I want you to come to me for sex, but also want you to come to me when you need help with your taxes and moving your furniture. I want fucking to be only one of the million things I do for you, and I want to be—” He stops. Seems to collect himself and straightens, as if to give me space. To give us space. “I’m sorry. I don’t want to crowd you. You can . . .”",201,"His words hang in the air, and I feel my face heat up as I try to process what he's saying. I'm shocked, but at the same time, I'm not. I've thought about that moment too, wondered what would have happened if he had taken me up on my offer. I've replayed it in my head, imagined the way his hands would feel on my skin, the way his lips would taste."
"He laughs, low and beautiful and a little rueful. And after looking at me like no","one else ever has before, what he says is, “Yes, Hannah. It is a yes on dinner.”",33,"one has ever looked at me before, he turns away, his shoulders sagging in a way that makes me want to reach out and touch him, to comfort him, to tell him that everything will be okay. But I don't, because I'm not sure if it will be, and because I'm not sure if he would even want me to. So I just stand there, frozen in place, as he walks away from me, leaving me feeling lost and confused and more than a little scared. I watch him go, my eyes fixed on the back of his head, wondering what just happened, and what it means for us, for me, for everything. And then, just as I'm starting to think that I'll never see him again, he stops, and turns around, and looks at me with eyes that are full of a deep and abiding sadness."
"“Um, I could make us a . . .” I scratch my head, studying the contents of my open fridge. Okay, so it’s full. The problem is, it’s full exclusively of stuff that needs to be cooked, chopped, baked, prepared. Stuff that’s healthy and doesn’t taste","particularly good. I am now 93 percent sure that Mara was the one who went shopping, because no one else would dare to impose broccoli on me. “How does one even . . . I could boil the broccoli, I guess? In a pot? With water?”",92,"like cardboard. I'm starting to think I should just order a pizza or something, but then I remember that I'm trying to be more responsible with my finances. I let out a deep sigh and try to think of something, anything, that I can whip up quickly. As I scan the shelves, my eyes land on a box of pasta, a jar of marinara sauce, and a bag of frozen vegetables. It's not the most exciting meal, but it'll do. I start to boil some water and heat up the sauce, feeling a sense of relief wash over me. At least I won't have to order takeout. As I wait for the pasta to cook, I start to think about my day. It's been a long one, filled with meetings and deadlines. I'm exhausted. All I want to do is curl up on the couch with a good book and a warm meal. I glance over at the clock and see that it's already getting late. I hope my dinner will be ready soon. Just as I'm starting to get impatient, the timer goes off, signaling that the pasta is done. I drain it and add it to the sauce, stirring in the frozen vegetables. It's not the most gourmet meal, but it smells delicious. I grab a plate and head to the living room, feeling grateful for the simple pleasures in life. As I take my first bite, I let out a contented sigh. It may not be the healthiest meal, but it's exactly what I needed after a long day. I settle in on the couch, feeling my eyes start to droop. It's going to be a good night."
“Hannah.” His forehead touches mine. He laughs against my mouth. “Dinner is . . . it’s symbolic. A,"metaphor. If you tell me that you’re willing to see where things go, I believe you, and we can—”",37,"reminder of the life we're trying to build together. A life where we can sit down, share a meal, and just be. His words are laced with a deep longing, and I can feel the weight of his emotions as he pulls back to look at me. His eyes are searching, hoping that I'll understand the significance of this simple act. I nod, and he smiles, his face relaxing into a warm, gentle curve. ""I know it's not much,"" he says, ""but I wanted to make it special. For you."" My heart swells at the thought, and I reach out to brush a strand of hair out of his face. ""It's perfect,"" I say, my voice barely above a whisper. He takes my hand, and we walk together into the quiet intimacy of the evening, the soft glow of the candles casting a warm light over everything."
"He is hot and huge. Closing his eyes, arching his neck before looking at me again with a half-warning, half-pleading expression. He finds me sitting","on his knees, his cock spasming in my grip as I lean over. “Hannah,” he says, even deeper than usual. “What are you . . .”",51,"on the edge of the bed, my feet dangling in the air as I stare at him with a mixture of fascination and trepidation. His eyes seem to burn with an inner fire, and I can feel the heat emanating from his body, making my skin prickle with sweat. He takes a step closer, his movements fluid and deliberate, and I can sense the tension building between us. The air is thick with unspoken words, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest as I wait for him to make his next move. His gaze never wavers, and I feel like he's trying to convey a message, but I'm not sure what it is. Suddenly, he reaches out a hand and gently brushes a strand of hair behind my ear, his touch sending shivers down my spine. I feel a jolt of electricity run through my body, and I'm not sure if it's fear or excitement that's driving my heart to beat faster."
“Or maybe it’s the Vastitas Borealis.” He’s barely intelligible. Doing those little thrusts that are designed more to open me up than to,"fuck me properly, and yet we’re both this close to orgasm. It’s a little scary. “The oceans that used to fill it, Hannah.”",46,"actually bring us closer together. I try to focus on the sensation, but my mind keeps drifting back to the conversation we had earlier. The one where he mentioned the possibility of us being the last two people on Mars. I push the thought away, not wanting to ruin the moment. But it's hard to shake off the feeling of desperation that's been building up inside me. We've been surviving on this barren planet for so long, and the isolation is starting to take its toll. I look up at him, and for a brief moment, our eyes lock. I see a glimmer of hope there, a spark that suggests we might just make it through this after all. But it's quickly extinguished, replaced by a look of determination. He's trying to make this work, to make us work, and I appreciate the effort. I try to reciprocate, to let go of my doubts and fears, and just be present in this moment. But it's not easy. The vastness of the Martian landscape stretches out before us, a constant reminder of our insignificance. And yet, in this moment, I feel a sense of connection to this man, to this planet, and to the unknown that lies ahead."
