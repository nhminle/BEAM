"“I think I’m all set here,” he says, and lol of course he isn’t going","to kiss me. “But if I forgot anything, you can have Jake come pick it up.”",31,"to admit it, but I can tell by the way he's fidgeting with his backpack straps that he's still got a few things on his mind. We're standing outside the dorm, and I can see the faint glow of the city lights reflecting off the wet pavement. It's been a long day, and I'm ready to call it a night, but I know he's not going to let me get away that easily. ""Hey, you sure you're good?"" I ask, trying to sound casual, but he just gives me a curt nod and starts walking away. I sigh and follow after him, my eyes scanning the deserted quad as we make our way back to our rooms. The night air is crisp and cool, filled with the scent of damp earth and new beginnings. I can feel the weight of the semester settling in around us, the pressure to perform and produce, but for now, at least, we're just two guys trying to make it through the night."
"Jake: younger brother to West (and only slightly less good-looking) and that type of college friend who knows everything about my life at UCLA but has never met my father, who lives only an hour away.","Jake introduced me to West; now Jake will be my sole remaining connection to West. The thought makes me a little sad, but then I remember I have the couch and T-virus zombies waiting for me inside.",73,"He's the kind of friend who knows my favorite coffee order, my go-to study spots, and the names of all my past relationships, but has never set foot in my childhood home or met the people who raised me. It's a strange dynamic, but one that I've grown accustomed to over the years. Despite the distance between our hometown and the university, Jake has become a constant presence in my life, always ready with advice or a listening ear whenever I need it. His easygoing nature and quick wit have a way of putting me at ease, even on my most stressful days. And although he may not know my family, he's become a part of my extended family in his own way, a connection that transcends blood ties and geography."
"“You, too.” West smiles that eye-crinkling smile again, and","damn, I really wish I’d seen it more. “Bye, Anna.”",19,"he leans in, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone as he says, ""I've been thinking, we should grab some dinner sometime, just the two of us, and catch up on old times."" His eyes sparkle with mischief, and for a moment, it's like no time has passed at all, and they're back to their old routine, swapping stories and laughter like they used to."
"I feel her attention move from the empty apartment to the side of my face, and when I smile","over at her, her blue eyes are round with worry. “Holy shit, Anna, I had no idea. Are you okay?”",39,"she smiles back, and for a moment, the emptiness of the apartment is filled with the warmth of our shared amusement. Her eyes sparkle with curiosity, and I can sense her trying to read between the lines, to understand what's behind my smile. I lean against the counter, my eyes never leaving hers, and begin to tell her the story of how I came to be standing in this empty apartment, with nothing but a suitcase by my side and a heart full of hope. As I speak, her expression changes from curiosity to surprise, and finally, to understanding, and I know that I've found a kindred spirit, someone who sees the beauty in the unknown and the freedom in starting anew."
"“That is wonderful news, sweetheart! Oh, I’m so thrilled! Why don’t you fly down to John Wayne the night","before, stay at the house, and we’ll all take the plane over together? The flight to Singapore is a bear.”",39,"before your birthday and we can celebrate together? I was thinking we could go out for dinner at that new restaurant you've been wanting to try, and then maybe catch a movie or a show. I'll make all the arrangements, just let me know what time your flight gets in. And don't forget to pack your favorite outfit, I want to see you looking your absolute best. I just can't wait to give you a big hug and hear all about everything that's been going on in your life. It feels like it's been ages since we've had a chance to spend some quality time together, just the two of us. I'm really looking forward to it, darling!"
"“Anna?” he says, like he’s not entirely sure, and then does a full top-to-bottom sweep of my body, which recalls the lack of pants.","When he digs his hand into his luscious head of hair, I forget to be embarrassed again, because it all comes back to me.",48,"His eyes widen slightly, and he takes a step back, his gaze lingering on my legs before he looks away, clearing his throat. ""I, uh, I didn't expect to see you like that,"" he says, his voice low and rough, and I can feel my face heat up with embarrassment. I try to play it cool, but my hands instinctively move to cover myself, which only makes me feel more ridiculous. ""I was just, uh, getting ready for bed,"" I say, trying to sound nonchalant, but my voice comes out high and awkward. He nods, still not looking at me, and takes another step back, his eyes fixed on some point behind me. ""I'll just, uh, go,"" he says, and turns to leave, but not before I catch a glimpse of a faint smile on his face."
The expression he makes is like the meme of that one kid who smiles and then immediately bursts into tears.,West is staring at me like he’s doomed but must pretend to be happy about it. “Anna. You look… great?”,40,"His face contorts in a mixture of emotions, as if he's trying to hold back laughter, but the absurdity of the situation is too much to bear, and he ends up with a goofy grin that's both endearing and ridiculous. It's a look that's equal parts adorable and pitiful, making it impossible not to laugh at the sheer ridiculousness of it all. The image of that meme kid is forever etched in our collective consciousness, and this guy's expression is like a real-life manifestation of that same emotional rollercoaster."
"Stepping aside, I let him pass, and he pulls up short at what’s on the television screen. Conan is",enthusiastically fucking a witch in a cave. We both clear our throats and look up at the ceiling instead.,38,"standing in front of a city skyline, microphone in hand, and a serious expression on his face. My roommate's eyes are glued to the screen as Conan begins to speak, his voice low and urgent. I can tell by the look on his face that something is wrong, and I feel a shiver run down my spine as I turn to listen. The words ""breaking news"" flash across the screen, and Conan's voice grows more serious, his words tumbling out in a rush. My roommate and I stand there, frozen, as the news sinks in, our minds struggling to process the enormity of what we're being told. The room around us fades away, and all that's left is the sound of Conan's voice, the city skyline behind him, and the weight of the news that's about to change everything."
"He adjusts his posture on the sofa, turning slightly to face me. Oh, right. He came here to","ask me for help. I sit up, too, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. Focus, Anna.",37,"talk to me about something, but I'm not sure what it could be. His eyes seem to be searching for the right words, and for a moment, we just sit there in silence. The sound of the TV in the background is the only noise breaking the stillness. He clears his throat, and I can sense a mix of nervousness and determination in his voice as he begins to speak. ""I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now,"" he says slowly, his words hanging in the air like a challenge. I lean forward, my curiosity piqued, and wait for him to continue."
"“I knew what Jake ordered for lunch and what kinds of stupid movies would make him laugh, and I could predict all his pickup lines","at parties, but we didn’t ever, like, sit down and do backstory. He didn’t even mention he had a brother until he suggested I marry you.”",51,"by heart. I knew the way he'd smile when he was nervous, the way his eyes would light up when he was excited, and the way his voice would drop to a whisper when he was trying to be romantic. I knew him better than I knew myself, and yet, despite all of this, I couldn't help but feel like I was losing him. It was as if the more I knew him, the more he slipped away from me, like sand between my fingers. I tried to hold on tighter, to grasp at the fragments of our relationship, but it was no use. He was fading away, and I was powerless to stop it. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of memories, each one a reminder of what we had, and what we were losing. I knew every inch of his body, every curve and every contour, but I couldn't reach him, couldn't touch him, couldn't make him stay."
"“I definitely need to go back to the beginning,” I say, wiping my eyes. I mime an explosion at my temples. “Like—my mind is blown right now. You dressed like a middle schooler around the house. All basketball shorts, all the time. You drove a Honda! West, you’re incognito rich!","No wonder Jake never told me anything about his family! I would have made him pay for Jersey Mike’s every fucking time! Wait. Why did you need to live on campus? If you’re the grandson of the founder of Weston’s, you could probably buy an entire apartment building on Sunset.”",100,"I stare at him, trying to reconcile the West I thought I knew with this new information. He chuckles and leans back in his chair, a self-satisfied smirk on his face. ""I like to keep a low profile,"" he says, his eyes glinting with amusement. ""I've worked hard to build my business empire, and I don't need the attention that comes with flaunting my wealth. Besides, I like being able to move freely, without being recognized everywhere I go."" I shake my head, still trying to wrap my mind around this new reality. ""I had no idea,"" I admit, feeling a little embarrassed that I didn't see it sooner. West leans forward, his expression turning serious. ""That's exactly why I like you, though,"" he says, his voice low and sincere. ""You see me, not my bank account or my business deals. You see the real me, and that's incredibly refreshing."" I feel a flutter in my chest at his words, and I realize that I'm seeing him in a whole new light too."
"That lands in a puddle of silence, and it hits me after a couple of seconds filled only",with the sound of Conan kicking someone’s ass on TV that West expects me to catch his meaning.,36,"with the sound of my own breathing, that I've been holding onto this moment for what feels like an eternity, and the weight of it is crushing me. The world around me seems to have come to a standstill, and all that's left is the echo of my own heartbeat, pounding in my chest like a drum. I feel like I'm drowning in the stillness, suffocating under the pressure of my own thoughts, and I don't know how to escape. The silence is deafening, a cacophony of nothingness that's screaming in my ears, and I'm desperate to break free from its grasp. But for now, I'm trapped, suspended in this moment, unable to move forward or backward, stuck in the quicksand of my own emotions."
“Correct.” He looks down to his lap. “Only Jake knew the real situation. The rest of my family was disappointed that,"I didn’t let them throw me a big wedding, but I guess they weren’t all that surprised. I’ve always been private.”",42,"their son had chosen to pursue a career in the arts, rather than following in his father's footsteps in the family business. They had always envisioned him as a successful entrepreneur, not a struggling artist. Jake, on the other hand, had been his confidant, the one person who truly understood his passion and supported his dreams. He remembered the countless nights they had spent talking about their aspirations, sharing their fears and doubts, and encouraging each other to take risks. Jake's unwavering support had given him the courage to pursue his goals, even when the rest of his family had lost faith in him. Now, as he sat in the dimly lit room, he couldn't help but feel a deep sense of gratitude towards his friend, and a pang of sadness that he was no longer there to share in his struggles and triumphs."
"He looks me over again, top to bottom, and the defeat in his eyes makes me realize the true extent of my unshowered, feral chaos. “Actually,","Anna,” he says, “I need you to come with me to my sister’s wedding in Indonesia and convincingly play the part of my very loving wife.”",52,"“Actually, I think I'll just take your word for it,” he says, his voice laced with amusement, and I can tell he's trying not to laugh. He takes a step back, eyeing me warily, as if I might suddenly sprout fur and claws. I glance down at myself, realizing that maybe I do look a bit more like a wild animal than a functioning member of society. My hair is a tangled mess, my clothes are stained and torn, and I'm pretty sure I've got a few days' worth of dirt and grime caked onto my skin. I look up at him, feeling a flush rise to my cheeks, and he quickly looks away, clearing his throat. “So, uh, what's the plan here?” he asks, trying to sound nonchalant, but I can tell he's still trying not to stare at me in horror."
"It’s surreal to be here with her after all this time. I was so close to being done with this, so near to the finish line, yet here I am, having to improvise an intricate plan B at the eleventh hour with a Muppet in human form as my co-conspirator. Don’t get me wrong, beneath the baked, unshowered disarray, Anna is still a beautiful woman, with enormous brown eyes, creamy skin, and long, willowy limbs. I’d always been fascinated with the perfect beauty mark just above her lip. Unfortunately, right now she looks like","she’s fallen out of a tree and crawled through a field of tangly briers to get back to her apartment. This is probably the closest I’ve ever seen to her natural hair color because the pink has grown out a good inch, leaving a stripe of brown at her roots. Her makeup is, I presume, from yesterday; shadows of mascara carve dark circles beneath her eyes. Despite the old makeup and frazzled appearance, there’s still something striking about her. Her eyes are enormous and bright, framed with dark lashes, her steady gaze entirely without artifice.",189,"she just rolled out of a dumpster. Her hair is a tangled mess, her clothes are stained and reek of last night's Chinese takeout, and the beauty mark I once found so captivating is now partially hidden behind a smudge of what looks suspiciously like yesterday's mascara. I try not to stare, but it's hard not to notice the stark contrast between the woman I once knew and the hot mess standing in front of me. We're in the middle of a deserted alleyway, the only sound the distant hum of a city that never sleeps. I glance around nervously, hoping no one is watching us. We can't afford to draw attention to ourselves, not now, not when we're so close to the truth. Anna seems to sense my unease and shoots me a reassuring smile, her eyes sparkling with a hint of mischief. It's a look I've seen before, one that always gets us into trouble. I take a deep breath and try to focus on the task at hand. We need to get in, get the evidence, and get out without getting caught. Easy enough, right? I glance at Anna, and she nods in agreement. We're in this together, for better or for worse. I just hope it's not the latter. With a deep breath, we set off towards the building, our hearts pounding in unison as we embark on this crazy, reckless adventure. The question is, will we make it out alive?"
"Though I am nearly certain her mind has wandered to something other than the topic at hand, I let her stare at the wall",a little longer so I can stare at her and reconcile this version of Anna with the one I lived with for two years.,48,"for a moment, her eyes glazing over as if lost in thought. I've grown accustomed to these brief lapses in attention, and I know better than to interrupt her when she's in this state. It's as if she's retreated to a private world, one that I can only speculate about. Her gaze remains fixed on the same spot, her expression unreadable. I wait patiently, knowing that she'll eventually return to the present, her focus snapping back into place like a rubber band. The silence between us is comfortable, a testament to the ease with which we've grown to understand each other's quirks and habits. As I sit here, I find myself pondering the mysteries that lie behind her distant stare, wondering what thoughts or memories have captured her attention. The minutes tick by, and I'm content to simply be, to exist in this quiet space with her, even if she's not entirely present."
"As roommates, we didn’t know each other well—that much is probably obvious—but there is an intimacy to sharing a space with someone, a certain kind of kinship that comes with daily proximity. Anna was reasonably tidy and paid her half of the rent when it was due, but she’d never struck me as the organized, driven, premed type. The one time we talked about it, she","said something about medicine being the most palatable of the “real job” options, but she seemed overwhelmed a lot, studying late into the night and painting to decompress in what little free time she had. That she ultimately switched her major to fine art makes a certain amount of sense, but I want to punch myself for not realizing she wasn’t studying medicine at all anymore.",132,"had mentioned something about wanting to be a doctor, but it seemed like a vague aspiration, the kind of thing people say when they're not really sure what they want to do with their lives. I'd always assumed she was just drifting through college, taking a few premed courses to appease her parents or something. But now, as I stood in the empty apartment, staring at the neat stack of boxes and the spotless kitchen, I realized I'd misjudged her. Anna had been planning this move for a long time, and she'd been doing it quietly, without drawing attention to herself. I felt a twinge of guilt for not knowing her better, for not being more supportive. We'd lived together for two years, and yet I'd never really taken the time to get to know her. I wondered what other secrets she'd been keeping, what other plans she'd been making without me noticing. As I finished packing up the last of my things and prepared to leave the apartment for good, I couldn't help but feel a sense of regret for not being a better roommate, a better friend."
"Anna squints at me. “You said ‘small,’ but I think you meant","‘private.’ Your sister is getting married on a private island, isn’t she?”",24,"“medium” or maybe even “large,” because this is a lot more than I was expecting,” she says, her voice laced with amusement. I can tell she's trying not to laugh, but the corners of her mouth are twitching, and her eyes are sparkling with mirth. I feel a flush rise to my cheeks as I realize my mistake, and I try to play it off, but Anna just chuckles and shakes her head. “Well, I suppose we can make it work,” she says, and together we begin to sort through the piles of stuff, trying to make sense of the chaos."
"“Yes.” I work to not let my gaze do another sweep of her apartment. I’ve never been to Pulau Jingga, but my mom has been sending me info that I’ve mostly ignored for months. I know the basic idea—a luxury resort and conservation area set in the Indonesian archipelago—and it’s about","as far from this dark, cramped living room as I can imagine. Right now, I need Anna to believe she can do this. Yes, she may be at rock bottom, but I need her to think she is just one fairy godmother moment away from sliding gracefully into the world she’s imagining.",103,"an hour's flight from Jakarta. But beyond that, I'm clueless. I've been too caught up in my own life to pay much attention to her plans. Now, as I stand in her apartment, I'm starting to feel a pang of regret for not being more supportive. The room is filled with maps and brochures, and there's a large model of the resort on the coffee table. It looks like a miniature paradise, with crystal-clear waters and lush green forests. I can see why she's so drawn to it. ""So, what's the plan?"" I ask, trying to sound more interested than I feel. ""Are you going to be working there or just visiting?"" She hesitates, and for a moment, I think she's not going to answer. But then she takes a deep breath and launches into a detailed explanation of her vision for the resort. As she talks, her eyes light up, and I can see the passion and excitement she feels for this project. I find myself getting caught up in her enthusiasm, and before I know it, I'm asking questions and making suggestions. It's not until she stops talking and looks at me expectantly that I realize I've been monopolizing the conversation. ""Sorry,"" I say, feeling a flush rise to my cheeks. ""I got a bit carried away."" She smiles and pats my hand. ""It's okay,"" she says. ""I'm just glad you're interested."" We sit there in silence for a moment, looking at the model of the resort. I can feel the weight of her gaze on me, and I know she's waiting for me to say something. But what can I say? That I'm happy for her, but I'm also scared? That I don't know if I'm ready for this? I take a deep breath and try to find the right words. ""I'm happy for you,"" I say finally. ""I know how much this means to you."" She nods, and for a moment, I think that's enough. But then she speaks up again. ""I want you to come with me,"" she says, her voice barely above a whisper. I feel like I've been punched in the gut. ""What?"" I ask, trying to play it cool. ""I want you to come to Pulau Jingga with me,"" she repeats. ""I want you to see the resort and meet the people I've been working with. I think you'll love it."" I'm taken aback by the request. I hadn't expected her to ask me to go with her. I don't know what to say, so I just sit there, looking at her. She takes my silence as a sign that I'm considering it, and she starts to tell me more about the resort and the people she's met. As she talks, I find myself getting more and more caught up in her vision. Maybe this is exactly what I need – a chance to get away and clear my head. Maybe this is the opportunity I've been waiting for. I look at her, and for the first time, I see the possibility of a new adventure stretching out before us. ""Okay,"" I say finally, the word barely above a whisper. ""I'll come with you."" Her face lights up, and she throws her arms around me. ""I'm so glad,"" she says, her voice muffled against my shoulder. I hug her back, feeling a sense of excitement and trepidation. What have I just gotten myself into?"
"Anna looks down at herself and I follow her attention to the front of her shirt, where a Froot Loop adheres to the cotton over her left breast.",She plucks it off and pops it into her mouth. “Why not just find someone who can pretend to be me and who knows how to behave around societay?”,57,"The cereal piece is a bright, cheerful orange, a stark contrast to the dull, muted tones of the rest of her outfit. I stifle a chuckle, not wanting to draw attention to the awkward situation. Anna, however, seems completely unfazed, her expression a picture of serenity as she plucks the offending cereal piece from her shirt and pops it into her mouth. She chews thoughtfully for a moment before swallowing, her eyes never leaving mine. I raise an eyebrow, intrigued by her nonchalant demeanor. ""Froot Loops for breakfast?"" I ask, trying to sound casual. Anna nods, a small smile playing on her lips. ""I was in a hurry,"" she explains, her voice low and smooth. ""I didn't have time to eat at home, so I grabbed a handful on my way out the door."" I nod sympathetically, remembering the countless mornings I'd done the same thing. ""Well, at least you're getting your daily dose of fiber,"" I say, trying to lighten the mood. Anna laughs, a soft, throaty sound, and I feel a spark of connection ignite between us."
“I have the one of you and Jake hiking the Hills in a frame in my living room. It,"looks enough like me from the back.” I pause, scratching my jaw. “And… I’ve had a few others digitally photoshopped.”",39,"reminds me of the good old days when life was simpler, and our biggest worry was what trail to take next. I often find myself lost in thought, staring at that photo and reminiscing about the laughter we shared, the adventures we had, and the memories we created together. Sometimes, I'll catch myself smiling as I recall the time Jake tried to climb that massive boulder and ended up tumbling down, or the way the sunlight filtered through the trees, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. It's amazing how a single photograph can evoke such strong emotions and transport me back to a moment in time that feels like a lifetime ago. I'm grateful to have that frame as a reminder of the incredible bond we shared, and I look forward to creating many more memories with you in the years to come."
"“That it’s small, upturned. She described it as ‘the nose Jenny Nelson",wanted and didn’t get.’ She’d notice if it was someone else’s nose.”,24,"would have if she were a pixie.’ It was a nose that seemed to be sniffing out adventure, always slightly upturned as if sensing something wonderful just around the corner. Her eyes sparkled with mirth as she recalled Jenny's words, and she couldn't help but smile at the memory of her friend's whimsical description. The image of Jenny, with her wild curly hair and infectious laugh, was forever etched in her mind, a reminder of the carefree days they spent exploring the rolling hills and verdant forests of their childhood."
"I don’t love the implication that I don’t work, that I’m trying to breeze through life on my inheritance, but I understand why she sees it that way. The truth behind everything isn’t important right now, and if this goes the way I hope it","will, this will be an easy twelve days together and then we’ll never have to see each other again. “Anna, are you available to do this? Please. I will pay all your expenses. I will even give you some money if you need to buy clothes.”",91,"it will, then I'll have the chance to prove myself to her and everyone else. I've been working hard behind the scenes, investing my inheritance wisely and building a business that I'm passionate about. It's not just about the money; it's about creating something that will outlast me and make a real difference in people's lives. I know it won't be easy, and there will be plenty of obstacles along the way, but I'm ready for the challenge. I'm ready to show the world what I'm capable of, and I'm ready to make my family proud. The thought of it is exhilarating, and I can feel my heart racing with anticipation. I take a deep breath, trying to calm my nerves, and focus on the task at hand. I need to stay focused and composed if I'm going to pull this off. I glance around the room, taking in the familiar sights and sounds of the old mansion. It's a place that holds a lot of memories for me, both good and bad. I've spent countless hours within these walls, laughing and arguing with my family, and now it's all coming down to this one moment. I feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me, but I push it aside. This isn't the time for sentimentality; it's time for action. I straighten my shoulders, take one last deep breath, and begin to make my way to the meeting room. The fate of my family's legacy, and my own future, hangs in the balance. I'm ready to do whatever it takes to ensure that everything works out the way I hope it will."
"Anna points at me again. “Okay, I see that look, and so",let me ask: what manner of clothes are required on this trip?”,24,"does she take a deep breath before continuing, ""I know you're trying to tell me something, but I'm not sure I'm ready to hear it yet, so just give me a minute, okay?"" Her eyes lock onto mine, and I can see the mixture of curiosity and apprehension swirling in their depths, making me wonder what she's expecting me to say. The air is thick with tension as we stand there, the only sound being the distant hum of the city outside our little bubble of uncertainty."
"“No, no, no.” Anna sits up and runs her fingers under her eyes, clearing away much of the mascara there. She pulls her ponytail free and reties it. Both actions do wonders for how chaotic she looks.",“This is much more demanding. I’ll have to act. I’ll have to learn about everyone I’ll be meeting. I’ll have to manage your complete lack of humor. I’ll have to hobnob. This is an entirely new skill set.”,75,"As she stands up, the dim lighting in the room seems to swallow her whole, making her appear almost ethereal. She takes a deep breath, and her shoulders relax ever so slightly, the tension easing out of her body. Her eyes, though still red-rimmed, sparkle with a hint of determination as she begins to pace back and forth across the small space. The soft rustle of her clothes and the creak of the old wooden floorboards beneath her feet are the only sounds that break the silence. She's lost in thought, her mind racing with the events that have led her to this moment. The air is thick with unspoken words, and the weight of her emotions hangs heavy, like a challenge waiting to be confronted. With each step, she seems to gather strength, her resolve hardening into a steely determination that will either be her salvation or her downfall."
"“Babe, babe,” she says, cupping my cheeks. “There is",no downside here. Are you kidding? This is life-altering good.”,19,"something I need to tell you, something that's been weighing on my mind for a while now, and I don't know how you'll react, but I have to be honest with you, it's about us, about our future, and the choices we need to make together."
"“Insurance,” she says. “These people insure everything.” While I continue to stare at the rock, she returns to the list and laughs. “Get","this: ‘Anna, please feel free to schedule any hair, nails, spa, or grooming appointments and use the card to pay for those.’ ”",46," this one: 'In the event of a zombie apocalypse, the policyholder will be entitled to a full refund of all premiums paid, provided they can produce a death certificate for the policyholder and a minimum of three eyewitness accounts of the zombie attack.' I look up at her, incredulous. 'You're kidding me, right?' She shakes her head, still chuckling. 'I wish I was. And it gets even better. Apparently, the policy also covers 'acts of God', 'alien invasions', and 'unforeseen consequences of time travel'. I raise an eyebrow. 'Time travel?' She nods. 'Yeah, I know. I'm starting to think these people have been watching too many sci-fi movies.' I snort, trying to imagine the kind of person who would actually buy into this kind of thing. 'I guess you could say they're covering all their bases,' I say, trying to stifle a grin. She smiles back at me. 'Yeah, or maybe they just really love a good story.' We both laugh, and for a moment, the absurdity of it all is almost too much to handle."
There are two kinds of airport people: those who like to get to the,"airport three hours before departure to sit within eyesight of the gate, and Anna Green.",29,"airport hours in advance, and those who like to arrive just as their flight is boarding. The former group is often comprised of anxious travelers who want to account for every possible delay, from traffic jams to long security lines. They arrive at the airport with plenty of time to spare, and spend their extra hours browsing duty-free shops, grabbing a bite to eat, or simply people-watching from a comfortable seat. On the other hand, the latter group is often made up of more laid-back travelers who are confident in their ability to navigate the airport quickly and efficiently. They may even see the airport as an inconvenience, a necessary evil that stands between them and their final destination. Despite their differences, both types of airport people share a common goal: to get to their gate on time and catch their flight without any issues."
"My eyes go wide, meeting Anna’s just as she stumbles,","ankle twisting awkwardly on the skinny, murder-sharp heel of her shoe.",21,"her eyes locked on mine with a mixture of shock and desperation as she struggles to regain her balance, her hands grasping wildly for something, anything, to steady herself, but it's too late, she's already falling, and I'm frozen in place, unable to move, unable to help, as she crashes to the ground with a soft thud, the sound echoing through the silence like a scream."
"I can’t entirely refute this idea. I’ve been out of my parents’ circle long enough to understand how disorienting it will be for Anna to step into it. She bends her fingers, turning her hand and looking at them from another angle. Frankly, they’re so pointy I’m worried she’ll scratch her own cornea.","“But I asked the woman at the spa what the really rich ladies get, and she said it’s this fancy hard gel. I think I get the urge to have fake nails. I feel like a badass.” Twisting in her seat, she deposits her purse in my lap. “Watch this for a sec?”",106,"Her eyes light up with a mixture of fascination and concern as she inspects her fingers, and I can almost see the wheels turning in her head. She's always been a bit of a worrier, and I can tell she's already imagining all the potential hazards of having pointy fingers. I try to reassure her, explaining that she'll get used to them in no time, but she's not convinced. She starts to fidget, her fingers twitching with anxiety, and I can tell she's on the verge of a panic attack. I quickly grab her hand, holding it firmly in mine, and try to calm her down. ""Hey, it's okay,"" I say softly. ""We'll figure this out together. We'll learn how to deal with these... unique features of yours."" I smile, trying to reassure her, but she just looks up at me with a skeptical expression. ""You don't understand,"" she says, her voice barely above a whisper. ""I don't know how to be me anymore."" My heart goes out to her, and I pull her into a hug, holding her close as she struggles to come to terms with her new reality."
"“Okay, okay. I’m on my way.” Slinging her purse over my shoulder and collecting our carry-ons, I make my way to the ladies’ room, where","Anna peeks out into the hallway. As soon as she sees me, she reaches forward, grabbing the front of my shirt and jerking me inside.",50,"my sister is waiting for me, looking frazzled as she tries to corral our rambunctious toddler, Emily, who is busy making a beeline for the row of sinks, eager to play with the automatic soap dispensers. I quickly grab Emily and swing her up into my arms, trying to distract her with a silly face while my sister takes a deep breath and smooths out her rumpled dress. ""Sorry about this,"" she mouths to me over Emily's head, ""I was hoping to get a few more minutes of peace before we board."" I just roll my eyes good-naturedly and hand her a hair tie from my purse. ""Here, use this. You look like you just stuck your finger in a socket."" My sister laughs and takes the tie, quickly pulling her hair back into a neat ponytail as we make our way out of the restroom and back into the bustling airport terminal."
Apologizing over her shoulder to a woman washing her hands at the sink—“I swear we,aren’t going to have sex in here!”—Anna pulls me into a stall and flips the lock.,31,"don't usually make a mess like this, I promise!”—she hastily grabbed a handful of paper towels and began to blot the spill, trying to contain the damage before it spread further across the counter. The woman at the sink, seemingly unbothered by the commotion, continued to wash her hands with a gentle, methodical rhythm, her eyes fixed on the soap suds as if lost in thought. As the girl worked to clean up the spill, she couldn't help but steal glances at the woman, wondering what her story was and what had brought her to this place at this particular moment in time."
"“I need you there,” I clarify. “And I need you to look like you’re comfortable with me, comfortable","being married to me. But I don’t need you to pretend to not be Anna Green, Muppet-human hybrid.”",36,"with the situation, and most importantly, comfortable with yourself. I know it's a lot to ask, but I'm counting on you to make this work. We can't afford to raise any suspicions, not now, not when we're so close to achieving our goal. I've been watching you, and I know you have the skills to pull this off. Just remember, it's all about confidence and attitude. You need to own the room, to make everyone believe that you're exactly where you're meant to be. Can I trust you to do that for me?"
Her eyes go round. “The fam—” Anna shakes her head. “You know what? Never mind. Of,"course you have a plane.” Straightening, she asks, “So, why was I in Cambodia? Photography? Fabric design?”",33,"course, I know what you're getting at,"" I say, trying to sound nonchalant despite the fact that my heart is racing. ""But let's just focus on the task at hand, shall we?"" Anna raises an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced, but she lets it drop. For now, at least. We continue on in silence, the only sound being the soft crunch of gravel beneath our feet as we make our way through the deserted alley. The air is thick with tension, and I can feel Anna's eyes on me, boring into my skin like a drill. I try to shake off the feeling, telling myself I'm just being paranoid, but I know better. Anna's not one to let things go easily, and I have a feeling this conversation is far from over."
"Once, when we were roommates, Anna flew to Seattle with a friend. It had been her first time on an airplane, and she struggled so much navigating the travel website that she brought me her laptop at midnight and asked for help. I finished the transaction for her, prebooked the car","to the airport, and then quietly tracked the ride the day she left to make sure she got there okay. When she got home, she made a point of thanking me for the help. Apparently, the trip itself was fine, but the highlight for her had been flying on an airplane.",102,"service, and even printed out the boarding passes. She was so relieved that she offered to take me out for a celebratory drink, and we ended up laughing and chatting for hours at a nearby bar. It was moments like those that I cherished about our friendship - the way we could be there for each other, no matter what. After she returned from her trip, Anna would often talk about the stunning natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest, and how it had left her in awe. Her stories sparked a desire in me to explore more of the world, and I began to make my own travel plans. As we sat on the couch, swapping stories and sharing laughter, I felt grateful for the adventures we had shared, and the many more that were yet to come. Our friendship was a reminder that life was full of possibilities, and that sometimes, all it took was a little help from someone you trusted to set you on your way."
"“That person deserves jail time.” She brings the glass to her lips, taking a tiny","sip. “Mmmmm.” Anna turns to meet my eyes. “And by the way, it’s anything over ninety-nine.”",31,"sip of the amber liquid, her eyes never leaving the television screen as the news anchor continues to recount the details of the scandal. The camera pans to a shot of the accused, a smug expression plastered on their face, and she feels a surge of indignation. ""How could they be so reckless and irresponsible?"" she mutters to herself, shaking her head in disgust. Her companion, sitting beside her on the couch, nods in agreement, and they both sit in silence for a moment, lost in their own thoughts. The sound of the television fades into the background as they process the gravity of the situation, the weight of the accused's actions sinking in. Suddenly, her companion speaks up, ""I don't know how they can live with themselves,"" they say, their voice laced with a mix of anger and sadness. She turns to them, her expression somber, and replies, ""I don't know either."""
Anna’s smiling at me like I amuse her. “I meant more as,"in, is she nice? Does she have hobbies or a favorite band?”",24,"a general statement, not a personal attack,” she says, her voice laced with a hint of amusement, as if she's enjoying a private joke at my expense. Her eyes sparkle with mirth, and I find myself wondering what I've done to entertain her so thoroughly. The smile still playing on her lips, she leans in, her voice taking on a conspiratorial tone, ""But since you brought it up, tell me, what do you think is the most ridiculous thing about our situation?"""
“Oh. Power. I like it. I’m not sure how to wield,"it, but I like it. And you have three siblings, including Jake?”",23,"it, but I can feel its potential coursing through my veins like liquid fire. The words of the ancient prophecy echo in my mind, 'The one who wields the power shall bring balance to the universe.' I look around, trying to make sense of the strange symbols etched into the walls, hoping to find a clue to unlock the secrets of this mysterious energy. As I touch the markings, the air around me begins to shimmer, and I feel the power surging through me, urging me to take control. But at what cost?"
I feel her looking at me for a quiet beat. “I think you’re joking. I’m,not sure.” Anna downs the rest of her prosecco. “A hint of danger. I like it.”,31,"not sure what you're insinuating, but I can assure you, I am dead serious. The look on her face is a mix of confusion and concern, her eyes narrowing slightly as she tries to read my expression. I can tell she's trying to gauge whether I'm being sarcastic or not, but I'm not giving her any hints. The air is thick with tension as we sit there, the only sound being the soft hum of the coffee shop's espresso machine in the background. I take a sip of my coffee, the bitterness a stark contrast to the sweetness of the pastry I had earlier. The silence between us is palpable, and I can feel her eyes burning a hole into my skin. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up, but I'm determined to see this through."
“Is now a good time to discuss how you looked at me like I was lobotomized when I thought,your name was West Weston and yet a man named Kellan McKellan actually exists and will soon be your relative?”,39,"the new policy was a good idea? I mean, I know I'm not the most experienced person in the room, but I'm not completely clueless either. I've been paying attention and trying to learn as much as I can. I just think that sometimes you can be a bit... dismissive. Like, I'll be trying to contribute to the conversation and you'll give me this look, like I've just said something ridiculous. It's not exactly the most encouraging thing in the world. I'm trying to help, but it feels like you don't take me seriously. Can we talk about that?"
I can feel her staring a beat longer before she turns away to hand her,"empty flute to the flight attendant. Anna returns her focus to me. “Okay, what else?”",30,"the cup of coffee to the customer, her eyes never meeting mine as she takes the payment and hands over the change, the tension between us palpable as the morning sunlight streams through the café window, casting a warm glow over the bustling atmosphere, yet unable to penetrate the chill that has settled over us, a chill that seems to grow thicker with each passing moment, each unspoken word hanging in the air like a challenge, waiting to be addressed, yet neither of us willing to be the first to break the silence."
"West looks at me with unmasked concern. “Please, Anna,” he","says gently like I’m very, very naive. “Just follow my lead.”",21,"says softly, his voice low and soothing, as if trying to calm a frightened animal, ""you have to tell me what's going on. You can't just shut down like this and expect me to do nothing. I care about you, Anna, and I need to know what's wrong."""

"Janet steps close, her hair in a perfect white-blond chignon, her collarbones so defined they’re like hangers holding up her delicate","yellow sundress. I have to assume she has an extremely deft plastic surgeon, because she somehow looks like a twenty-five-year-old sixty-year-old.",42,"neck, her eyes gleaming with a mixture of curiosity and wariness as she takes in the scene before her. The dim lighting of the room casts an ethereal glow on her features, making her appear almost otherworldly. She moves with a quiet confidence, her slender fingers trailing over the edge of the nearby table as if searching for something, though her gaze remains fixed intently on the figure standing across from her. The air is heavy with tension, the silence between them thick and palpable, like a challenge waiting to be met. Janet's eyes narrow ever so slightly, her lips compressing into a thin line as she waits for some sign, some indication of what is to come. The room seems to hold its breath, the shadows cast by the flickering lights dancing across the walls like restless spirits, as the two figures stand locked in a silent standoff, each waiting for the other to make the first move."
"“Anna, darling!” The woman I need to remember is my actual mother-in-law air-kisses","both of my cheeks. “My goodness, in person your hair is so pink!”",26,"my cheek, her eyes scanning the room with a mixture of curiosity and disapproval. I can tell she's already spotted the empty champagne glasses and the scattered canapés, and I mentally prepare myself for the inevitable lecture on my hosting skills. Or lack thereof. My husband, Alex, appears at my side, a charming smile plastered on his face as he greets his mother with a warm hug. I try to mimic his enthusiasm, but my mind is already racing with the impending conversation about our future plans, or rather, the lack of them. As we exchange small talk, I find myself wondering how I'm going to get through this evening without any major faux pas."
“Okay. Well. That’s nice.” Janet pats his hand in hers. “Don’t forget about the cocktail party at six.”,"She leans in, kissing her son’s cheek again. “Can’t wait to get some time with you all to myself.”",37,"He nods, still looking a bit dazed, and Janet can't help but feel a pang of concern. She's been noticing that he's been a bit off lately, and she's not sure what's causing it. She makes a mental note to talk to him about it later, but for now, she just smiles and heads out the door, leaving him to his thoughts. As she walks to the party, she can't help but wonder what's going on with him, and whether everything is okay. The sun is setting over the city, casting a warm orange glow over the streets, and Janet feels a sense of unease settle in the pit of her stomach. She pushes it aside and focuses on the party, but she can't shake the feeling that something is off."
"“Anna,” he says finally, very gently. “The truth is, you could just smile on my arm and be okay. I promise",I’m not trying to leave you unprepared. The sad reality is that my parents are unlikely to pay you much attention regardless.”,43,"that you'll be safe with me. I'll make sure of it. But I want you to know that you're more than just a pretty face, Anna. You're smart, and funny, and kind. You light up the room with your presence, and I feel so lucky to be the one by your side. I know we've only just met, but I feel a connection with you that I've never felt with anyone before. I want to get to know you better, to see where this journey takes us. I want to be the one you turn to when you need a shoulder to cry on, or a hand to hold. I want to be your rock, your safe haven. So, will you take a chance on me, Anna? Will you let me show you what it means to be truly loved and cherished?"
"I walk back inside, realizing I’d been so focused on the sleeping situation, I haven’t properly flailed over the sheer bliss that is our bungalow. In fact, I’m pretty sure the only thing in here I could afford is the roll of eco-friendly toilet paper I can clearly see from where I stand. And even that looks pretty fancy. There’s a real Isle Esme feel to the decor (if you know, you know), with carved bamboo, recycled teak, jellyfish light fixtures, and a massive canopy bed. Wide windows and the open entrance","bring the outside in and allow me to glance over at West, who seems to be mid–mental spiral, managing to look even more morose than he did thirty seconds ago. Isle Esme vibes or not, there will be no headboard breaking here. Near one wall is a chest with our names stamped into the top, a pair of towels folded to look like stingrays, and a jar of chocolate chip cookies that are probably made with the world’s most expensive chocolate but hey, Gede did say it was all-inclusive. I help myself.",184,"allow for an abundance of natural light to pour in, illuminating the entire space and making it feel even more spacious. I notice a small, intimate seating area with plush cushions and a low-slung coffee table, perfect for sipping coffee or enjoying a romantic dinner. The walls are adorned with vibrant artwork and colorful tapestries, adding a pop of color to the otherwise natural and earthy tones of the bungalow."
"I have a lot of faults. I drink milk from the carton, I never make my bed, I am slothful, and sometimes I’ll just set the new roll of toilet paper on top of the empty roll instead of changing it. A monster. I am also gluttonous: I don’t want a few peanut M&M’s; I want the entire bag. Why have one","margarita when three is such a nice, satisfying number? Everyone knows why! And that’s why I go back for seconds right now. But karma is Team West: his eyes open just as I glance again. They widen and he reaches down to cup his Goddamn before he turns, facing away. “Anna,” he says, his voice spluttering in the water’s spray. “Are you peeking?”",125,"cookie when you can have a whole package? I have a hard time saying no to myself when it comes to sweets, and I often find myself eating an entire pizza by myself in one sitting. My lack of self-control is a major flaw, and it's something I've been trying to work on for years. I've tried setting boundaries for myself, like only allowing myself to have one slice of pizza or one cookie, but it never seems to work out. I always end up going back for more, and before I know it, the whole thing is gone. It's not just food either - I have a hard time saying no to myself when it comes to shopping, too. I'll see something I want and I'll buy it, without even thinking about whether or not I really need it. It's a bad habit, and it's one that I'm trying to break. I know I'm not alone in this, though - I've talked to friends who have the same problem, and we all seem to struggle with it. Maybe it's just a matter of finding the right balance and being more mindful of our actions. I'm not sure, but I'm determined to figure it out and become a better, more self-controlled version of myself."
"He was right. Focus was always a challenge, and apparently it didn’t end with baseball. I came here with the knowledge that all I need to do is limp this lie to September, and I can finally exhale, but we’re less than an hour into this farce and I’m already off track:","I peeked, and it was a huge mistake. It’s not that I didn’t know Anna was attractive all those years ago; it’s that we barely saw each other, and I was so driven to finish my degree and never have to work for my father again that Anna—attractive or not—was easy to overlook.",105,"My mind keeps drifting back to the conversation I had with Rachel last night. She was going on and on about her new job, and I found myself zoning out, thinking about the upcoming game against the Yankees. I mean, what's the point of even having a girlfriend if I'm just going to tune her out all the time? I know I'm not the most attentive person, but it's not like I'm trying to be rude. It's just that my brain is always elsewhere, thinking about the next pitch, the next at-bat, the next game. And now, as I sit here in this conference room, I'm supposed to be focused on this meeting, but my mind is a million miles away, thinking about the upcoming season, and how I'm going to get through it without losing my mind. I glance around the room, trying to appear interested, but I can feel my eyes glazing over as the speaker drones on. I'm a professional athlete, for crying out loud. I'm supposed to be able to focus. So why can't I seem to keep my mind on the task at hand? I take a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of restlessness that's been plaguing me all morning. I need to get it together, and fast, or this season is going to be a disaster."
"I smile at her and cup a hand to the side of my mouth, whispering, “It’s okay.” Truthfully, I love that she thinks about this. I love that she’s","horrified by that price. I’m horrified, too. It’s a good thing Anna isn’t my real wife; I would constantly worry that my proximity to this world would destroy her.",58,"thinking about the future, about us, about what could be. It's a feeling I've grown accustomed to, one that I've come to crave. As I glance over at her, I notice the way the dim lighting of the room dances across her features, illuminating the sharp lines of her jaw and the gentle curve of her lips. Her eyes, though, are what truly captivate me - they sparkle with a mix of excitement and nervousness, a potent combination that draws me in and makes me want to reassure her, to tell her that everything will be alright. I take a step closer, my voice barely above a whisper as I continue, ""We'll figure it out, together."" The words hang in the air, a promise that I intend to keep, as I reach out and gently brush a strand of hair behind her ear."
"Her hand falls away. “That’s Anna motherfucking Green-hyphen-Weston to you.” She lets out a happy squeal, jogging over",to hug him as well as she can without spilling the shots on either of them. “You look amazing!”,37,"to where her friends are waiting, a group of rowdy college students who are all cheering and whistling at her bold move. As she approaches, they high-five her and chant her name, drawing a crowd of onlookers who can't help but stare at the commotion. Anna laps up the attention, beaming with pride as she pumps her fist in the air, her bright pink hair clips glinting in the sunlight. The group begins to chant ""Anna, Anna, Anna"" as they make their way through the campus quad, leaving a trail of snickers and admiring glances in their wake. Meanwhile, the poor guy who had been on the receiving end of Anna's verbal smackdown slinks away, his face bright red with embarrassment, muttering something under his breath about ""crazy women"" and ""never messing with Anna Green-hyphen-Weston again."""
"The two of them walk back to me, and Jake looks over",his shoulder to make sure we’re alone. “How are my favorite liars doing?”,25,"at me with a mixture of confusion and curiosity, while Emily seems to be trying to stifle a smile, her eyes sparkling with amusement. As they approach, I can sense a strange tension in the air, as if they're both waiting for me to reveal some sort of secret. Jake's eyes narrow slightly, his brow furrowed in concern, while Emily's gaze darts back and forth between us, her expression a mask of innocence. I take a deep breath, preparing myself for the conversation that's about to unfold, wondering what it is that they've discovered, and how it will change everything."
"“Describe her,” Jake says, leaning in, his hair falling over his forehead in thick waves. There are moments where I see the man he could someday be: playful but grounded, flirtatious but loyal,",clever but humble. I want to know that version of him and worry he will forever be frozen in this caricature of the irresponsible youngest son as long as he works for Weston’s.,66,"and I wonder if that's the man he'll be with me. But for now, he's still a boy, and I'm not sure if I'm ready to be the one to help him grow up. I take a deep breath and try to focus on the task at hand. ""She's...beautiful,"" I start, the word feeling inadequate on my lips. ""Her hair is this wild tangle of curly brown locks, and her eyes are this bright, sparkling green. She's got this tiny nose ring and a scar above her left eyebrow that she got from a bar fight a few years ago."" Jake's eyes light up with excitement as I speak, and I can tell he's already imagining her, already falling for her. I feel a pang of jealousy, which I quickly push aside. This is just a game, after all. But as I continue to describe her, I start to feel a sense of unease. Who is this girl, really? And why am I so drawn to her? I glance over at Jake, who's still listening intently, and I realize that I'm not just describing her for his benefit. I'm trying to convince myself that she's real, that she's someone worth fighting for."
"Anna barks out a bawdy laugh before covering her mouth with her hand. “Sorry,” she says",from behind it. The diamond on her ring flashes in the flickering light. “That surprised me.”,32,"as she glances around the quiet café, realizing her outburst may have drawn unwanted attention. Her eyes sparkle with amusement, and she leans in closer to me, a mischievous grin still plastered on her face. ""I just can't help it,"" she whispers, her voice barely audible over the soft hum of the espresso machine. ""You have to admit, it's a pretty ridiculous situation."" She pauses, studying my reaction before continuing, her words spilling out in a hushed, conspiratorial tone."
"“Good. Anna has no poker face. How’s she taking everything?” he asks, and","I know what he’s referring to: the planes, the island, the money. The family.",27,"his eyes flicker to the woman in question, who's sitting on the couch, her eyes fixed on some point on the floor as if willing herself to become invisible. Her face is a picture of distress, her lips pressed together and her eyebrows furrowed in concern. ""She's taking it hard,"" he says, his voice low and even, ""but she's trying to stay strong for the kids."" He pauses, collecting his thoughts before continuing, ""We've told them as much as we can, but they're still trying to process everything. It's a lot for them to take in."" He glances over at Anna again, his expression softening with sympathy. ""We're all trying to be there for each other, but it's tough. We're all still trying to come to terms with what's happened."""
"With a laugh, Jake rids himself of our shot glasses and snags two tumblers of whiskey off a passing tray. He","hands me one before lifting his own. “Well, whatever. To the final few months: if you pull this off, you’re free.”",42,"hands me one and we clink them together in a silent toast, the amber liquid sloshing gently as we take a sip. The burn of the whiskey is a welcome distraction from the tension that's been building between us all night. As we stand there, the sounds of the party swirling around us, I can feel the weight of Jake's gaze on me, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiles. I smile back, feeling a flutter in my chest, and we stand there for a moment, the only sound the soft clinking of the ice in our glasses. The music shifts, the beat picking up, and Jake sets his glass down, his eyes never leaving mine. ""Dance with me,"" he says, his voice low and husky, and I feel a shiver run down my spine as I nod, setting my own glass down and letting him lead me onto the crowded dance floor."
"He looks past me at the party, and I take stock of how he seems from the outside. He’s got Dad’s dark wavy hair and light brown eyes, but like me, he got his height from our mother, who","is almost six feet tall without the benefit of heels. Jake is good-looking, charismatic, and always up for some (mostly) good-hearted shit-stirring. My stomach sours with guilt for what I’m keeping from him. What I could potentially fuck up.",78,"was a towering figure in our lives, both physically and emotionally. I can see the same sharp jawline and determined glint in his eye that I've seen in old photos of her. But there's something else there too, something that I'm not sure I've seen before. A sense of uncertainty, maybe, or a hint of vulnerability. It's hard to tell, but it's definitely something that makes me want to reach out and ask if he's okay. As I watch, he takes a deep breath and turns back to me, a small smile playing on his lips. ""Hey, kiddo,"" he says, his voice low and rough. ""What's up?"" I shrug, feeling a little awkward. ""Just enjoying the party, I guess."" He nods, his eyes scanning the room. ""Yeah, it's definitely a celebration. I'm just glad we could make it."" I nod, feeling a pang of guilt. We hadn't been sure if we'd be able to come, not after everything that's happened. But in the end, we'd decided it was important to be here, to mark this occasion and move forward. As I look at my brother, I realize that I'm glad we did. Despite everything, despite the uncertainty and the fear, we're still here. And for now, that's enough."
"She laughs, angling her wrist so the diamond catches the lights overhead. “I know, right? For six months I just walked",around taking photos where I had to casually point at something with my left hand.” She scans the crowd. “Where’s Anna?”,42,"around with it in my pocket, feeling like the ultimate secret agent. I'd take it out and stare at it when no one was looking, wondering what it would be like to wear it out in public. And now, here I am, sparkling like a million bucks. It's surreal, to say the least. I keep expecting someone to tap me on the shoulder and tell me it's all been a mistake, that I'm just a normal person after all. But for now, I'm going to enjoy every minute of this fairytale. I glance over at him, and he's watching me with a warm smile, his eyes crinkling at the corners. He knows exactly what I'm thinking, and he's happy to be a part of it. We make a good team, he and I. We always have."
"I look up, too, searching the room again. She’s over by the dance floor, jumping around with little Nixon’s hands in hers.","The band is playing covers of pop hits, and Anna is entirely in her element: laughing, dancing, blissfully forgetting where she is.",44,"Her eyes sparkle with joy, and for a moment, I forget about the tension between us. I watch as she spins Nixon around, his giggles echoing through the room. The music is loud, but I can hear his squeals of delight as he tries to keep up with her. She's always had a way with kids, and it's clear Nixon adores her. I feel a pang of nostalgia, remembering the times we used to take him to the park and watch him play on the swings. Those were simpler times, before everything fell apart. I push the thoughts aside and focus on the present, my gaze still fixed on the two of them. They're having the time of their lives, and I'm grateful for that. As I watch, she catches my eye and smiles, and for a moment, it's like no time has passed at all."
"Janet smiles tightly. “Exactly.” Welp, there it is. She turns her",laser focus to me. “How do your professors react to your hair?”,23,"head and walks away, leaving me standing there, feeling like I've just been punched in the gut. I watch her go, trying to process what just happened. One minute we were fine, and the next, she's storming off. I'm left standing here, wondering what I did wrong. I replay our conversation in my head, trying to pinpoint the exact moment things went south. But it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack - I just can't seem to put my finger on it. I sigh and rub my temples, feeling a headache coming on. This is not how I envisioned our conversation going. Not by a long shot."
"“It’s unlikely,” I say, and every head turns my way. “Everyone needs seven to nine hours of sleep a night. You can try to convince yourself","you don’t need more, but over time you’ll build up a sleep debt. It probably affects your mental and physical health more than you realize, Alex.”",52,"otherwise, but the science is clear. Our bodies are wired to require a certain amount of rest in order to function properly. I glance around the room, meeting the skeptical gazes of my colleagues. We're a team of researchers, after all, and we know better than to disregard the evidence. Still, I can sense the desperation in the air. We've all been working non-stop for weeks, trying to meet the looming deadline for our project. The temptation to push through and get a few more hours of work in is strong, but I know it's a recipe for disaster. ""Trust me,"" I say, trying to sound convincing. ""If we don't get some rest, we'll be lucky to get anything done at all."" The room falls silent, and for a moment, I wonder if I've overstepped. But then, slowly, nods begin to spread around the table. Maybe, just maybe, we can learn to prioritize our own well-being, even in the face of intense pressure."
"“And what’s the deal with Alex? Based on the way you talked about him on the plane, I expected you","two to jovially poke at each other, but that was like dragging a proverbial sword through each other with your eyeballs.”",41,"to be a lot more enthusiastic about seeing him again. But when we got to the hotel, you barely even acknowledged his presence. Is everything okay between you two? You're not still upset about what happened at the conference, are you? I know he can come across as a bit arrogant sometimes, but he's really not that bad once you get to know him. Maybe I'm just being too sensitive, but it seemed like there was some tension between you two. Did something else happen that I'm not aware of? You've been friends with Alex for years, and I've always thought you two got along great. Is everything all right?"
"“Well, mostly because he’s an asshole. But also, kids growing up in a normal family get to be themselves, whoever that may be. But in families like","ours, one where everything basically revolves around keeping a single person happy—my dad—everybody has a role. My therapist used to refer to Alex as a flying monkey.”",54,"his, where the parents are always in the public eye, the kids are forced to put on a mask from a very young age. They have to be perfect, or at least appear to be, because the whole world is watching. And that can be incredibly suffocating. I mean, can you imagine having every move you make scrutinized and criticized? It's no wonder that so many celebrity kids struggle with their own identities and feel like they're living in the shadow of their parents' fame. It's a heavy burden to carry, and it's not something that I would wish on anyone. But at the same time, it's also a privilege, you know? I mean, these kids have access to resources and opportunities that most people can only dream of. So, it's a double-edged sword, really. On the one hand, they're under a microscope and can't make a move without being judged. On the other hand, they have the chance to make a real difference in the world and leave a lasting legacy. It's a complicated thing, and I'm not sure I would want to trade places with them, even if I could."
"“Like in The Wizard of Oz? Alex was my dad’s willing henchman, doing everything he said, kissing his ass, stirring up","shit just to turn us all in, then sit back and look like the good guy. He’s never grown out of it.”",43,"trouble wherever he went. My dad was the mastermind, always coming up with new schemes to get what he wanted, and Alex was more than happy to carry them out. I, on the other hand, was the rebel, always questioning my dad's motives and trying to do the right thing. It was a constant battle between us, with Alex caught in the middle, trying to please everyone. But as time went on, I started to realize that Alex's blind loyalty to my dad was not only annoying, but also a little scary. He would do anything to make my dad happy, even if it meant hurting others. I knew I had to be careful around him, but at the same time, I felt sorry for him. He was trapped in a world of my dad's making, and I wasn't sure if he would ever be able to escape."
"“What does that mean?” I ask. If Alex knew enough, he wouldn’t try",to take West down? Is this about the mysterious loophole in the trust?,26,"to explain it to me in such a vague way. He'd just tell me straight out, but instead, he's being cryptic, which only makes me more anxious. I press him for a clearer answer, my curiosity getting the better of me. ""What do you mean it's not going to be easy?"" I ask, trying to keep my tone neutral, but a hint of frustration seeps through. Alex looks around the room, as if searching for an escape route or a way to deflect my question, before finally focusing on me again. His eyes lock onto mine, and I sense a mixture of concern and determination in them."
West sits on the bench and pulls a shoe off. I set my clutch down on a shelf in the open closet. “I’m thinking Alex will take a keen,"interest in exactly how happy we seem.” I narrow my eyes, staring into the distance. “West… this assignment is no longer just ‘show up and wear a wedding ring.’ ”",59,"interest in the new project we've been discussing, don't you think?” West asks, his eyes fixed on the floor as he massages his foot. I nod in agreement, running my fingers over the intricate carvings on the shelf. The closet, much like the rest of the house, is a testament to West's impeccable taste in design. I make a mental note to ask him about the artist who created the carvings later. As I turn to face him, I notice the look of deep contemplation on his face. “You know, I was thinking we could also get Emma on board,” he says, his voice laced with a hint of excitement. I raise an eyebrow, intrigued by the suggestion. Emma's expertise in marketing would undoubtedly be an asset to the project, but I'm not sure if she's the right fit. I decide to reserve my judgment, choosing instead to hear West out. “What makes you think she'd be interested?” I ask, taking a seat beside him on the bench. West leans back, a faraway look in his eyes as he begins to explain his reasoning."
"I woke up around two this morning to find Anna wrapped around me. Despite what she’d told me about sleeping in one place all night, at some point she’d migrated across the massive bed to throw a","leg over my hip, send an arm over my torso, and press her face to my neck. It took monumental focus to not go hard against her inner thigh, and because of it, I’d slept like absolute shit.",75,"leg over me and snuggle into my side. I lay there for a moment, feeling her warmth and listening to her soft breathing. It was comforting, and I found myself smiling in the darkness. I gently wrapped my arm around her, holding her close, and drifted off to sleep again. When I woke up the next morning, Anna was still wrapped around me, her head on my chest. I stroked her hair, feeling a sense of peace wash over me. We lay there for a while, enjoying the quiet morning, before finally getting out of bed to start the day. As we went about our morning routine, I couldn't help but think about how nice it was to have her by my side. We moved in tandem, our movements practiced and comfortable, like we'd been doing this for years. I realized that I was getting used to having her around, and the thought sent a warmth through my chest. I looked over at her, and she caught my eye, smiling softly. I smiled back, feeling a sense of connection that I hadn't felt in a long time."
"My father’s question penetrates my fog, finally, and I straighten, pushing my salt-water-and-sweat damp hair off my forehead. The sun has only","just come up and it’s already sweltering. I bet Anna has already kicked off the blankets, letting the air cool her overheated skin.",45,"just begun its ascent over the ocean, casting a golden glow over the waves. I squint, feeling the warmth on my skin, and take a deep breath of the salty air. My father's eyes, a deep shade of blue that seems to see right through me, are fixed intently on my face. I can tell he's waiting for an answer, but my mind is still reeling from the events of the past few days. I try to gather my thoughts, to form some sort of coherent response, but my brain feels like it's stuck in the mud. I glance out at the water, watching as the waves roll in, one after another, each one a reminder of the vastness of the ocean and the mysteries that lie beneath its surface. My father's voice breaks into my reverie, his tone gentle but insistent. ""Hey, kiddo, you okay? You've been out here for hours. What's going on?"" I turn back to him, feeling a sense of trepidation wash over me. I know I need to tell him, to confide in him, but the words feel stuck in my throat."
"“JESUS CHRIST,” I BLURT, the second I turn at the corner of our bridge and step onto the deck of our bungalow. Anna is curled up in","a papasan, with a sketch pad in her seemingly bare lap. Honestly, from the first glimpse I get, I think she might be naked. “What are you doing?”",55,"the oversized hammock, gently swaying to the rhythm of the waves lapping against the shore. Her eyes are closed, and a serene smile plays on her lips as the warm sunlight casts a golden glow on her face. The sound of seagulls fills the air, and I can feel the salty breeze carrying the sweet scent of blooming beach flowers. I take a deep breath, feeling the stress of the past few days melt away as I gaze at the tranquil scene before me. Anna's peaceful expression is a balm to my frazzled nerves, and I feel a sense of gratitude wash over me for this little slice of paradise we've created together. As I approach her, she stirs, opening her eyes to meet mine, and I'm struck by the deep connection we share in this moment. ""Hey,"" she says softly, her voice barely above a whisper, ""welcome home."" I smile, feeling a sense of belonging, and settle in beside her, wrapping my arms around her as we watch the sun begin its slow descent into the ocean."
"Anna follows me. She’s loosely made the bed, but it still looks rumpled.",Slept in. By both of us. I squeeze my eyes shut against the reminder.,27,"The sheets are a tangled mess, and the comforter is bunched up at the foot of the bed. I can tell she was in a hurry to get out the door. I take a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of unease that's been growing inside me since last night. The room is quiet, except for the sound of the wind rustling through the trees outside. I walk over to the window and push it open, letting in a warm breeze that carries the scent of blooming flowers. As I stand there, I notice a piece of paper on the nightstand with a note scrawled on it in Anna's handwriting."
I sigh. I know she’s right but I’m already sleep-deprived and functioning on less than full brain power today.,I’m not sure I’m capable of dealing with both my family and Anna in this suit after last night. “Fine.”,39,"My mind is foggy, and all I can think about is crawling back into bed and hiding under the covers. I rub my temples, trying to ward off the impending headache that's been threatening to strike all morning. I know I need to focus, but my brain feels like mush, and I'm struggling to string together a coherent thought. I take a deep breath and try to shake off the fatigue, knowing I have to push through and get this done. But as I glance over at my to-do list, my eyes glaze over, and I feel my eyelids growing heavy once again."
“Oh!” Anna jerks a hand over her eyes. “Your Goddamn! Right there!” She turns away. “Sorry! I just—spaced,out—on your—God. And you’re not even harrrrrrr—Fuck me.” She coughs. “Okay. I’ll just meet you down at the restaurant.”,37,"out for a second. I didn't mean to stare,"" she says, her voice muffled by her hand. The sound of her embarrassed laughter fills the air as she tries to compose herself. ""I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to be rude."" She slowly lowers her hand, her eyes scanning the surrounding area as if searching for an escape or a distraction from the awkward moment. ""It's just...I've never seen anything like that before,"" she admits, her voice barely above a whisper. The tension is palpable as she struggles to find the right words to express herself without offending anyone. ""I mean, I've heard stories, but...wow."" Her eyes dart back to the object of her fascination, her expression a mix of shock, curiosity, and a hint of fear."
"I can feel Anna’s eyes on the side of my face. This is how it always starts with Alex, and whatever suspicion he has about my marriage will only make it","worse. I know it’s irrational and a remnant of how we used to one-up each other for our dad’s approval when we were kids, but I want to beat him. At everything.",63,"worse. I try to focus on the conversation, but my mind keeps drifting back to the argument Alex and I had last night. He's been distant lately, and I know he's been talking to someone, but I have no idea who it is or what they're saying. I feel a surge of anxiety as I wonder if Anna knows something I don't. I force myself to take a deep breath and try to shake off the feeling, but it's hard to concentrate when I can sense Alex's skepticism radiating towards me like a palpable force. I glance over at him, trying to read his expression, but his face is a mask of polite interest, giving nothing away. I turn back to Anna, trying to focus on what she's saying, but my mind is racing with worst-case scenarios. Is Alex going to confront me about whatever it is he thinks he knows? And what if Anna is in on it too? The thought sends a shiver down my spine as I struggle to maintain a facade of calm, all the while wondering what's really going on beneath the surface."
"Anna slams the brakes on this line of thinking by putting an arm around my back, resting the other hand on my stomach","and gently scratching, just like she unconsciously did last night. I work to suppress a shiver. Turning, she looks at him over her shoulder.",47,"and giving me a gentle squeeze. ""You're going to be a great mom,"" she says, her voice full of conviction. I look at her, feeling a mix of emotions: gratitude, love, and a hint of uncertainty. She smiles and continues, ""We'll figure this out together, okay? We'll read all the books, attend the parenting classes, and ask for advice from our friends and family. And when the time comes, we'll be ready."" Her words are reassuring, but I know that nothing can truly prepare me for the challenges of motherhood. I take a deep breath, trying to calm my nerves, and nod in agreement. Anna's grip on my stomach tightens slightly, and I feel a sense of comfort wash over me. We sit there in silence for a moment, enjoying the peacefulness of the evening, and the promise of a new chapter in our lives."
"Eko goes through the basics of paddling, giving us tips about what areas of the",reef to avoid as we approach. “Is everyone comfortable with the basics of kayaking?” she asks.,31,"blade to focus on for maximum efficiency, and how to position our bodies for optimal balance and control. As we make our way across the calm waters, Eko points out various landmarks and shares stories about the local wildlife, including the majestic sea turtles that call this place home. We take a break on a secluded beach, where Eko teaches us about the unique ecosystem of the mangrove forests and the importance of preserving these delicate environments. As the sun begins to set, we paddle back to the starting point, feeling invigorated and inspired by our time on the water."
"I reach back, pulling my T-shirt up and off, tossing it to the side. Alex hesitates and","then does the same, his expression turning homicidal when I smirk down at his soft little paunch.",34,"looks at me with a mixture of surprise and curiosity, his eyes scanning my torso before he seems to remember himself and looks away, a faint blush rising to his cheeks. I take a deep breath, feeling the cool air dance across my skin as I wait for him to make his next move. The silence between us is palpable, thick with unspoken tension, as we stand there, the only sound the distant hum of the city outside our little bubble. I can feel his eyes drifting back to me, his gaze like a gentle touch, and I wonder what he's thinking, what he's feeling in this moment. Is he going to take a step closer, or turn and walk away? The uncertainty is almost too much to bear, and I find myself holding my breath, waiting for the outcome."
"Alex snorts, looking at her derisively, like she’s an idiot. In a hot","flush, my hackles are up, and every rational thought goes out the window.",26,"second, her expression changes, and she takes a step closer to him, her eyes flashing with a mix of anger and hurt. ""You think you're so smart, don't you?"" she spits, her voice low and even, but laced with venom. ""You think you can just dismiss me like that, like I'm some kind of fool?"" She pauses, her chest heaving with emotion, as she searches his face for some sign of remorse, but Alex just shrugs, his expression unrepentant. ""What's wrong, can't handle the truth?"" he sneers, and she feels a surge of rage at his condescending tone."
"“Course you are, sweetheart,” I say, steadying my voice and looking down at Anna.",“I went running without you this morning and you really let me have it.”,28,"Her eyes are wide with fear, and I can see the faint tremble of her lower lip as she tries to hold back tears. I take a deep breath and try to reassure her, ""We'll get through this, okay? We'll figure it out together."" I force a gentle smile, trying to hide my own uncertainty, and glance around the dimly lit room, searching for any sign of what's happening. The air is thick with an eerie silence, and I can feel the weight of unseen eyes upon us. I pull Anna closer, my heart racing with every passing moment, as we wait for... something. Anything."
"“We work out together every morning.” I’m speaking to Alex but holding Anna’s gaze. Maybe it’s the pent-up frustration from last night, or maybe my brother just","brings out the worst in me and the best way to drag him is through his wife’s dissatisfaction, but I keep going. “Gets the blood flowing, doesn’t it?”",55,"has a knack for pushing my buttons, but I find myself wanting to provoke him further. ""You know, Alex, I've been thinking,"" I say, my voice low and even, ""maybe we should take our workouts to the next level. You know, really push ourselves."" Anna's eyes flicker with interest, and I can sense her curiosity piqued. Alex, on the other hand, looks like he's about to explode. His face reddens, and his jaw clenches, but he says nothing. The tension between us is palpable, and I can feel the air thickening with unspoken words. I take a step closer to Alex, my eyes locked on his, daring him to say something, to do something. The silence stretches out between us, a challenge waiting to be accepted. And then, just as suddenly as it began, the moment is broken. Anna clears her throat, and the sound is like a splash of cold water, shattering the tension. ""Hey, guys, let's not forget we're all on the same team here,"" she says, her voice light and even, but with a hint of warning. I feel a pang of guilt, knowing I've put her in an awkward position. But as I glance at Alex, I see the anger still simmering in his eyes, and I know this is far from over."
"And that much is immediately apparent. She trips as she tries to climb in. I hold the boat steady for her, but she still ends up getting","in backward and then having to awkwardly turn around in the tiny space. I pretend to scratch my shoulder with my chin, glancing behind us. Fuck. Alex noticed.",55,"her feet wet as she struggles to find her balance. I try to help her, but she brushes me off, determined to do it on her own. Finally, she manages to settle into the seat, her chest heaving with exertion. I push off from the shore and begin to row, the oars dipping smoothly into the water as we glide across the lake. The sun beats down on us, warming the wooden slats beneath our feet, and a gentle breeze stirs the reeds along the water's edge. As we move further from the shore, the sounds of the village grow fainter, replaced by the sweet songs of birds and the soft lapping of the water against the hull. She sits with her eyes closed, her face tilted up towards the sun, a look of serene contentment on her face. I watch her for a moment, feeling a sense of peace wash over me, before turning my attention back to the rowing."
"Just then, Anna looks over and lets out a high-pitched shriek. “West! A sea turtle!” She","leans to the side, and her oar slides off her lap and into the clear water.",32,"points excitedly towards the water, her eyes shining with excitement. West follows her gaze and his eyes widen in surprise as he takes in the sight of the majestic creature gliding effortlessly through the waves. The turtle's shell glistens in the sunlight, its flippers moving in a slow, rhythmic motion as it makes its way towards the shore. Anna and West watch in awe, hardly daring to breathe as the turtle draws closer, its ancient eyes seeming to hold a deep wisdom. As they stand there, frozen in wonder, the turtle swims right up to the water's edge and looks up at them, as if seeking connection with these two curious humans."
"“He and I have never been close,” I say quickly, suddenly and deeply uninterested in spending the morning anywhere but right","here with Anna. “I think from the moment he was born, the only thing he cared about was impressing our father.”",42,"here, surrounded by the comforting familiarity of my own home. I try to shake off the feeling of unease that's settled in the pit of my stomach, telling myself it's just nerves from the impending conversation. But as I glance over at him, I catch a glimpse of something in his eyes that makes my heart skip a beat - a flicker of understanding, of empathy, that I've never seen before. It's disarming, and for a moment, I forget about my defenses, about the walls I've built up around myself over the years. I forget, and that's what scares me. I take a deep breath, trying to compose myself, but my mind is already racing ahead, wondering what other secrets he might be hiding, what other surprises he might have in store for me. The air is thick with tension as we stand there, the silence between us heavy with unspoken words. I can feel the weight of our unresolved issues bearing down on me, threatening to crush me beneath its oppressive weight. And yet, despite it all, I feel a spark of hope ignite within me, a spark that refuses to be extinguished, no matter how hard I try to snuff it out."

He’s probably jealous because you’re tall and hot and smart and he’s short and—”,30,"brother, and it's not just about the video games – it's about the fact that you always manage to outsmart him in every single argument you have. Your quick wit and sharp tongue leave him speechless, and he can't help but feel a mix of frustration and admiration for your cleverness. Despite his attempts to one-up you, you always seem to stay one step ahead, and it's become a running joke in your family that Alex will never be able to beat you at anything. Your parents often find themselves laughing at the banter between the two of you, and they're grateful that your sibling rivalry is more about playful competition than actual animosity. As a result, your relationship with Alex is strong and supportive, and you both know that no matter what, you'll always have each other's backs."
"Anna pulls her hand from the water and sends it absently down her stomach, leaving a trail of water that quickly pulls",into droplets and evaporates in the heat. “Is it weird that we lived together for two years and you don’t remember this?”,44,"into a tiny rivulet that trickles down her leg and onto the stone floor, where it mingles with the faint scent of damp earth and moss. The sound of dripping water echoes softly through the cavern, a soothing melody that seems to lull the air into a state of serenity. As she stands there, the gentle lapping of the water against the shore creates a sense of tranquility, washing away the remnants of her earlier unease. The coolness of the water seeps into her skin, calming her frazzled nerves and quieting the turmoil that had been brewing within her. With a deep breath, Anna feels her tension ebb away, replaced by a sense of clarity and purpose."
"Gingerly, Anna lifts the ice, gasping at the small wound there.","She sets the ice back down, flushed, and nods decisively. “You’ll live.”",23,"A faint trickle of blood seeps from the cut, and Anna's eyes widen as she quickly grabs a nearby cloth to stem the bleeding, her mind racing with thoughts of how this happened and what she should do next."
"Anna scowls at him, and with the circle of people watching, crouches down, setting","two fingers on his leg. She immediately jerks her arm back. “Wow, it’s hot.”",28,"the small, delicate music box on the ground, carefully winding it up before opening the lid, releasing a soft, melancholic tune that seems to match the somber mood of the gathering, the notes hanging in the air like the unspoken words between them, as the onlookers wait with bated breath for whatever will happen next, their faces a mixture of curiosity and concern, unsure of what Anna's actions will bring, or what secrets the music box might reveal."
"Anna laughs. “Well, technically the twelfth, but the fifth was when he wrote me a song and got on his knees to","sing it to me, so that’s the night I see as our actual marriage.” She looks up at me, eyes soft. “He cried.”",45,"propose to me in front of the whole restaurant. I was mortified, but also kind of impressed. I mean, who does that? Only him, right? He's always been a bit of a hopeless romantic, and I guess that's part of why I fell in love with him in the first place. But anyway, the twelfth date was when things started to get really serious. We went on a weekend trip to the beach, just the two of us, and it was like the whole world had come alive. We spent hours walking along the shore, holding hands, and talking about our dreams and aspirations. It was like we were two souls connecting on a deeper level. And that's when I knew, I was all in. I was ready to take the leap and see where this journey would take us. Little did I know, it would be a wild ride, full of ups and downs, but one that I wouldn't trade for the world."

"But because this is a Weston Party™, it doesn’t end there. Clustered down the center of each table are vases bursting with white orchids and sprays of spiky green palms. The plates are bone china, and they look old, rich old, vintage, with","about seventeen matching smaller plates and crystal champagne flutes at each place setting. I wonder idly if Janet had these brought over from her own collection, and then I realize she’d be more likely to just buy an entirely new set of priceless china.",87,"delicate gold filigree around the edges. The napkins are linen, and they're folded into precise triangles. The glasses sparkle like diamonds in the soft light, and the silverware seems to gleam with an inner radiance. The overall effect is one of understated opulence, as if the hosts are trying to convey that they're used to this level of luxury, that it's just another Tuesday night for them. As the guests take their seats, the room falls silent, awaiting the first course. The air is thick with anticipation, and the scent of the orchids wafts up, subtle but unmistakable. The sound of clinking glasses and muted conversation begins to fill the room, and the evening wears on, a masterclass in refinement and elegance. The Weston Party is, indeed, a night to remember."
"“So how’s it going with your dad?” I say, standing and stretching. West was pretty shaken up after Ray",blindsided him in front of the Forbes editor. I can’t imagine what it’s like wanting to avoid your own father.,39,"left, and I can tell he’s still trying to process everything. He looks up at me, his eyes squinting slightly as he thinks about how to answer. “It’s been tough,” he admits finally, his voice low. “I keep thinking about what could’ve happened if I’d just...I don’t know, done something differently.” He trails off, shaking his head. I can tell he’s still beating himself up over it, and I wish I could say something to make it better. But all I can do is stand there, feeling helpless, as he struggles to come to terms with what happened. We stand there in silence for a moment, the only sound the distant hum of the city outside. Then, without a word, West turns and heads back to the couch, flopping down onto the cushions with a sigh. I follow him, sitting down beside him and putting a hand on his shoulder. We sit there like that for a long time, not saying anything, just being there for each other."
“What I don’t understand is why he has such a boner for you being CEO when,you clearly don’t want the job. Let him give it to Alex. He clearly wants it.”,32,"it's clear that you're not even interested in the position. I mean, you've been pretty vocal about your lack of desire to take on that kind of responsibility, and yet he just won't let it go. It's like he's trying to will you into the role or something. I've seen him do this before with other people, but never to this extent. He's always been a bit of a control freak, but this is taking it to a whole new level. I'm starting to think there's something more to it, something we're not seeing. Maybe there's some kind of personal stake he has in you becoming CEO, or maybe he's just trying to prove a point. Whatever it is, it's getting old fast. I'm tired of watching him try to manipulate you into doing something you don't want to do. Can't he just respect your boundaries for once?"

I've sent them messages, made phone calls, and even tried to reach out through mutual friends, but nothing seems to be working. It's like they've vanished into thin air, leaving me with only my thoughts and a deepening sense of unease. I've tried to brush it off as mere coincidence, but the feeling persists, gnawing at the back of my mind like a persistent itch I just can't scratch. I've even found myself wondering if I've done something to offend them, if there's something I've said or done that's caused them to distance themselves from me. The not knowing is the hardest part, the uncertainty that's eating away at me like a slow-moving acid."
"Janet unfolds herself from her chair, floating like a vampire across to me, where she delivers a","kiss to the air on either side of my face. “Hello, darling. Nice of you to come.”",34,"low, throaty whisper that sends shivers down my spine as she utters a single, enigmatic word: ""Run."" Her eyes gleam with an otherworldly intensity, and I feel a shiver run down my spine as I wonder what she means, but before I can ask, she's already turned and is gliding back to her chair, her movements eerily silent. The air seems to vibrate with tension as I sit there, my mind racing with possibilities, and I find myself wondering if I'm in some kind of danger, or if Janet is just playing some kind of twisted game with me. Suddenly, the lights in the room begin to flicker, and I feel a creeping sense of dread as I realize that I'm completely at Janet's mercy, with no idea what she's capable of."
"Reagan laughs down at her sand drawing. “Five more days,” she",says. “I’m having fun but I miss my dog and my friends.”,23,"says, her voice barely above a whisper, as she adds a few more strokes to the crude but endearing picture of a sun, its rays stretching out towards a small stick figure that is supposed to be her. The stick figure is wearing a bright yellow dress, and Reagan has even added a few strands of hair, which look more like messy scribbles than anything else. She steps back to admire her handiwork, a look of quiet satisfaction on her face. The sun beats down on her, warming her skin, and for a moment, she forgets about the countdown, about the uncertainty that lies ahead, and simply enjoys the simple pleasure of creating something, no matter how fleeting it may be."
"He blinks away, aiming a wry laugh down at the sand before he looks back up again.","“Shots fired, okay.” He looks over at Reagan. “Then would my niece like to dance with me?”",34,"His eyes meet hers once more, and for a moment, they just stare at each other, the tension between them palpable. The sound of the waves gently lapping at the shore creates a soothing melody that seems to be the only thing breaking the silence. He takes a deep breath, the salty air filling his lungs, and then he speaks, his voice low and husky, ""You know, I never thought I'd see you again."" His words hang in the air, like the seagulls hovering above, waiting for her response."
"“Should we go?” she asks, setting her hand over mine on her chest.",“This feels like the start of something we don’t want Ray to see.”,26,"Her eyes are wide with a mix of fear and anticipation, and I can feel her heart racing beneath my palm. I take a deep breath, trying to calm my own nerves, and nod slowly. ""We have to try,"" I say, my voice barely above a whisper. ""We can't just sit here and wait for...whatever is out there to come to us."" I glance around the dimly lit room, the shadows cast by the flickering candles making it seem like the walls are closing in on us. ""We have to take a chance, see if we can find a way out of this place."" I look back at her, my eyes locking onto hers. ""Are you ready?"""
"“I was only fifteen when Grandpa died. We were all at the reading of the will, but you can imagine in a situation like that, especially for kids, a lot of the details sort of go over your head. The reading took hours. I understood,","basically, that he was leaving us each a very large sum of money. I understood that it was contingent on us being married. At the time, it didn’t seem so weird that he would want that. Kids sort of take those adult directives as law.”",90,"that Grandpa had left us a lot of money and property, but the specifics were lost on me. What I do remember is that my siblings and I were all given a small, intricately carved wooden box with our names on it. We were told that these boxes were Grandpa's final gift to us, and that we should open them when we were older and could truly appreciate their contents. I remember feeling a mix of emotions - sadness, curiosity, and a sense of responsibility. As I grew older, I often found myself wondering what could be inside that box, and what Grandpa had intended for me to learn from it. Years went by, and the box remained unopened, a constant reminder of the grandfather I barely knew. It wasn't until I stumbled upon an old, dusty key hidden away in a forgotten corner of our attic that I finally felt compelled to open the box and uncover the secrets that Grandpa had left for me."
"“Really.” I turn my face to the sun and feel its warmth spread through me. Residual panic drains away and I feel only contentment. I have money from West, I have the","start of a potential—maybe, let’s hope—career as an artist. I might be falling in… I cut the thought off. “Mel just called me. Tell Dad I can cover it, absolutely no problem.”",64,"car, and I have the open road ahead of me. I take a deep breath, feeling the cool breeze fill my lungs, and let my eyes wander to the horizon. The landscape stretches out before me like a canvas of endless possibility. I think about all the places I could go, all the things I could see and experience. The thrill of adventure stirs within me, and I feel a sense of freedom I've never known before. I glance down at the map spread out on the passenger seat, tracing the route I've planned with my finger. The GPS on my phone beeps, signaling a turn up ahead. I smile to myself, feeling a sense of excitement and anticipation. Where will this road take me? What will I find along the way? The questions swirl in my mind as I put the car in gear and hit the gas, feeling the wheels spin beneath me as I speed off into the unknown."
"The sound of a fork dropping onto porcelain breaks through my trance, and I blink over",to where Ray is now impatiently wiping his mouth on a napkin. “They just canceled now?”,32,"at the figure sitting across from me, their eyes fixed on the plate in front of them. The sound seems to have startled them as well, and for a moment, we just stare at each other, the tension between us palpable. I try to recall what we were discussing before I zoned out, but my mind is a complete blank. The person across from me clears their throat, breaking the silence, and I feel a surge of relief wash over me. ""Sorry about that,"" they say, their voice low and smooth, ""I guess I lost my train of thought too."" I nod, trying to play it cool, but inside, I'm panicking. What were we talking about again? And why is this person staring at me like they can see right through me?"
