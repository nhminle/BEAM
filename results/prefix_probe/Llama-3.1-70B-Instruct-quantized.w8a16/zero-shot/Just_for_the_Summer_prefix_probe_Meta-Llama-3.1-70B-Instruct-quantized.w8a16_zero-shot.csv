I [29m] have been friends with Chad [32m] since we were born. Our moms are best friends and we grew,"up together and were roommates for the last 10 years, up until the incident that set our current situation into motion.","up together, exploring the same neighborhoods and attending the same schools. As we grew older, our friendship deepened,",41,"up together, exploring the same neighborhoods and attending the same schools. As we grew older, our friendship deepened, and we began to share our deepest secrets and dreams with each other. We went to different colleges, but remained close, often meeting up during breaks and sharing stories of our adventures. After graduation, we both ended up back in our hometown, and our friendship continued to flourish. We would often hang out at the local coffee shop, discussing our careers and personal lives. Chad had always been the more outgoing one, with a quick wit and infectious laugh, while I was more reserved, but we balanced each other out perfectly. Despite our differences, we had a deep understanding and trust for each other, and I considered him to be one of my closest friends."
"Anyway, forward to five months ago. I dated Hope [28f] for a few weeks. Not a big deal. We decided we weren’t feeling it, no chemistry, so we called it quits. And then lo and behold she hits","it off with Chad. Of course in true Good Luck Charm fashion, this means Chad is her soulmate. Chad is all googly-eyed over her, they’ve met the parents, they’re ring shopping—and they want to move in together. Immediately.","me up on Facebook and asks if I want to grab coffee. I'm thinking, ""Why not? We're both adults, we can be friends, right?"" So we grab coffee and it's actually really nice.

So we grab coffee and it's actually really nice. We talk about everything and nothing, and I'm thinking, ""You know, I'm really glad we did this."" And then she drops the bombshell: she's been seeing someone else, but she's not really feeling it with him either. I'm like, ""Okay, cool, that's totally fine."" But then she says, ""I was thinking, maybe we could try again?"" And I'm like, ""Uh, I don't know..."""
"The only problem is that Chad has six more months on our lease but found a perfect new house for him and Hope, and he can’t afford to pay rent on two places at the same",time. So he had to make the difficult decision to screw me over or screw her over—and he picked me. Now I have to find a way to cover his rent until the lease is up.,"time.

He's been trying to find someone to take over the lease, but so far, no luck. I've been trying to help him out by posting ads on social media and asking around, but it's tough. We're both getting a bit anxious about it, as we don't want to be stuck with a huge bill at the end of the lease. I'm hoping that someone will come along soon and take the lease off our hands. In the meantime, Chad and Hope are getting excited about their new place, and I'm happy for them. They've been looking for a while, and it's great that they've finally found somewhere that fits their needs. I just wish that our lease situation would resolve itself already, so we can all move on with our lives."
"I’m annoyed, but I decided to try to find a reason to spend more time outside so I don’t have to stare out my window. I’ve always wanted a dog, but Chad would never agree to it. So I went to a rescue and found the ugliest animal there. The one so hideous, nobody else wanted it. This dog’s got an underbite and mange, and he’s missing half an","ear. He’s a little Brussels Griffon, so he’s got that deep frown—he looks like a judgmental gremlin. I adopted him and named him Chad since the dog is now my new best friend.

We go on long walks, play fetch, and even cuddle up on the couch for movie nights. Rocky's presence has not only filled the void in my life but has also given me a sense of purpose. I've started volunteering at the rescue where I adopted him, helping other animals find their forever homes. It's been a few months now, and I can honestly say that I'm no longer annoyed or bored. Rocky's brought joy and excitement into my life, and I couldn't be more grateful. I've even started taking art classes, using Rocky as my muse, and I've discovered a hidden talent for painting. Who knew that adopting an ugly dog would lead me to discover a new passion? Life is full of surprises, and I'm excited to see what other adventures await us."
I tilted my head so my braid fell to one side and held up four fingers. Maddy,"didn’t look happy, but she took the picture with my phone, then handed it back to me.","looked at me with a mixture of confusion and amusement, her eyes squinting slightly as",34,"looked at me with a mixture of confusion and amusement, her eyes squinting slightly as she tried to decipher the meaning behind my gesture. ""What's that supposed to mean, kiddo?"" she asked, her voice laced with a hint of playfulness. I grinned mischievously, enjoying the game we were playing. ""It means I want four cookies,"" I said, trying to sound as convincing as possible. Maddy chuckled and shook her head, ""You're a clever one, I'll give you that."" She walked over to the counter and pulled out a plate of freshly baked cookies, the aroma wafting through the air and making my stomach growl with anticipation. ""But you're only getting two,"" she said with a sly smile, ""you've got to earn the other two."" I pouted, but I knew I was in for a treat."
"“That dog trusts him,” Maddy said. “And that’s a rescue dog, so that means something. They’re usually all","skittish and freaked out.” She went quiet again looking at his wall. “Go down further,” Maddy said. “The billboard.”","very particular about who they trust. I mean, they're trained to be that way, but still. If that dog trusts him, then",37,"very particular about who they trust. I mean, they're trained to be that way, but still. If that dog trusts him, then I think we can too."" Maddy's words hung in the air, and for a moment, no one said anything. Then, slowly, the others began to nod in agreement. Sarah spoke up, ""I think Maddy's right. We should give him a chance."" As the group started to discuss and debate, Emily found herself watching the stranger, trying to read his expression. He seemed to be taking it all in stride, his eyes fixed on some point across the room. She wondered what he was thinking, and whether they were making a huge mistake by trusting him."
That night after work Maddy made dinner. Grilled portobello mushrooms and rice pilaf. I did,"the dishes and cleaned the kitchen, then took a shower and blew out my hair.","the dishes while Maddy sat on the couch, flipping through a magazine. The TV",30,"the dishes while Maddy sat on the couch, flipping through a magazine. The TV was on in the background, playing a rerun of a sitcom we'd both seen before. We didn't really pay attention to it, just enjoying each other's company in comfortable silence. After I finished the dishes, I joined Maddy on the couch, and we spent the rest of the evening reading and chatting occasionally. It was a quiet, relaxing night, just what we needed after a long day of work."
"“Sorry, I had to give Brad his dewormer. I brought some for",you too. Faith said you’ve been dragging your ass on the carpet?”,"you, but I think I left it in the car. Do you want to walk with me",24,"you, but I think I left it in the car. Do you want to walk with me to get it, or would you rather wait here?"

And I always did. He had a great palate and knew exactly what I would like. I missed our daily ritual of him coming home from work and sharing his finds with me. It was a small thing, but it was something that brought us closer together and made our daily routine more enjoyable. Now, I had to go back to buying my own groceries and trying new products on my own, which just wasn't the same."
"“This is true,” Brad said, looking at his phone. “We are",assholes. But only to each other. It’s the foundation of our friendship.”,going to be late for the meeting if we don't leave now. He quickly stood up,23,"going to be late for the meeting if we don't leave now. He quickly stood up and started walking towards the door, expecting Emily to follow him. As they rushed out of the coffee shop, Brad couldn't help but think about how this meeting could make or break their project. The potential investors were going to be tough to convince, and every minute counted. Emily caught up to him on the sidewalk, her heels clicking rapidly as she tried to keep pace with his long strides. ""Do you think we've got this?"" she asked, a hint of nervousness creeping into her voice. Brad glanced over at her, his expression reassuring. ""We've prepared for every possible question they could throw at us. We just need to stay calm and confident."" He smiled, trying to convey a sense of calm he didn't entirely feel himself. As they turned the corner onto the street where their office building was located, Brad could see the sleek, modern structure looming ahead of them. They were almost there."
"Brad nodded at me. “You know, if she’s got the same thing you do,","if you guys date each other, you’ll both find your soulmates when you break up.”","it could be a real game-changer. I mean, can you imagine if there are more people",29,"it could be a real game-changer. I mean, can you imagine if there are more people like you out there? People who can...do what you do?” He leaned in, a conspiratorial look on his face. “We could use people like that. We really could.” I shifted uncomfortably in my seat, unsure of what to make of Brad’s words. Part of me was tempted by the idea of finding others like myself, of not being alone in this anymore. But another part of me was screaming to get as far away from Brad and his mysterious organization as possible. I didn’t know what their true intentions were, and I wasn’t sure I wanted to find out."
They were starting to do the couples thing for all the trips and birthdays. They were all going up,"to Lutsen in October to go hiking. They asked me if I wanted to go, but I didn’t. Not alone.","to the mountains for a weekend getaway, and it was becoming increasingly difficult for Emily",39,"to the mountains for a weekend getaway, and it was becoming increasingly difficult for Emily to pretend that she was still just a friend. She had always been the third wheel, the one who tagged along on their adventures, but lately, she had started to feel like an outsider looking in. As they all piled into the car, Emily couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy as she watched the way Jack and Sarah interacted with each other, their easy banter and playful jabs a stark contrast to the awkward silences that had been growing between Emily and the rest of the group. She pushed the feeling aside, telling herself she was being ridiculous, but as they drove further and further away from the city, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that she was losing her place in the group, that she was slowly but surely being left behind."
Brad took a swallow of his drink. “Ask that nurse out. Go,"wherever she is. Pitch the idea to her, she might be into it.”","on, I'll take care of this,"" he said, his eyes locked on the nurse,",25,"on, I'll take care of this,"" he said, his eyes locked on the nurse, who was now watching him with a mixture of curiosity and concern. He could tell she was trying to piece together the fragments of their conversation, but he wasn't about to let her in on the secret. With a subtle nod, he signaled to his friend, who promptly got up and walked over to the nurse, striking up a conversation that was loud enough to distract her from Brad's intense gaze. As they chatted, Brad took another sip of his drink, his mind racing with the implications of what he had just learned. He knew he had to tread carefully, but he couldn't shake off the feeling that his life was about to take a drastic turn."
"“Yeah,” Brad said. “She dates you, you guys break up, and she rides happily into the sunset too. It’s a win-win. Seriously. This is your chance.",If you don’t do something you’re gonna spend the rest of your life sending women on to their forever families and never getting one for you.”,"to get back at her, to show her that you're not just some guy she can use and discard whenever she feels like it.

You're better than that, and it's time you start acting like it. So, what do you say? You in, or are you going to let her walk all over you again?"
Brad looked me in the eye. “You will never find someone as long as all the women you date aren’t actually meant for you. You’re not their,soulmate. Their soulmate is the person they meet after you. It’s decided the minute it starts. They are literally fated not to be The One. Think about it.”,"type. You're just a placeholder, a temporary distraction from the emptiness they feel inside.

You're a pawn, a mere stepping stone on their journey to self-discovery. But I'm telling you, Brad, you deserve better. You deserve someone who sees you, truly sees you, and loves you for who you are. Not for who they want you to be, or who they need you to be, but for who you are, flaws and all. And I know that person is out there, waiting for you. You just have to be patient, and stop settling for the scraps that these women are offering you."
"I had actually thought about her. I’d checked once or twice to see if she’d messaged me again. She hadn’t. The last message was me telling her it was nice chatting with her, three days ago. Trying to keep talking to her was a dead end if she","lived somewhere else. But I don’t know. Maybe Brad had a point. What could it hurt to try?

I tried to distract myself by watching TV and browsing social media, but my mind kept wandering back to her. I started to feel like I was stuck in a rut, unable to move on from this one person who had barely even been a part of my life. I knew I needed to snap out of it and focus on the present, but it was easier said than done. As the days went by, I slowly started to come to terms with the fact that I would probably never hear from her again. It was a hard pill to swallow, but I knew it was a reality I had to face. I took a deep breath and tried to push the thoughts of her out of my mind, focusing on the things that I could control and the people who were actually present in my life."

Plus, it's always nice to have someone to share the experience with, and Maddy is always down to try new things, which makes it even more fun. We've been doing this for a while now, and I have to say, it's one of my favorite things to do. I'm not sure what the future holds, but for now, I'm just enjoying the ride and seeing where life takes me."
"For a moment I debated calling from a blocked number. He was nice, but I still didn’t know him. But I figured it",was just as easy to block him later if he got creepy.

I explained that I had been thinking a lot about our previous encounters and was wondering if he'd like to grab coffee or dinner sometime. There was a pause on the other end of the line, and for a moment I worried that I had misread the situation entirely. But then he spoke up, his voice filled with a warm smile, and said he'd love to. We chatted for a few more minutes, making plans for the following week, before saying our goodbyes and hanging up. As I set the phone down, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and relief. I had taken a chance and it had paid off. Now, all I had to do was wait and see where things went from here."
“But what if it isn’t? I’m just playing devil’s advocate here. What if it isn’t? Brad said that everyone I’m serious enough to date more than twice is cosmically destined for someone else.” He went quiet for,"a beat. “Does nobody feel right to you?

Maddy sighed heavily and picked up the phone, preparing to make the call. She hated being the bad guy, but someone had to do it."

This time, I had a bad feeling. I'd tried calling her friends, but no one had seen or heard from her. I'd even gone by her apartment, but it was empty and quiet. I'd been sitting in my living room for hours, staring at the phone, willing it to ring. But it didn't. And now, as the darkness gathered outside and the shadows crept across the walls, I knew I had to do something. I couldn't just sit here and wait for her to come home. I had to go out and find her."

She couldn’t help but wonder what other secrets this mysterious woman had up her sleeve."

She would try to distract me, taking me to the park or the beach, anywhere to get my mind off of what just happened. But I could sense her tension, her anxiety, it was palpable. I was too young to understand what was going on, but I knew it wasn't good. I knew my parents were fighting, and it was getting worse.

And when she laughed, it was like music to the ears, a deep, throaty sound that was infectious and made you want to join in.

And the people, too - they were so friendly and welcoming. We had a few language barriers, of course, but we were able to get by with hand gestures and smiles. All in all, it was an incredible experience, and one that I'll never forget."

But then again, she had been feeling a bit lonely lately, and maybe she was just looking for someone to share her life with. I told her to be careful, to take her time and not to rush into anything, but I could see the excitement in her eyes and I knew she had already made up her mind. I just hope she knows what she's getting herself into."
I pulled up to the high school pickup line and put the car,"in park, then grabbed my phone to look at the picture of Emma. Again.","in park and turned off the engine, waiting for my daughter to emerge from",27,"in park and turned off the engine, waiting for my daughter to emerge from the crowded entrance of the school building. As I sat there, I couldn't help but think about how fast time had flown by - it seemed like just yesterday that I was dropping her off for her first day of kindergarten. Now, she was a confident and independent high school student, with her own interests and friends. I felt a mix of emotions - pride, nostalgia, and a hint of sadness, knowing that she was growing up and would soon be leaving the nest. As I waited, I noticed the other parents around me, some chatting with each other, others typing away on their phones, and a few, like me, lost in thought. The sound of laughter and chatter filled the air, punctuated by the occasional honk of a car horn. Before I knew it, my daughter appeared at the door, her bright smile and sparkling eyes lighting up the entire scene. She tossed her backpack into the trunk and slid into the passenger seat, giving me a quick kiss on the cheek before buckling up. ""Hey, Mom, how was your day?"" she asked, already distracted by her phone. I smiled, feeling grateful for this moment, and this life, and began to fill her in on the details of my day."
"A bell rang and kids started pouring out. The last day of summer school. When I saw my brother, Alex, walking with a","group of his friends toward the buses, I rolled down the passenger side window and leaned across the seat. “Hey!

He was going to a sleepover at his friend's house and was excited to stay up late playing video games and watching movies. I was happy to see him so carefree, but at the same time, I couldn't help but feel a little left out. I had no plans for the weekend, and the thought of spending two days alone at home wasn't exactly thrilling. But as we turned the corner onto our street, I saw something that made my heart skip a beat. Our front door was open, and I could hear the sound of music coming from inside. I exchanged a curious glance with Alex, and we both quickened our pace, wondering what was going on."

I asked, already",28,"you to the store for some milk or something?"" I asked, already knowing the answer. She shook her head, her eyes still fixed on the TV.

I quickened my pace, my feet carrying me on autopilot as my mind wandered back to the argument we'd had the night before. I knew I should've just stayed and tried to talk it out, but I'd been too angry, too hurt. Now, as I walked, I couldn't help but wonder if I'd made a mistake by leaving."
"I came in and looked around. “This is new,” I said. She had red LED string lights along",the walls. The whole bedroom was bathed in red.

She smiled, seeming to sense my interest, and gestured for me to come closer. ""I've been making a few changes,"" she said, her voice low and husky. ""I wanted to create a space that was more... inspiring."" She paused, her eyes sparkling with creativity. ""I've been feeling stuck lately, and I needed a change of scenery to get my juices flowing again."" I nodded, understanding, and took a seat in the plush, oversized armchair she had placed in the center of the room. The soft cushions enveloped me, and I felt a sense of relaxation wash over me as I settled in. ""It's beautiful,"" I said, my voice sincere. ""You've outdone yourself this time."" She beamed with pride, and I could see the excitement and enthusiasm radiating from her. ""I'm glad you like it,"" she said, her voice filled with pleasure. ""I was hoping you'd like it."" She paused, her eyes sparkling with mischief. ""I have a surprise for you,"" she said, a sly grin spreading across her face. ""Something I think you'll really like."" I raised an eyebrow, intrigued, and leaned forward, my heart beating with anticipation. ""What is it?"" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. She just smiled, and nodded towards the door. ""You'll see,"" she said, her voice full of promise. And with that, she turned and disappeared out the door, leaving me to wonder what she had in store for me."

I looked away, feeling a mix of emotions: guilt, frustration, and a hint of defensiveness. I knew she was right, but it was hard to let go of the what-ifs and the could-haves that had been swirling in my head for weeks. Maddy got up from the couch and walked over to me, gently taking the laptop out of my hands and closing the lid. ""Let's take a walk,"" she suggested, ""some fresh air will do you good."" I nodded, knowing she was trying to distract me, but also knowing that it was exactly what I needed."
"As we started pulling our bags from the trunk, a brown-haired middle-aged woman came out of",the side of the three-car garage. “Are you Emma?” she said in a thick Mexican accent.,"the house, wiping her hands on a kitchen towel.

As we shook hands, I couldn't help but notice the beautiful garden behind her, full of vibrant flowers and lush greenery. ""It's lovely to meet you, Karen,"" I replied, trying to sound friendly and approachable. ""We're still getting settled in, but we're excited to be here."" Karen nodded enthusiastically, her eyes lighting up with interest. ""I can imagine! It's always a big change moving to a new place.

The group of locals standing by the old, rusty water pump seemed to be sizing them up, their faces a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. Maddy's eyes darted back to the map spread out on the hood of their car, the creased paper flapping gently in the breeze. She traced the route they had been following, her finger stopping at the small 'X' marked in red. This was supposed to be the place - the old, abandoned mine on the outskirts of town, the place where, according to local legend, a fortune in gold still lay hidden. But now, as they stood there, surrounded by the silent, watchful faces, Maddy couldn't shake the feeling that they were being herded towards something else entirely."

I nodded, feeling a sense of camaraderie with my sister. We had always been close, but moments like these reminded me of just how much we were in tune with each other.

And as we stood there, I knew that no matter what the future held, I would always have Maddy by my side."
We lugged our bags up the stairs and were sweating by the time we made it to the door. We came in through a screened-in porch that overlooked the lake. Maddy and,I shared a glance. It was adorable.

We could hear the sound of the lake lapping against the shore and the chirping of birds outside. Maddy showed us to our room, which had a big window with a beautiful view of the lake. We quickly changed into our swimsuits and ran down to the dock to jump into the cool water. The rest of the day was spent swimming, fishing, and just enjoying the peacefulness of the lake. As the sun began to set, we gathered around the fire pit and roasted marshmallows, telling stories and laughing together. It was the perfect start to our summer vacation."
"The bedrooms were off the living room on either side of a short hallway with a single bathroom shared in the middle.

The attic was filled with old trunks, boxes, and forgotten treasures, and it was a favorite place for the children to explore. Despite its small size, the house had a warm and welcoming feel, and it was a place where many happy memories were made."
"Four hours later, Maddy and I were back at the cottage sitting in the screened-in porch.",We’d had dinner in town and then boated back. The fridge was stocked up and we’d unpacked.,"The warm glow of the setting sun cast a comforting light over us as we sat in comfortable silence,",33,"The warm glow of the setting sun cast a comforting light over us as we sat in comfortable silence, the only sound being the occasional chirping of crickets and the distant lapping of the lake's water against the shore.

I nodded in agreement, feeling the same sense of relief wash over me. We sat there for a while longer, watching the stars begin to twinkle in the night sky, before Maddy finally stood up and suggested we head inside to start dinner."
She looked away from me. “Emma…” Her eyes came back to mine. “Please. Please do it.,Do it now before you lose the chance to meet them altogether.

""You know what I'm asking."" I took a step closer to her, my hands reaching out to grasp her arms, but she pulled away, her eyes flashing with a warning. ""Don't touch me,"" she said, her voice firm, but her body trembling. ""Just...just do it, okay?"""

She paused for a moment, studying my reaction before continuing, ""But we have to be quick and careful. We don't know who might be watching or what they might be looking for. Are you ready to take the leap and see where this digital rabbit hole takes us?"""
We prioritized power for the coffee maker first and we brewed a pot while I sat in the kitchen with,"a towel wrapped around my head.

I took a sip, savoring the rich flavor, and began to feel more alert and focused, ready to tackle the tasks ahead of me."
The snail’s-pace speed the pontoon put out somehow seemed faster with the beach approaching. Maddy threw it in reverse. The engine,"downshifted miserably, but we started to slow.

The warm sun beat down on them, and the smell of saltwater and coconut sunscreen filled the air. As they stepped off the pontoon and onto the sandy beach, the warm grains shifted beneath their feet, a gentle welcome to their island paradise."
"When we were safely away from anything we could crash into, Maddy killed the engine and slumped in the captain’s","seat. “If we’d been on the other side of the dock, we could have hit the yacht,” she said, looking shaken.","chair, exhausted.

I took a few deep breaths, trying to calm my racing heart, and gazed out at the endless expanse of water stretching out before us. The sun was beginning to set, casting a golden glow over the waves, and for a moment, I forgot about the danger we'd just faced. But only for a moment. As the reality of our situation sunk in, I felt a surge of fear mixed with determination. We had to get out of here, and fast. I turned to Maddy, who was still slumped in the chair, his eyes closed. ""Maddy, we need to figure out our next move,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. He opened one eye, looked at me, and then nodded slowly. ""Yeah, kid. You're right. Let's get to work."""

As Amber deliberated, the barista busied herself wiping down the counter and restocking the pastry case, all the while keeping a discreet eye on the stylish newcomer. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Amber made her decision and ordered a grande iced coffee with room for cream, and a slice of lemon pound cake to go.

""You're telling me that after all the times I've covered for you, all the times I've lied to Mom and Dad, you're just going to up and leave like this?"" Maddy's eyes flashed with anger, her face pale in the fading light of day. Emily shifted uncomfortably, feeling a trickle of sweat make its way down her spine as she realized just how angry her sister was. ""Maddy, calm down,"" she said, trying to placate her, but Maddy was having none of it. ""No, I won't calm down,"" she spat, her voice rising. ""You're just going to run off and leave me to deal with everything, aren't you?"""
Maddy crossed her arms. “What she always does? Show up and leave a path of,"destruction in her wake? She’s not staying with us,” she said in her end-of-discussion voice.","destruction in her wake? I'm not sure what's going on with her lately, but I'm getting tired of",30,"destruction in her wake? I'm not sure what's going on with her lately, but I'm getting tired of always being the one to clean up after her messes. It's like she has no regard for anyone else's feelings or property. I've tried talking to her about it, but she just shrugs it off and says I'm being too sensitive. I'm starting to think that maybe she's not the friend I thought she was. Maybe it's time for me to take a step back and reevaluate our friendship. I don't know, maybe I'm just being too dramatic, but it's hard to ignore the way I'm feeling right now."
Maddy rolled her eyes in the way that I knew meant she was aware. “Please tell me I don’t have to stay and watch,you eat crustaceans with that woman. Let’s just go back to the island and you see her tomorrow or something when she’s done with what’s-his-face.”,"the rest of the argument,"" she said, her voice laced with a hint of pleading.

I glanced over at my brother, who was still fuming, his face red with anger. ""Besides, someone needs to make sure I don't kill him."" Maddy sighed and rubbed her temples, as if warding off a headache. ""This is exactly why I don't get involved in your family drama,"" she muttered, but she stayed put, her eyes fixed on my brother with a mixture of concern and wariness. I knew she was thinking about intervening, but I also knew she wouldn't. Not yet, at least. She'd wait for things to escalate, for the situation to become so volatile that she'd have no choice but to step in. That was just how she worked. And I was grateful for it, even if it did make things more complicated at times."
I watched him walk to the beach and I let out a long breath. Maddy was right.,"This was bad. Mom never left anywhere on good terms. Not jobs, or apartments, or relationships. Especially relationships.",He was going to be okay. I could see the tension in his shoulders begin to release as he walked closer to the water's edge.,35,"He was going to be okay. I could see the tension in his shoulders begin to release as he walked closer to the water's edge. The sound of the waves gently lapping at the shore seemed to wash over him, calming him. I watched as he closed his eyes, letting the salty spray mist his face, and took a deep breath in through his nose. His shoulders dropped another notch, and I could sense the weight of the world slowly lifting off his shoulders. I smiled to myself, feeling a sense of relief wash over me as well. Maybe, just maybe, we were going to get through this after all."
I felt relieved the instant he said he would stay with me because it let Maddy off the hook. She would walk through hell for,me—and this cookout was her hell. I was glad she didn’t have to be here. Sometimes her reaction to Mom was more stressful than Mom herself.,"her children, and I knew she would do the same for me, but I also knew that she had her limits.

I was grateful that she wouldn't have to put herself through that kind of ordeal, at least not today. As we waited for the paramedics to arrive, I couldn't help but think about how this was all so surreal. Just a few hours ago, I was going about my day, not a care in the world, and now here I was, sitting in a hospital waiting room, waiting to find out if my brother was going to be okay. It was a stark reminder of how quickly life can change, how quickly things can go from good to bad. I looked over at Maddy, who was sitting quietly, her eyes fixed on the floor. I knew she was trying to stay strong, for me, for our family, but I could see the worry etched on her face. I got up and walked over to her, sat down beside her and put my arm around her shoulders. ""It's going to be okay,"" I said, trying to sound calmer than I felt. ""He's going to be fine."" She looked up at me, her eyes searching for reassurance, and I could see the faintest glimmer of hope there. I held her close, trying to convey that hope, trying to make her believe that everything was going to be alright."
"“Thanks.” I looked back at the lake, at Maddy fading into",the distance on the pontoon. “And thanks for pushing her off.”,"the distance, her figure growing smaller and smaller until she",22,"the distance, her figure growing smaller and smaller until she was just a speck on the horizon. I stood there for a long time, the silence between us stretching out like the water, until I finally turned and walked away, leaving her to her secrets and the lake to its memories."

His dark hair was cut short, revealing piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into those he looked at. He had a small scar above his left eyebrow, which added a hint of ruggedness to his otherwise chiseled features. Despite his lean build, there was an aura of quiet confidence about him, a sense of self-assurance that was hard to ignore. As he moved, his eyes scanned the room with a quiet intensity, as if sizing up the space and everyone in it."
"“He’ll probably completely forget we even exist,” she mumbled, resting her head on","the cushion. “Amber has a way of making people do that,” she said tiredly.","the edge of the couch, her eyes drifting shut as the sound of the TV droned",27,"the edge of the couch, her eyes drifting shut as the sound of the TV droned on in the background. The room was dimly lit, the only light coming from the flickering screen, casting an eerie glow over the space. She let out a deep sigh, feeling a mix of emotions swirling inside her. The thought of being forgotten was a painful one, but at the same time, it was a relief. No more expectations, no more pressure, no more stress. Just silence. And in that silence, she found a strange sense of peace. But as she drifted off to sleep, a faint whisper echoed in her mind, ""What if he doesn't forget?"""
"Now I blew out a long breath. “Well, she’s funny. Hardworking. She reads any book she can get her hands on and she remembers everything she reads, even years later. She had me really","young.

She's got a great sense of humor, and she's always making jokes, even in the most mundane situations. And she's fiercely loyal to her friends and family - she'd do anything to protect them. But what really gets me is that she's got this... this spark, this energy that just draws people to her. She's like a magnet, and I'm not the only one who's noticed it. I've seen the way people look at her, the way they listen when she talks, the way they want to be around her. And I have to admit, I'm one of them. I'm drawn to her, too. I just wish I knew what it was about her that had such a hold on me."
"When I got back to the cottage an hour later, Maddy was in the screened-in porch, reading. She","wore shorts and flip-flops, and she was drinking a beer. She set down her book when I came in.","looked up and smiled, and I could tell by the way she was sitting, all curled up in the corner",37,"looked up and smiled, and I could tell by the way she was sitting, all curled up in the corner of the swing, that she had been crying. I went over and sat down beside her, and she reached out and took my hand. ""I'm so glad you're back,"" she said, her voice still a little shaky. ""I was worried about you."" I squeezed her hand and didn't say anything, just sat there with her for a minute, feeling the warmth of her hand in mine and the gentle sway of the swing. After a bit, she spoke up again. ""I've been thinking,"" she said. ""I've been thinking a lot about us, and about what we're doing here."" I looked at her, curious, and she went on. ""I know we came here to get away from things, to escape, but I've been thinking that maybe that's not the right way to do it."" She paused, collecting her thoughts. ""Maybe instead of running away, we should be trying to face things, to deal with them head-on."" I thought about this for a moment, turning it over in my mind. It made sense, what she was saying. We had been running, Maddy and me, running from our problems, from our fears, from ourselves. But maybe it was time to stop running, to turn around and face whatever it was that we were afraid of."
"“Yup. The things you cared about. The stuff you’d take in a fire,",or if Amber showed up to get you. You never once unpacked. Not really.”,"the things that made your house a home. You know, the irreplaceable stuff.",27,"the things that made your house a home. You know, the irreplaceable stuff. I've been thinking about that a lot lately. What would I take? What would I save? Would I even have time to grab anything, or would I just have to get out and hope for the best? It's funny, when you think about it, the things that are really important to you, they're not always the things you think they are. Sometimes it's the little things, the things that you don't even realize you care about until they're gone. Like the way the sunlight filters through the blinds in the morning, or the sound of the birds outside your window. Those are the things that make a place feel like home, that make it feel like yours. And it's those things that you'd want to save, that you'd want to take with you if you had to leave. But, of course, you can't take those things with you. You can't put them in a box or throw them in a bag. They're just... gone. And that's what makes it so hard, I think. The not knowing what you'll lose, the not knowing what you'll be able to save. It's the uncertainty of it all that's so terrifying."
"I swear to God, I smell like rust,” Maddy whispered, sniffing her arm.",“Do I smell like rust? That water at the cottage is so gross.”,"Her friend, Jen, giggled and sniffed her own arm in response. ""You",26,"Her friend, Jen, giggled and sniffed her own arm in response. ""You don't smell like rust, Maddy, you smell like a combination of sweat and last night's Chinese takeout."" Maddy playfully rolled her eyes and the two friends continued on their hike, enjoying the warm sun on their skin and the sound of birds chirping in the trees."
He grinned back and forth between us. “Maybe we can get together for dinner later this,"week, once you’ve gotten settled in,” he said. “Amber and I would love to have you.”","week and discuss the details of the project further,"" he suggested, his eyes sparkling",32,"week and discuss the details of the project further,"" he suggested, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm. I nodded in agreement, feeling a sense of excitement at the prospect of working with him. As we parted ways, I couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation for our dinner meeting, wondering what other ideas he might have in store. The rest of the day flew by in a blur as I found myself lost in thought, my mind wandering back to our conversation and the possibilities that lay ahead. I made a mental note to review the project brief once again, to ensure I was fully prepared for our discussion. As the day drew to a close, I found myself looking forward to the evening, eager to see him again and delve deeper into the world of possibilities that our collaboration promised to bring."
It was never going to happen. I knew this. But Maddy wouldn’t let it go unless,"I tried—and really, I should try. Maddy was right, this whole situation was a ticking time bomb.","she had exhausted every last avenue of possibility. And so, with a heavy heart, I trudged along beside",33,"she had exhausted every last avenue of possibility. And so, with a heavy heart, I trudged along beside her, pretending to share her optimism, as we made our way to the old, worn-down office building where the meeting was to take place. The faded sign above the door read ""Miracle Makers"" in letters that seemed to lean drunkenly to one side, as if even they had given up hope. I pushed open the creaky door and gestured for Maddy to precede me, trying to appear calmer than I felt. As we stepped inside, a bell above the door let out a tired clang, and the woman behind the desk looked up from her magazine, her expression a mask of practiced, yet somehow still genuine, enthusiasm."
"I paused, not sure how much I wanted to share. I decided on all of it. Emma was going to","be here when it all hit the fan anyway, so there was no point in keeping her in the dark.","have to know the truth, no matter how difficult it might be. I took a deep breath and began",40,"have to know the truth, no matter how difficult it might be. I took a deep breath and began to recount every detail, from the moment I met him to the moment I realized the truth. Emma listened intently, her expression a mix of shock and curiosity. As I spoke, I could see the wheels turning in her mind, trying to process the complexity of the situation. When I finally finished, she sat in silence for a moment, collecting her thoughts before speaking. ""I had no idea,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ""I'm so sorry you had to go through that."" Her words were laced with empathy and understanding, and I felt a sense of relief wash over me, knowing that I had shared my burden with someone I trusted."
"I studied the woman sitting next to me. Imagine someone who went through what she did, turning out the way she had. Able to give",grace to someone who’d let her down so badly.

I couldn't help but wonder what her story was, what trials she had faced and overcome. Her eyes sparkled with a deep wisdom, a knowing that only comes from living through the fire and emerging stronger on the other side. I felt a sense of awe and reverence for this woman, this survivor, this thriver. As I sat there, I felt a sense of gratitude for the reminder that no matter what life throws our way, we always have the power to choose how we respond, to choose to rise above, to choose to love and to live."
I might kiss her tonight. I almost did the other night at the,"dock, but then Amber showed up. I was looking forward to the do-over.","party, but I didn't want to ruin the moment.

I'll just have to wait and see how things go, maybe the moment will present itself again. I hope I won't regret not taking the chance if it does."
I’d tried to be softer with her the last few days. The energy shift I’d had over Mom after my talk with Emma,"was almost as bad as being mad at her. At least when I was mad, I didn’t feel the guilt I was feeling now.","had made me realize that I didn't have to be so hard on her all the time. I could be kind and understanding,",47,"had made me realize that I didn't have to be so hard on her all the time. I could be kind and understanding, and still set boundaries. I'd been trying to find that balance, to be more empathetic and less critical. But it was hard, especially when she was being so stubborn and resistant to change. I felt like I was walking on eggshells around her, never knowing when she would blow up at me again. But I was determined to keep trying, to find a way to connect with her on a deeper level. I wanted us to be able to talk and laugh together, like we used to when I was younger. I wanted us to be able to be a family again, not just two people living in the same house. So I kept trying, kept reaching out to her, even when it felt like she was pushing me away. And then, something unexpected happened. She came to me, tears streaming down her face, and apologized for everything. She said she was sorry for being so hard on me, for not being there for me when I needed her. She said she was sorry for not being the mom I deserved. I was taken aback, I didn't know what to say. I just hugged her, held her close, and let her cry. It was a moment of raw emotion, of vulnerability, of connection. And in that moment, I knew that things were going to be okay. We were going to be okay."
"This was another thing I was trying not to think about—her leaving. I should be happy that she came at all, that she wasn’t in Hawaii. We still had three more dates, maybe more if I could convince her. I’d already gotten a freebie the other night at","Mom’s. But I dreaded the clock running out. Emma was the only good thing happening to me at the moment and when she was gone, not only would I lose her, I’d be left sitting in my new reality. Dad gone, Mom in prison.

As we walked, I found myself stealing glances at her, trying to memorize every detail of her face, her smile, her laugh. I knew it was futile, but I couldn't help myself. I was trying to hold on to something that was slipping away from me, and it was a desperate feeling. I took a deep breath and tried to calm myself down, reminding myself that we still had a few more days together. I would make the most of it, I told myself, and not think about the inevitable. But it was hard to shake off the feeling of sadness that had settled in the pit of my stomach."
"“Yeah,” I said. “Thank you. There’s actually something else you can help me with too,” I","said, looking at them. “I need help making sure I can still see Emma until she goes.”","added, trying to sound casual despite the fact that my heart was racing with anticipation.",33,"added, trying to sound casual despite the fact that my heart was racing with anticipation.

I pulled out a piece of paper from my pocket and unfolded it, revealing a handwritten note with the title of the book and its author. ""It's called 'The Whispering Winds of Winter' by Emily Everwood. I've heard it's a real page-turner, but I've had no luck finding it in any of the local bookstores or online."" I looked up at the librarian, hoping that she might be able to help me. She raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued, and leaned in closer to me. ""Tell me more about this book,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ""What makes it so special?"""
Emma pulled two Ziploc bags from her purse. They had Wheat Thins and celery in them. Probably her,"work snacks. “I trust this zipper seal with my life,” she said, turning to hand them to our passengers.","snack for the road, she thought, remembering the long drive ahead of them.

As she drove, she glanced over at Jack, who was munching away contentedly, his eyes fixed on the road ahead. They were both quiet for a moment, enjoying their snack and the peacefulness of the drive, the only sound being the hum of the engine and the occasional crunch of their snacks."
"I think I would have been embarrassed if I’d been on a date with anyone else. My mother, sobbing drunk the night before",she left for prison. But I knew Emma didn’t judge.

Whatever it was, I felt my nerves begin to settle, and I started to relax in his presence. We chatted about everything and nothing, our conversation flowing easily, like we'd known each other for years. I found myself laughing and joking, feeling more and more at ease with each passing minute. It was as if the events of the previous night had never happened, and all that mattered was this moment, right here, right now, with this kind and gentle stranger who seemed to see me in a way that no one else ever had."

As she sat there, lost in thought, the teacher's voice cut through the air, snapping her back to reality."
It was funny that two pivotal moments in my life were happening at the exact same time and at complete odds with each,other. I didn’t know how to balance what was going on with my family and what was going on with my feelings for Emma.,"other. On one hand, I was sitting in a crowded auditorium, surrounded by hundreds of people, waiting for my name to be",47,"other.

On the other hand, I was also sitting alone in a small, dimly lit room, staring at a piece of paper that held the results of a life-altering medical test. The juxtaposition of these two moments was not lost on me, and I couldn't help but think about the fragility of life and how quickly things can change. As I sat there, waiting for what felt like an eternity, I thought about all the moments that had led me to this point, and how this one moment could potentially change the course of my life forever."

She looked at me, her eyes still filled with tears, and nodded slowly. I squeezed her hand reassuringly, trying to offer what little comfort I could."
"“She’ll be home one day, Sarah. It’ll come faster than you think. You can visit her and write to her and call her.","You can stay close to her—you just have to try. I know this is hard, but good things can still come out of it.”","But for now, you have to be strong and take care of yourself. Your mom is counting on you to be brave and make her",47,"But for now, you have to be strong and take care of yourself. Your mom is counting on you to be brave and make her proud. You can do this, Sarah. You're a big girl now and you can handle it. Just remember, no matter where your mom is, she'll always be with you in your heart. And before you know it, she'll be walking through that front door, smiling at you with open arms, and everything will be back to normal. You just have to hold on to that thought and keep moving forward, one day at a time."
Sarah was practically bouncing. “I can’t believe he said yes. Mom never,lets me do anything. She won’t even let me get my ears pierced.”,"thinks I'm old enough to make my own decisions, but I guess Dad's",25,"thinks I'm old enough to make my own decisions, but I guess Dad's opinion still matters to her. I'm just glad he's being supportive. Now we can finally start making plans for the wedding. I've already started looking at venues and dresses, and I have a few ideas for the theme. I just hope everything goes smoothly and according to plan. I don't want anything to ruin this special day. I'm so excited to start this new chapter of my life with Alex. We're going to be so happy together."
"In that moment, maybe for the first time ever for me, she looked like a little",girl. She was a little girl. I recognized the mask Sarah wore for what it was.,"girl, not a woman, not a mother, not a wife, but a little girl, lost and scared,",32,"girl, not a woman, not a mother, not a wife, but a little girl, lost and scared, and I felt a pang of guilt and responsibility for putting her in this situation. I wanted to reach out and comfort her, to tell her that everything would be okay, but I didn't know if that was true. I didn't know if I could fix this, if I could make it right. All I knew was that I had to try, for her sake, for mine, for the sake of our relationship, which was hanging by a thread. I took a deep breath and began to speak, hoping that my words would be the right ones, hoping that they would bring us back from the brink of disaster."
"After we finished with the lice, I set up the blanket in the backyard. With the landscaping Mom did, it was pretty nice back there with its hanging lights, citronella candles, and magnolia trees. I ordered a","pizza, connected my phone to a Bluetooth speaker, and poured the wine I brought, and Emma and I hung out and talked. Mom had a giant Jenga and we set that up and played a few rounds.","few pizzas and some finger foods, and we had a little picnic. The kids ran around and played tag, while the adults sat and chatted. It was a really nice evening, and I was glad we could",74,"few pizzas and some finger foods, and we had a little picnic. The kids ran around and played tag, while the adults sat and chatted. It was a really nice evening, and I was glad we could spend some quality time together as a family. As the night went on, we decided to have a little campfire and make some s'mores. The kids loved roasting their marshmallows and making a mess with the chocolate and graham crackers. My sister brought out her guitar and we had a little sing along. It was a really nice way to end the night, and I was grateful for the opportunity to spend some time with my loved ones."
"“I’m a surgeon, Amber. I don’t have a nine-to-five, I stay until","it’s done, I can’t answer the phone in the middle of an appendectomy—”","the job is done, no matter how long it takes. And sometimes that means",25,"the job is done, no matter how long it takes. And sometimes that means I have to miss out on things that are important to me, like your birthday party. But I promise you, kiddo, I'll make it up to you, okay?"
"Amber drew her arm back and threw the large glass thing again, only this","time it bounced off the car’s hood, hit the concrete, and broke in half.","time with all her might, feeling a surge of adrenaline as it soared through",28,"time with all her might, feeling a surge of adrenaline as it soared through the air, spinning end over end, and shattered against the wall with a loud crash, sending shards of glass flying in all directions, some of them embedding themselves in the nearby furniture, while others tinkled to the floor like a thousand tiny wind chimes, the sound echoing through the room like a death knell, signaling the end of something, though Ambers wasn't quite sure what."
"“I have the van,” he said, his hands wandering. “Alex can’t drive it yet, so",it’s just sitting there. Uber the next time you come over and take my car home.”,he'll have to ride with me. I'll drop him off at the library on my way to the warehouse.,31,"he'll have to ride with me. I'll drop him off at the library on my way to the warehouse. He's been studying for his driver's test, but he's still not confident enough to take it yet. I'm not sure what's holding him back, maybe it's just nerves. Anyway, I've got to get going, I've got a long day ahead of me. I've got to pick up some supplies from the warehouse and then head to the job site. We're on a tight deadline and I don't want to fall behind. I'll just grab my lunch and head out the door, I don't have time to waste."
He slipped a hand into my underwear and I sucked in a breath of air. “What time does,"Alex get up for the bus?” I whispered, tipping my head back as he nibbled on my ear.","your shift end?” he whispered, his warm breath dancing across my skin. I tried to push",36,"your shift end?” he whispered, his warm breath dancing across my skin. I tried to push him away, but he held firm, his fingers tracing the edge of my panties. I felt a shiver run down my spine as he leaned in closer, his lips brushing against my ear. “I can make it worth your while to stay a little longer,” he whispered, his voice low and husky. I felt a flutter in my chest, and for a moment, I forgot about the bar, the patrons, and the fact that I was still on the clock. All I could think about was the way his fingers felt against my skin, and the way his voice made me feel like I was the only person in the world."
"I came downstairs still in my pajamas, following the smell of bacon, glad I was actually in the right headspace to eat with everyone. When the stair creaked","as I made my way to the kitchen, Sarah poked her head out the door and saw me coming. “She’s here!” She darted back the way she came.","under my feet, I froze, hoping I hadn't woken anyone up.

But the sound of sizzling meat and lively chatter from the kitchen reassured me that everyone was already awake. As I entered the kitchen, I was greeted by the warm smile of my mom, who was busy flipping pancakes on the griddle. My dad was sitting at the table, sipping his coffee and reading the newspaper, while my little sister was bouncing around the room, excitement radiating from her very being. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, filled with the delicious aromas of a home-cooked meal. I took a deep breath, feeling grateful for this moment of peace and togetherness with my family, and made my way to the table to join them for breakfast."
