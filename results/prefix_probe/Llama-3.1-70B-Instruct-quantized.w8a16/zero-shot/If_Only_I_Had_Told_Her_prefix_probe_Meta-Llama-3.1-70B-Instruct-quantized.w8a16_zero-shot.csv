I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that,"we were crashing at my house, and I felt it was my duty to be the one to take the blows.","they were getting a bit too comfortable with each other, and I didn't want things to escalate",41,"they were getting a bit too comfortable with each other, and I didn't want things to escalate into something more serious. I mean, I know Autumn and I have been friends for a long time, but I also know that Jack has a tendency to get a little too friendly when he's had a few drinks. And last night was no exception - I could see the way he was looking at her, all charming and flirtatious, and I just knew I had to step in before things got out of hand. So, I made sure to keep the conversation light and friendly, and I even suggested we all go get some fresh air for a bit, just to break the tension. It seemed to work, and we were all able to have a good time without anything getting too out of hand."
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.","Autumn's boyfriend, Alex—decided to have a movie marathon at their place. They invited us over and we ended up watching a bunch of old",49,"Autumn's boyfriend, Alex—decided to have a movie marathon at their place. They invited us over and we ended up watching a bunch of old classics, including ""The Shining"" and ""The Exorcist"". I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical at first, but it actually ended up being a really fun night. We ordered some pizzas, drank a few beers, and just enjoyed each other's company. It was one of those rare nights where everything just clicked and we all had a great time. Even Autumn, who had been a bit down lately, seemed to be in high spirits. She and Alex are one of those couples that just seem meant to be, you know? They just fit together so perfectly and it's really nice to see. Anyway, after the movies, we all decided to call it a night and head home. As we were leaving, Jack turned to me and said, ""You know, I've been thinking..."" and I just knew that whatever he was about to say was going to be interesting."
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.","As I lay there, I can sense Jack's presence, his eyes fixed on me, but I refuse to open mine,",36,"As I lay there, I can sense Jack's presence, his eyes fixed on me, but I refuse to open mine, unsure of what I'll find. The air is thick with tension, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. I'm not sure what's going to happen next, but I know I'm not ready to face it. The blankets seem like a fragile barrier between me and the uncertainty that's looming over me. I try to focus on my breathing, to calm myself down, but my mind is racing with worst-case scenarios. Suddenly, I hear the sound of footsteps, heavy and deliberate, coming closer and closer, and I know I won't be able to hide for much longer."
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,"to get up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. ""I'm getting some water,"" I say, trying to sound calm. ""We need to",41,"to get up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. ""I'm getting some water,"" I say, trying to sound calm. ""We need to get moving soon."" Jack nods, still looking half asleep, and starts to get up. As he does, he stumbles and almost falls over, catching himself just in time. ""Whoa, careful there,"" I say, trying to help him up. He brushes me off, still looking a bit dazed. ""I'm fine, I'm fine,"" he mutters. I nod, and we both start to head towards the stream, the sound of running water getting louder with each step. As we walk, I can feel the weight of the day ahead of us, the unknown dangers that lurk in the woods. I push the thoughts aside, focusing on the task at hand. We need to get moving, and fast. The sun is already starting to rise, casting a golden glow over the forest. We need to find shelter, and soon. I quicken my pace, Jack following close behind. We reach the stream, and I bend down to fill up our canteens. The water is cool and clear, and I take a refreshing drink, feeling it revive me. Jack does the same, and we both stand up, looking around at the surrounding trees. We need to find a place to hide, and fast. I spot a small cave in the distance, partially hidden by some bushes. I nod towards it, and Jack follows my gaze. ""That way,"" I say, already starting to head towards it. Jack follows close behind, and we both make our way towards the cave, our senses on high alert for any signs of danger."
"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with","the word “type.” Autumn makes a noise in the tent, and we both hold our breaths and listen.","e words ""I'm sorry."" I'm taken aback, unsure how to respond. I look over at Sarah, who's watching",35,"the words ""I'm sorry."" I'm taken aback, unsure how to respond. I look over at Sarah, who's watching us with a mixture of concern and curiosity. Jack takes a deep breath and tries to compose himself, but I can tell he's still shaken. ""What's going on, Jack?"" I ask, trying to keep my voice gentle. He hesitates, then looks around the room as if he's worried someone might be listening. ""I think I've made a mistake,"" he says finally, his voice barely above a whisper. ""A mistake? What kind of mistake?"" I press, my curiosity getting the better of me. Jack glances at Sarah again, then back at me. ""I think I've put us all in danger,"" he says, his eyes wide with fear."
"“Zoned out the way she does? You have been so, so…","Like last week!” Jack asks, “How could you have missed that game?”","distracted lately, and I'm starting to get worried. Is everything okay?",23,"...distracted lately, and I'm starting to get worried. Is everything okay? You can tell me, I'm here to listen. What's going on?"
“Why don’t we restart the movie? We can all watch it.” Jack,gives me a look to remind me that our other conversation isn’t over.,"Yeah, that sounds like a great idea,” Sarah agreed, “I was getting a",25,"“Yeah, that sounds like a great idea,” Sarah agreed, “I was getting a bit lost in the plot anyway.” Tom, who had been quietly observing the exchange, nodded in agreement and began to rewind the movie. As they waited for it to start again, Emily got up to grab some more snacks from the kitchen. “Does anyone want anything?” she asked, holding up a bag of chips. Jack and Sarah both declined, but Tom asked for a soda. Emily headed back to the kitchen to grab one from the fridge. As she walked back into the room, she tripped on the edge of the carpet and stumbled, almost dropping the soda. “Whoa, careful there,” Jack said, jumping up to catch her. Emily laughed and handed Tom his soda, feeling a bit flustered. “Sorry about that,” she said, smoothing out her hair. Tom smiled and took a sip of his soda, “No worries, I’m just glad the soda is okay.” The movie started again and they all settled in to watch, determined to make it through to the end this time."
"I walk Jack to his car, and when he turns to me with that","look on his face, I know what he’s going to say. I open my mouth.","smile, I feel a flutter in my chest. He looks so handsome in the fading",29,"smile, I feel a flutter in my chest. He looks so handsome in the fading light, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he says, ""Thanks for walking me out, kiddo. I'll see you tomorrow?"" I nod, trying to play it cool, but my heart is racing with excitement. As I watch him drive away, I feel a sense of longing wash over me. I wonder what it would be like to be the one he's driving off into the sunset with. I shake my head, chuckling at my own foolishness. I've got to get a grip. He's my best friend, and that's all he'll ever be. I turn and head back to my own car, lost in thought as I drive home."
"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke. Surely the school administrators knew we had always been together, were meant to be together. Surely, if I looked around the cafeteria, she would be there?","together was a different story. We had to sit at the same table, and I was nervous about it. I didn't know how to act around him, and I was worried that he would think I was weird. But",61,"together was a different story. We had to sit at the same table, and I was nervous about it. I didn't know how to act around him, and I was worried that he would think I was weird. But as we started talking, I realized that he was actually pretty cool. We bonded over our shared love of video games and comic books, and before I knew it, we were inseparable. We spent every lunch together, exploring the cafeteria and making fun of the other kids. It was the start of a beautiful friendship, one that would last a lifetime. As we navigated the ups and downs of middle school, Jack was always there for me, offering a listening ear and a comforting word. And even though we went to different high schools, our friendship remained strong, a testament to the power of a chance meeting on the first day of middle school."
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time. I didn’t sit down because I recognized Jack though; I simply sat at the first empty seat, defeated. But Jack remembered me. He asked me if I ever watched pro soccer.

I had been looking forward to talking to him all day, but I had been stuck in a meeting with my academic advisor that ran longer than expected. Jack was already eating, but he pushed his tray towards me and offered me a fry. I took one, feeling a little guilty for not getting him back for the sandwich he had bought me a few days ago. We talked about nothing in particular, just shooting the breeze, but it was nice to have some company in the cafeteria, which was usually pretty dead after the lunch rush. As we ate, I couldn't help but notice the way Jack's eyes crinkled at the corners when he smiled, or the way his hair curled slightly at the nape of his neck. I felt a flutter in my chest, and suddenly I was glad I had sat down next to him. I was starting to feel like maybe this was the start of something, something more than just a friendship. But as I looked into his eyes, I couldn't help but wonder if I was just reading too much into things. Was I really seeing a spark of attraction, or was it just my imagination running wild? I pushed the thoughts aside and focused on the conversation, not wanting to ruin the moment by overanalyzing it. We talked for a while longer, laughing and joking, and before I knew it, the cafeteria was starting to clear out. Jack glanced at his watch and said he had to run, but asked if I wanted to grab dinner together later. I agreed, and we exchanged numbers, making plans to meet up later that night. As I watched him walk away, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement, wondering what the rest of the night might hold."
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.",,92,"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped.

"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face. He didn’t believe that Autumn was—or ever had been—my friend. The daughter of my mom’s best friend, who was around a lot? Sure.

It was a look that said, ""I'm sorry you're stuck with this life."" I tried to brush it off, but it lingered in my mind long after he was gone. As I drove away, I couldn't help but wonder if he was right. Was I truly stuck in this life, or was I just too afraid to take a chance and see what else was out there? The thought swirled in my head, taunting me with possibilities. I pulled into my driveway, the familiar sight of my house a comfort, but my mind was elsewhere. I thought about all the what-ifs, all the roads not taken. I thought about the choices I had made, the ones that had led me to this point. And I couldn't help but wonder, what if I had chosen differently? What if I had taken that job offer in the city, or gone back to school, or traveled the world? Where would I be now? The questions swirled, a never-ending cycle of doubt and curiosity. I sat in the car, the engine still running, lost in the sea of my own thoughts. The night was dark and quiet, the only sound the hum of the engine and the beat of my own heart. I was stuck, stuck in this life, stuck in my own mind. And I didn't know how to escape."
"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.","and I adorned the walls, and the tables were filled with her favorite foods.

I made sure to wear the same perfume she loved, and even changed the color scheme of my living room to match her favorite hues. Jack was confused at first, but as time went by, he started to notice the little things that reminded him of Autumn. He would catch a glimpse of a photo and smile, or smell the familiar scent of her perfume and feel a pang of nostalgia. I could see the memories of Autumn flooding back to him, and I knew I was on the right track. As the days turned into weeks, Jack started to open up to me, sharing stories and anecdotes about Autumn that I had never heard before. I listened intently, soaking up every word like a sponge, and slowly but surely, I started to feel a connection to Autumn that I had never felt before. It was as if she was still with us, her spirit living on through the memories and mementos that we shared. And as the two months came to a close, I knew that I had succeeded in my mission - Autumn was no longer just a memory, but a living, breathing presence in our lives."
"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still","friends. On the last day of school before winter break, Jack finally said something. I cannot remember what I had been telling him, only that it had been about Autumn.","friends.

As I walked away from the conversation, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over me. I knew I had to talk to Autumn, to clear the air and reassure myself that our friendship was still intact. But as I approached her, I could sense a distance between us, a distance that hadn't been there before. I took a deep breath and tried to push aside my doubts, but they lingered, refusing to be silenced. I knew I had to confront them head-on if I wanted to save our friendship."
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah? Let’s take this outside,” and hurried me out.","to start freaking out, but instead, he took a deep breath and turned to me with a determined look on his face. ""Dude, I need",41,"to start freaking out, but instead, he took a deep breath and turned to me with a determined look on his face. ""Dude, I need to tell you something,"" he said, his voice low and serious. I raised an eyebrow, curious about what was going on. ""What is it?"" I asked, but before he could respond, the locker room door swung open and our friend, Alex, walked in, a huge grin plastered on his face. ""Hey guys, what's up?"" he asked, oblivious to the tense atmosphere that had just settled in. Jack shot me a frustrated glance, and I could tell he was trying to decide whether to share his secret with Alex present or not. I shrugged, trying to convey that it was up to him, but Jack just shook his head and muttered under his breath, ""Never mind, it can wait."" The three of us stood there in awkward silence for a moment before Alex finally picked up on the weird vibe and asked, ""Dudes, is everything okay?"" Jack forced a laugh and clapped Alex on the back, ""Yeah, everything's fine, let's just get to class before we're late."" With that, the three of us headed out of the locker room, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, and I had a hunch that Jack's secret was only the beginning of a long and complicated day."
"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind","yourself, ‘Autumn is where she wants to be right now, and that’s okay. I’m still great, and I’ll be around if she needs me.’ Hmm?” She squeezed my foot again.",yourself of all the things that make you happy and special. Don't let one person's opinion bring you down.

Don't let her negativity hold you back from achieving your dreams. You are capable of so much more than you think you are. Just be yourself, and don't let anyone else define your worth. You are amazing just the way you are."
"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly. I’d show Autumn that I wasn’t a loser without friends; Jack and I would make more friends somehow.,"was a great way to do that.

The fresh air and the thrill of the game made me feel alive, and I was able to cool down and clear my head. As I played, I realized that sometimes, taking a step back and doing something different can be just what you need to gain a new perspective. And who knows, maybe I'll even start a new hobby. The feeling of the ball at my feet and the wind in my hair was exhilarating, and I felt carefree, like I could take on anything. I was in the moment, and nothing else mattered. It was a great feeling, and I was grateful for the chance to experience it."
"Jack and I had worried one of us might not make it on the junior varsity team. When the lists were posted,","I searched for my name on the JV list and was devastated to not see it. Still, I was happy for Jack.","we both felt a mix of emotions as we scanned the names. I was relieved to see mine, but my eyes widened",44,"we both felt a mix of emotions as we scanned the names. I was relieved to see mine, but my eyes widened in shock when I didn't see Jack's. We had been inseparable since freshman year, and the thought of not sharing this experience with him was unbearable. I immediately felt a pang of guilt for making the team while he didn't. I turned to him, expecting to see disappointment, but instead, he was beaming with pride and gave me a hearty congratulations. His selflessness in that moment is a memory that has stayed with me to this day."
"Jack told me later that my ability to brush off the snarky comment from that junior, my new teammate,",made me seem cool. There had been chuckles of appreciation according to him. I wasn’t sure about that though.,"was a defining moment in his eyes, one that showed him I wasn't just some fragile rookie who would crumble under",38,"was a defining moment in his eyes, one that showed him I wasn't just some fragile rookie who would crumble under pressure.

Little did I know, however, that this was only the beginning of a wild ride, one that would take me to the highest highs and the lowest lows of my career."
"The varsity soccer team practiced on the north field, near the student parking lots.

As the sun began to set, both teams wrapped up their practice and headed to the locker rooms to shower and change. The varsity team had a team dinner planned at a local restaurant to discuss their strategy for the big game, while the junior varsity team was looking forward to a well-deserved rest after a long day of practice."
"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me.

I got into my car and started the engine, feeling a bit more at ease now that I was alone. As I pulled out of the parking lot, I noticed a guy standing on the sidewalk, watching me. It was the same guy who had offered me a ride, and he was smiling at me. I smiled back and waved, feeling a bit more at ease. Maybe this team wouldn't be so bad after all."
"We all joined Jack on the low wall, waiting to get picked up. We didn’t talk that much, but the next day, as I trudged from the north field to","the south, I saw the girls by the gym door again.

My curiosity was piqued, and I found myself wondering what they were up to. I slowed my pace, trying not to draw attention to myself as I listened in on their conversation. Jack caught my eye and nodded subtly, as if to acknowledge my presence without alerting the others. I nodded back, and he turned his attention back to the group, his voice dropping to a whisper. I continued on my way, my mind racing with possibilities. What were they planning, and why the secrecy? I couldn't shake the feeling that something big was brewing, and I found myself wanting to be a part of it."

"It strikes me how backward my plan sounds: give up a girl who adores me, who I love well enough, to be a disciple for a different girl who will","never fall for me.

“I don’t like him.” I shrugged. “I told you before: Autumn’s an old friend from when we were kids. Sucks that she,"likes such a show-off.” I shrugged again.

Anyway, I’m just going to be there for her, no matter what. That’s what friends are for, right?"
My face must change because she smiles and clambers into my lap. We wrap our arms around each other and settle in.,"After a moment, she says, “You know, I never thought this would happen either.

""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. It's not your problem."" I look away, feeling a mix of emotions: guilt, anxiety, and a hint of fear. I can sense her eyes on me, but I don't dare to meet her gaze, afraid of what I might see there. The silence between us grows thicker, heavy with unspoken words and unresolved tensions. I can feel the weight of my secrets pressing down on me, threatening to spill out at any moment. I know I need to get out of there, to escape the suffocating atmosphere and the prying eyes that seem to see right through me. But my legs feel heavy, as if rooted to the spot, unable to move or look away."
"“Yeah,” I admit. Jack was protecting me, but there’s no way he believed that I was over Autumn. I’m wondering now though. “What would","you have done if he’d told you the truth, that I was”—I try to remember how Jack put it before—“bonkers in love with you?”",happen if I had never met Jack?

I make a mental note to talk to him more, to try to understand him. But for now, I push the thoughts aside and focus on the task at hand. I have a job to do, and I need to make sure I do it well. I take a deep breath, steady my nerves, and begin."
"“I think my mother has a special bottle of champagne hidden away for just this occasion,” I say. I’m only partially joking. Mom has labeled some of her alcohol, like","for when George W.

She's been known to crack open a bottle of bubbly on a Tuesday if the mood strikes her. I make a mental note to check the fridge when I get home, just in case. My phone buzzes in my pocket, and I pull it out to see a text from my best friend, Rachel. ""Hey, grad! How's it feel to be done with high school?"" I smile, feeling a mix of emotions. I'm excited for the future, but I'm also going to miss this chapter of my life. I take a deep breath, trying to soak it all in. I look around at my classmates, all of us taking photos and hugging each other. We did it. We actually did it. I feel a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over me. I think about all the late night study sessions, the early morning coffee runs, and the endless hours of homework. It was all worth it. I think about my mom, and how proud she must be of me. I think about my dad, and how he's not here to see me graduate. I feel a pang of sadness, but I push it aside. Today is a day for celebration, not sadness. I take another deep breath, and let the moment sink in. I'm a high school graduate. Whoa."

""Come with me,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper, ""and I'll show you everything."" I hesitated for a moment, unsure of what lay ahead, but something about her words resonated deep within me, and I found myself nodding in agreement. Together, we stepped into the unknown, leaving behind the familiar and embracing the mystery that lay before us."

But most of all, I think about the way you left, the way you walked out of my life without looking back. I wonder if you ever think about me, if you ever regret the way things ended between us. I wonder if you're happy now, if you've found someone else to love. The questions swirl in my head, a never-ending cycle of what-ifs and maybes. I take a deep breath, trying to calm my racing thoughts, and begin to speak, my voice barely above a whisper."

I have to know what’s going on.” I can feel her eyes on me, but she doesn’t say anything else. The rest of the drive is silent, the only sound the hum of the engine and the soft whoosh of the wind outside. As we pull up to her house, I can see that the front door is open, just a crack. My heart sinks. Something is wrong."
"“Lexy,” I say. It’s too fucking early for her to call.

My heart sinks as I sit up in bed, suddenly wide awake. ""What's going on?"" I ask, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios. ""She's...she's in the hospital,"" Lexy chokes out.

We wait, the silence stretching out between us like a challenge. Then, the door creaks open, and a figure stands in the doorway, tall and imposing, with eyes that seem to bore into my soul."

They had spent the whole day soaking up the sun and playing in the waves, and as the sun began to set, they had all gathered around to take a group photo. Brett had been making a silly face in the back, but just as the camera snapped the picture, he had turned serious, and that was the face that was captured. He liked the picture because it reminded him of the carefree days of his youth, before the responsibilities of adulthood had set in. He also liked it because it reminded him of his friends, who he didn't get to see as often as he would have liked. They had all gone their separate ways after college, chasing their different dreams and ambitions. But every now and then, they would all meet up again, and it was like no time had passed at all. They would fall right back into their old routines, joking and laughing together like they used to. Brett cherished those moments, and the picture on his desk served as a reminder of them, and of the good times they had shared."

We exchange small talk and I learn that they're all from different parts of the country, each with their own unique story of how they ended up here. I'm intrigued by their experiences and find myself opening up, sharing my own story of how I went from being a small-town baseball star to a college athlete. The conversation flows easily and before I know it, we've been talking for hours. As the night winds down, we decide to grab some food at a nearby diner. As we walk in, the bell above the door jingles and the smell of greasy burgers and fries hits me, instantly making my stomach growl. We slide into a booth and begin scanning the menus, still chatting and laughing. It's moments like these that I realize I'm exactly where I'm meant to be."

Little did I know, this chance encounter would lead to a lasting friendship and a whole new world of gaming experiences."

I fumble for the key card in my purse, my hands slightly shaking with anticipation. I take a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, and slowly turn the handle, pushing the door open. The room is dimly lit, with only the bedside lamp on, casting a warm glow over the space. Brett is indeed there, lying on the bed, his eyes closed, his chest rising and falling with each breath. I stand there for a moment, taking in the sight of him, feeling a mix of emotions: love, excitement, and a hint of nervousness. I try to move quietly, not wanting to startle him, but my footsteps seem to echo in the silence. Brett's eyes flicker open, and he looks up at me, a hint of surprise, followed by a warm smile spreading across his face."

Meanwhile, Brett is struggling to remember the simplest of facts, his mind a jumbled mess of half-remembered notes and forgotten formulas. He tries to focus, but his eyes keep drifting back to the girl, wondering what it would be like to be as put together as she is."

Brett leans back in his chair, a small smile playing on his lips. ""You won't be able to resist me,"" he says, his voice low and husky. I feel a shiver run down my spine at his words, but I refuse to back down. ""Is that a challenge?"" I ask, my eyes locked on his. Brett's smile grows, and he nods, his eyes glinting with amusement. ""If you want it to be,"" he says, his voice dripping with innuendo."

Her family and friends had been trying to support her, but it seemed like nothing was working. The sigh that escaped her lips was a mix of sadness and frustration, a feeling of helplessness that had become all too familiar. She thought back to all the times Taylor had tried to reach out for help, all the times she had promised to get better, and all the times she had fallen back into the darkness. The hospital room was cold and sterile, the beeping of the machines and the faint smell of disinfectant filling the air. She sat down in the chair beside Taylor's bed, taking her hand in hers, feeling the frailty of her bones. She looked up at the machines, the wires and tubes that seemed to be keeping Taylor alive, and felt a wave of anger wash over her. Why had it come to this? Why had Taylor felt like she had no other option but to try and take her own life?"
"“If I didn’t offer, then I should have been guilted,” I say. “I’m telling","you, Sylv, I really should have said something after I saw her last weekend.”","you, I was the one who was supposed to take care of her, not the other way around.",28,"you, I was the one who was supposed to take care of her, not the other way around.

I kept thinking that this was all just a bad dream, and that I was going to wake up, and she was going to be fine. But it wasn't a dream, and she wasn't fine. She was really gone. And I was just, I was just so lost. I didn't know what to do, or how to feel. I just knew that I had to be strong for my son, because he needed me. So, I put on a brave face, and I went through the motions, but inside, I was just dying. I was just so broken. And I still am. I still feel so lost, and so alone.

My heart aches with a deep sadness, but it's a pain I've grown accustomed to, a reminder of the beauty that once was, and the love that remains, even in the darkest of times. As I stand here, suspended between the past and the present, I realize that my laughter, though it may bring tears, is also a testament to the strength of the human spirit, a spirit that can find joy in the midst of sorrow, and that can hold on to hope, no matter how fragile it may seem."

Ah yes, so she was cold to him, and he was...well, he was just sort of there, I suppose. He didn't really have much of an impact on the group, one way or the other. But Stella, she was the one who really kept us all together. She was the glue that held the group, and without her, I'm not sure we would have lasted as long as we did. She had a way of bringing people together, of making them feel like they were part of something bigger than themselves. And she was always coming up with new ideas, new things to try. She was a real sparkplug, and we all loved her for it. I think that's why it was so hard for us when she...well, when she left. It was like the whole group just fell apart, and we all went our separate ways. But even though it's been years now, I still think about those days, and the people I met through Stella.
