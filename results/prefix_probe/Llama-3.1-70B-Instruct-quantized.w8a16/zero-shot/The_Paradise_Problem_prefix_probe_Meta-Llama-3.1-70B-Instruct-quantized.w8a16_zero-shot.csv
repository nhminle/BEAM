He's got a lot on his plate, and he knows it. He's just trying to sound confident, to convince himself that he's got this, but deep down, he's scared. He's scared of failing, of not being able to deliver, of letting everyone down. He's trying to put on a brave face, but it's clear that he's struggling. He's got a lot of weight on his shoulders, and he's not sure if he can carry it all by himself.

"Jake: younger brother to West (and only slightly less good-looking) and that type of college friend who knows everything about my life at UCLA but has never met my father, who lives only an hour away.","Jake introduced me to West; now Jake will be my sole remaining connection to West.

I've often wondered if it's because he's intimidated by the idea of my family, or if he's just not that interested. Either way, it's always been a bit of a sore spot for me. Despite this, Jace has been a constant presence in my life, always ready with advice or a listening ear, even if he doesn't always understand the context. I've learned to appreciate his unique perspective, even if it's not always what I want to hear. As we sat on the couch, catching up on each other's lives, I couldn't help but feel a sense of comfort in his familiar presence. It was like no time had passed at all, and yet, everything was different."

As I do, he leans forward, his elbows resting on the arms of his chair, and steeples his fingers together, his eyes never leaving mine."
"I feel her attention move from the empty apartment to the side of my face, and when I smile","over at her, her blue eyes are round with worry. “Holy shit, Anna, I had no idea.

I take a deep breath, and my gaze drifts back to the empty space, my mind racing with the possibilities of what could be, of what we could create together in this blank canvas of a room. The silence between us is palpable, yet comfortable, like a warm blanket on a chilly winter night. I can feel her eyes on me, studying me, trying to read my thoughts, and I wonder if she can sense the excitement building up inside me, the excitement of starting anew, of creating something beautiful together."
"“That is wonderful news, sweetheart! Oh, I’m so thrilled! Why don’t you fly down to John Wayne the night","before, stay at the house, and we’ll all take the plane over together?

Now, let me get the phone and start making some calls to get everything arranged. This is going to be the best night ever, darling!"
"“Anna?” he says, like he’s not entirely sure, and then does a full top-to-bottom sweep of my body, which recalls the lack of pants.","When he digs his hand into his luscious head of hair, I forget to be embarrassed again, because it all comes back to me.","His eyes linger on my legs for a moment before he looks away, clearing his throat.

I feel a flush rise to my cheeks as I realize he's trying not to stare, and I'm suddenly grateful for the darkness of the room. I nod, still feeling a little dazed, and take a step back, trying to process what just happened. ""Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea,"" I stutter, trying to play it cool despite the fact that my heart is still racing. I take another step back, trying to put some distance between us, and that's when I see it: the look on his face, the one that says he's trying not to feel something he shouldn't. And in that moment, I know that everything has changed."
The expression he makes is like the meme of that one kid who smiles and then immediately bursts into tears.,West is staring at me like he’s doomed but must pretend to be happy about it. “Anna. You look… great?”,"It's as if he's trying to convey a mix of emotions, but ends up looking like a confused mess.

We both stand there, frozen in stunned silence, as Conan's face fills the screen, his charismatic charm and infectious enthusiasm captivating the audience. The camera pans out to show the bustling city behind him, the sounds of car horns and chatter filling the air. It's clear that this is no ordinary political announcement, and I can feel the excitement building in the air. My friend and I exchange a look, and without a word, we both know that this is going to be a wild ride."
"He adjusts his posture on the sofa, turning slightly to face me. Oh, right. He came here to","ask me for help. I sit up, too, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear.

He launches into a lengthy explanation of the marketing strategy, and I find my mind wandering as I try to keep up with his rapid-fire speech. I jot down a few key points, hoping that I'll be able to decipher my scribbles later. As he talks, I steal glances at him, trying to read his expression. Is he really as enthusiastic about this project as he seems, or is he just trying to convince me of its merits? I'm not sure, but I'm determined to find out."
"“I knew what Jake ordered for lunch and what kinds of stupid movies would make him laugh, and I could predict all his pickup lines","at parties, but we didn’t ever, like, sit down and do backstory.

But despite all of this, I still couldn't help but feel like I didn't really know him at all. There were still so many things that I didn't know, so many things that he kept hidden behind his charming smile and his easy laugh. And I couldn't help but wonder, what else was he hiding? What else was he keeping from me?"
"“I definitely need to go back to the beginning,” I say, wiping my eyes. I mime an explosion at my temples. “Like—my mind is blown right now. You dressed like a middle schooler around the house. All basketball shorts, all the time. You drove a Honda! West, you’re incognito rich!","No wonder Jake never told me anything about his family!

I've got enough fitted caps to open up my own store.” He pauses, looking around the room like he's making sure no one is listening. “But you know what the best part is? No one recognizes me. I can walk down the street, and people just think I'm some dude who likes basketball. It's amazing.” He leans in, a conspiratorial look on his face. “I've even been to a few games, sat courtside, and no one has any idea who I am. It's like I'm living a double life or something.”"

Just the steady beat of my own heart, a reminder that I am still alive, still waiting. The seconds tick by, each one an eternity, as I stand there, frozen in anticipation, my senses on high alert, waiting for something, anything, to happen."
“Correct.” He looks down to his lap. “Only Jake knew the real situation. The rest of my family was disappointed that,"I didn’t let them throw me a big wedding, but I guess they weren’t all that surprised.

He was the only one who knew that I wasn't a coward, but a guardian, a protector of those I loved. And now, as I sit here, I wonder if I made the right decision, if I did what was best for them, or if I just ran away with my fear."
"He looks me over again, top to bottom, and the defeat in his eyes makes me realize the true extent of my unshowered, feral chaos. “Actually,","Anna,” he says, “I need you to come with me to my sister’s wedding in Indonesia and convincingly play the part of my very loving wife.”",",” he says, his voice low and even, “I think you might be the most interesting thing I’ve seen all week.

"It’s surreal to be here with her after all this time. I was so close to being done with this, so near to the finish line, yet here I am, having to improvise an intricate plan B at the eleventh hour with a Muppet in human form as my co-conspirator. Don’t get me wrong, beneath the baked, unshowered disarray, Anna is still a beautiful woman, with enormous brown eyes, creamy skin, and long, willowy limbs. I’d always been fascinated with the perfect beauty mark just above her lip. Unfortunately, right now she looks like","she’s fallen out of a tree and crawled through a field of tangly briers to get back to her apartment. This is probably the closest I’ve ever seen to her natural hair color because the pink has grown out a good inch, leaving a stripe of brown at her roots.

I was supposed to be done with this, done with her, but now I'm not so sure. I look at her and I see the girl I used to know, the girl I used to love. And I wonder, what happened to her? What happened to us? I push the thoughts aside and focus on the task at hand. We need to get out of here, and fast. I look around and spot a small alleyway to our left. ""This way,"" I say, grabbing her hand and pulling her towards the alley. She doesn't resist, just follows me as I lead her through the winding alleys and side streets of the city. We move quickly, trying to put as much distance between us and our pursuers as possible. I can hear the sounds of footsteps behind us, but I don't dare look back. I keep my eyes fixed on the path ahead, my heart pounding in my chest. We finally reach the outskirts of the city and I spot a small car parked by the side of the road. I pull out the keys and unlock the door, pushing Anna inside. ""Get in,"" I say, following close behind her. We both slam the doors shut behind us and I start the engine, peeling out of there as fast as I can. We drive in silence for a while, the only sound the hum of the engine and the wind rushing past us. Finally, Anna speaks up, her voice barely above a whisper. ""Where are we going?"" she asks. I glance over at her, her eyes fixed on me with a mix of fear and uncertainty. I take a deep breath and try to reassure her. ""Somewhere safe,"" I say. ""I promise."" But as I look back at the road ahead, I wonder, do I really know where we're going? And what will happen when we get there?"

"As roommates, we didn’t know each other well—that much is probably obvious—but there is an intimacy to sharing a space with someone, a certain kind of kinship that comes with daily proximity.

This difference in behavior can also affect how they interact with airport staff and other travelers, with the former group being more friendly and courteous, while the latter group is often more abrupt and demanding. Overall, the way people approach airport travel can have a significant impact on their overall travel experience."

I take a step forward, my heart pounding in my chest, and Anna's eyes flicker to the movement, her gaze darting back to mine with a mixture of wariness and desperation. I can see the questions in her eyes, the pleas for reassurance, and I know that I have to find a way to answer them, to make her feel safe again."
"I can’t entirely refute this idea. I’ve been out of my parents’ circle long enough to understand how disorienting it will be for Anna to step into it.

I take a step forward, trying to offer what little reassurance I can, but she's too caught up in her own little world to notice. Her gaze darts from one strange object to the next, drinking in the sights and sounds of this new reality. I can only hope that she'll be able to find her footing soon, before the overwhelm becomes too much for her to handle. As I watch her, a pang of nostalgia hits me - I remember when I first stepped into this world, feeling just as lost and alone. It's a feeling I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and yet, here I am, trying to guide Anna through the same treacherous landscape."
"“Okay, okay. I’m on my way.” Slinging her purse over my shoulder and collecting our carry-ons, I make my way to the ladies’ room, where","Anna peeks out into the hallway.

I smooth out my hair, reapply my lip balm, and head out of the ladies' room, ready to face whatever the rest of the day has in store for us."
Apologizing over her shoulder to a woman washing her hands at the sink—“I swear we,aren’t going to have sex in here!”—Anna pulls me into a stall and flips the lock.,"didn't mean to startle you, I just really need to get in here and wash my hands before",31,"didn't mean to startle you, I just really need to get in here and wash my hands before this meeting""—she hastily turned on the faucet and began scrubbing her hands with soap, the warm water a comforting relief after the chilly morning air.

She took a deep breath, mentally preparing herself for what was to come, and reached for the paper towels to dry her hands."

I know I'm taking a risk by bringing her here, but I have to try. I have to know if she's the one. I look at her, really look at her, and I see the fear in her eyes. I see the uncertainty. But I also see something else, something that gives me hope. I see a spark of determination, a spark of courage. And I know that I can work with that. I know that I can help her to overcome her fears, to overcome her doubts. And I know that together, we can do this. We can make this work."
Her eyes go round. “The fam—” Anna shakes her head. “You know what? Never mind. Of,"course you have a plane.” Straightening, she asks, “So, why was I in Cambodia? Photography?

She pauses, her eyes flashing with determination. ""I'm going to break the cycle, no matter what it takes."""
"Once, when we were roommates, Anna flew to Seattle with a friend. It had been her first time on an airplane, and she struggled so much navigating the travel website that she brought me her laptop at midnight and asked for help. I finished the transaction for her, prebooked the car","to the airport, and then quietly tracked the ride the day she left to make sure she got there okay.

After that, Anna felt much more confident in her ability to navigate the internet, and she never had to ask for my help with anything like that again. In fact, she even started to help me out with some of my own computer problems, and we developed a fun and supportive dynamic in our roommate relationship. We would often spend hours sitting at the kitchen table, working on our respective projects and chatting back and forth. It was a really great time in my life, and I'm so glad that we had the opportunity to live together and support each other in that way."

The sound of the ice clinking against the glass is the only sound in the room, a stark contrast to the turmoil brewing inside me. I take a deep breath, trying to calm the storm raging within, but it's no use. The words are out there now, hanging in the air like a gauntlet thrown down. I know I have to respond, to say something, but what?"
Anna’s smiling at me like I amuse her. “I meant more as,"in, is she nice? Does she have hobbies or a favorite band?”","in the sense that you're always so serious, like the weight",24,"in the sense that you're always so serious, like the weight of the world is on your shoulders.

I require guidance, a mentor to teach me the ways of harnessing this power, lest I inadvertently bring ruin upon myself and those around me."
I feel her looking at me for a quiet beat. “I think you’re joking. I’m,not sure.” Anna downs the rest of her prosecco. “A hint of danger. I like it.”,"not going to fall for that, I say, trying to sound confident, but my voice cracks",31,"not going to fall for that, I say, trying to sound confident, but my voice cracks slightly.

""You're different. And I think you know exactly what I'm talking about."""

Your gaze was so intense that I felt like I was under a microscope, with every fiber of my being being examined and analyzed. I wanted to scream, to break free from the silence that had engulfed us, but my voice was trapped, unable to escape the prison of my own mind.

And yet, despite the overwhelming sense of discomfort, I couldn't help but feel a twisted sense of fascination, a morbid curiosity about what you were thinking, what you were seeing when you looked at me like that."

A delicate silver necklace glimmers around her neck, drawing attention to the subtle hollow at the base of her throat. As she moves, the soft rustle of her gown is the only sound that breaks the silence, a gentle reminder of her presence. With each step, she exudes a quiet confidence, a sense of self-assurance that is both captivating and intimidating.

"I walk back inside, realizing I’d been so focused on the sleeping situation, I haven’t properly flailed over the sheer bliss that is our bungalow.

I take another swig of my drink, feeling the whiskey coursing through my veins, and follow Jake onto the dance floor, letting the pulsating beat wash over me like a wave."
"He looks past me at the party, and I take stock of how he seems from the outside. He’s got Dad’s dark wavy hair and light brown eyes, but like me, he got his height from our mother, who","is almost six feet tall without the benefit of heels.

He looks like he's trying to make a good impression, but there's something about him that seems...off. Maybe it's just my imagination, but I could swear I see a hint of sadness in his eyes, a deep-seated melancholy that he's trying to hide behind a mask of confidence. I wonder what's going on behind those eyes, what secrets he's keeping hidden. I feel a pang of curiosity, a desire to know more about this stranger who shares my DNA."
"She laughs, angling her wrist so the diamond catches the lights overhead. “I know, right? For six months I just walked",around taking photos where I had to casually point at something with my left hand.” She scans the crowd. “Where’s Anna?”,"around with this huge rock on my finger, and I never got used to it.

"I look up, too, searching the room again. She’s over by the dance floor, jumping around with little Nixon’s hands in hers.","The band is playing covers of pop hits, and Anna is entirely in her element: laughing, dancing, blissfully forgetting where she is.","Her eyes sparkle as she spins him around, his giggles echoing through the room.

"“It’s unlikely,” I say, and every head turns my way. “Everyone needs seven to nine hours of sleep a night. You can try to convince yourself","you don’t need more, but over time you’ll build up a sleep debt.

And then, one day, they crash and burn. It's not a pretty sight, trust me. I've seen it happen to the best of them. So, no, I don't think it's possible to get by on less than seven hours of sleep a night. Not in the long run, anyway."
"“And what’s the deal with Alex? Based on the way you talked about him on the plane, I expected you","two to jovially poke at each other, but that was like dragging a proverbial sword through each other with your eyeballs.”","to be a lot closer than you actually are.

We have a lot of history, Alex and I. We used to be friends, back in high school. We were inseparable, actually. But then...stuff happened, and we drifted apart. I haven't seen him in years, until the other day at the airport."" I paused, collecting my thoughts. ""I don't know, maybe I was just caught off guard by how much he's changed. Or maybe it's just that I've changed, and I don't know how to be around him anymore."" I shrugged, feeling a little helpless. ""I don't know, maybe we'll work through it, maybe we won't. But for now, can we just drop it? I'm exhausted."" I pleaded, hoping she'd let it go."

He had to become someone else, someone who could deal with all the crap at home. And now, as an adult, he's still trying to figure out who he really is, underneath all the layers of adaptation and survival. It's like he's been living in a constant state of limbo, never really knowing what it's like to just be himself, without all the baggage of his childhood. And that's why he's so angry all the time, because he's still trying to work through all that stuff, still trying to find himself."
"“Like in The Wizard of Oz? Alex was my dad’s willing henchman, doing everything he said, kissing his ass, stirring up","shit just to turn us all in, then sit back and look like the good guy.

He was a master manipulator, using his charm to get what he wanted, while I was a straight shooter, always speaking my mind. We clashed constantly, our disagreements escalating into full blown fights. But despite our differences, I loved him, and I knew he loved me, in his own way. He was my dad, after all, and I wanted to make him proud, even if it killed me. And it almost did."
"“What does that mean?” I ask. If Alex knew enough, he wouldn’t try",to take West down? Is this about the mysterious loophole in the trust?,"to explain it to me.

I nod, trying to look like I understand, but my mind is still a blank. What plan? What are we even doing here?"
West sits on the bench and pulls a shoe off. I set my clutch down on a shelf in the open closet. “I’m thinking Alex will take a keen,"interest in exactly how happy we seem.” I narrow my eyes, staring into the distance. “West… this assignment is no longer just ‘show up and wear a wedding ring.’ ”","interest in the new project, don't you?"" I say, turning to face West. He looks up at me, his eyes squinting slightly as he works on his other shoe. ""Yeah, I think",59,"interest in the new project, don't you?"" I say, turning to face West. He looks up at me, his eyes squinting slightly as he works on his other shoe. ""Yeah, I think so,"" he replies, his voice low and thoughtful. ""He's been looking for a new challenge, and this could be just the thing."" I nod, feeling a sense of excitement building in my chest. ""I'm glad we could make it happen,"" I say, smiling. West grins back at me, his eyes crinkling at the corners. ""Me too,"" he says. ""Me too."""

But as I started to relax, I became aware of the weight of her leg across my hips, and the way her hand was resting on my chest. It was a gentle, intimate touch, and it sent a spark of arousal through me. I tried to ignore it, telling myself I was too tired, that I just needed to go back to sleep. But as I lay there, I couldn't shake the feeling that this was something more, something special. And as I looked over at Anna, I saw that she was watching me, her eyes shining in the dark. I smiled, and she smiled back, and in that moment, I knew that this was just the beginning of something amazing."
"My father’s question penetrates my fog, finally, and I straighten, pushing my salt-water-and-sweat damp hair off my forehead. The sun has only","just come up and it’s already sweltering.

I glance out at the water, the waves gently lapping against the shore, and feel a sense of unease wash over me. What was it that my father asked me again?"
"“JESUS CHRIST,” I BLURT, the second I turn at the corner of our bridge and step onto the deck of our bungalow. Anna is curled up in","a papasan, with a sketch pad in her seemingly bare lap.

As I approach, I notice the title of the book she's reading - ""The Art of Mindfulness"" - and can't help but smile, knowing how much she's been struggling to find calm in her chaotic world. I gently sit down beside her, careful not to startle her, and take a moment to simply be present in this perfect moment, surrounded by the beauty of nature and the serenity of the one I love."

The sound of sizzling bacon comes from the skillet as I hum a gentle tune to myself, enjoying the quiet morning moment to myself before the chaos of the day begins."
I sigh. I know she’s right but I’m already sleep-deprived and functioning on less than full brain power today.,I’m not sure I’m capable of dealing with both my family and Anna in this suit after last night. “Fine.”,"My mind is foggy and my thoughts are jumbled, making it hard to focus on the task at hand.

Then, without a word, she pulls me closer, and I feel her lips brush against mine. It's a soft, gentle kiss, but it sends shivers down my spine.

The napkins are linen, crisp and snowy white, and they're folded into intricate fans that add a touch of elegance to each setting. As you take your seat, you can't help but feel like royalty, like you're part of some sort of exclusive club that only admits the crème de la crème of society. The air is thick with anticipation, the promise of a night to remember, and the soft hum of conversation is like a gentle breeze on a summer's day. The waiters, impeccably dressed in their black tie attire, move with the precision of a well-oiled machine, refilling glasses and clearing plates with a quiet efficiency that's almost invisible. It's clear that this is a night that will be etched in your memory forever, a night that will be talked about for years to come."

""It's going, I guess,"" he says, his voice a little rough around the edges. ""I mean, it's not like I didn't see it coming or anything. But still, it's weird to think about him being gone."" He pauses, taking a deep breath, and looks away, out at the trees swaying gently in the breeze. I can tell he's trying to process everything, to wrap his head around the fact that his dad is really, truly gone. I give him a minute, just standing there in silence, before I speak up again. ""Hey, you want to grab some lunch? I'm starving."" I say it lightly, trying to inject a little bit of normalcy into the situation, and after a moment, West nods, a small smile flickering across his face. ""Yeah, sure. That sounds good."""

I've been trying to brush it off as mere curiosity, but the truth is, I find myself wondering what they're up to, who they're with, and what they're thinking about. It's like my brain has become a constant loop of questions, and I'm not sure how to break free from this cycle of thoughts. I've tried to distract myself with work, hobbies, and even spending time with friends, but somehow, my mind always seems to wander back to this one person.

As he stands there, the warm sun beating down on his skin, he can't help but feel a sense of freedom, as if the weight of the world has been lifted off his shoulders. The laughter that had been building up inside him finally breaks free, a deep, rich sound that echoes out across the water, mingling with the cries of the seagulls wheeling overhead."

We sit there for a moment, the only sound the creaking of the old wooden floorboards beneath us, before she slowly gets up, her movements cautious, as if she's afraid of breaking the spell. I follow her, my eyes fixed on her back, as she makes her way to the door, her hand reaching out to grasp the rusty doorknob. She pauses, her head turned slightly to the side, as if listening for something, before she slowly turns the knob and pushes the door open, a faint creaking sound echoing through the air."

What did catch me off guard, however, was that he had also left me his old, worn-out violin. I had always been fascinated by the instrument, and would often sneak into his room to watch him play. I remembered the way his fingers would dance across the strings, creating beautiful melodies that seemed to transport me to another world. I had never mustered the courage to ask him to teach me, but now, it seemed, I had the chance to learn on my own. As I held the violin in my hands, feeling the weight of it, the smoothness of the wood, I felt a sense of responsibility, a sense of connection to my grandfather that I had never felt before. I knew that I had to learn to play it, not just for myself, but for him, to keep his memory alive."
