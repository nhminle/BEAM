Her one visible eye sparkled with a hint of mischief as she smiled, and I couldn't help but feel drawn to her. ""And you are?"" she asked, her voice husky and confident. I hesitated for a moment, unsure of how much to reveal, but there was something about Adela that put me at ease. ""I'm...just a traveler,"" I said finally, trying to sound nonchalant. Adela raised an eyebrow, clearly not believing me, but she didn't press the issue. Instead, she gestured to a nearby chair. ""Please, sit. I've been expecting you."""

"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking. Lacerations too, from a Taser—he’d shot at two of the team members who’d come to expatriate him, and a third was forced to fire.","the remaining five had been left with various degrees of physical and mental trauma.

Graham, however, had been one of the lucky ones, with only minor side effects that the doctors had assured him would fade with time. As he sat in his small, sterile apartment, he couldn't help but feel a sense of disorientation. The world outside was unrecognizable, a cacophony of sounds and sights that assaulted his senses. He had been briefed on the changes that had taken place during his absence, but nothing could have prepared him for the reality. The towering skyscrapers that seemed to touch the sky, the strange, sleek vehicles that moved without the aid of horses or steam, the people who stared at small, glowing rectangles in their hands with an intensity that bordered on obsession. It was overwhelming, and Graham often found himself longing for the familiarity of his own time. But he was determined to adapt, to make a new life for himself in this strange new world. He had been given a chance, and he was determined to make the most of it."
"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into","his eighties.

The hallway continued on to a kitchen at the back of the house, with a small pantry and a back door that led out into a narrow yard. Upstairs, there were three bedrooms, each with a small closet, and a bathroom with a tub and a toilet. The house was small, but it was clean and well-maintained, and it was clear that the Ministry had put some effort into making it a comfortable place for Gore to live. Despite its small size, the house had a cozy feel to it, and Gore felt a sense of relief wash over him as he stepped inside and closed the door behind him. He had been living in hotels and temporary accomodations for weeks, and it was nice to finally have a place to call his own, even if it was only temporary."

He was staring at his reflection, his eyes fixed on the lines that had appeared around his mouth over the past year. He took a long drag on his cigarette, the smoke curling up towards the ceiling as he exhaled slowly. The sound of the radio could be heard faintly from the other room, the newsreader's voice a steady drone in the background. Gore's thoughts, however, were elsewhere, his mind preoccupied with the events of the previous day. He had been putting off this moment for weeks, but he knew he could no longer avoid it. With a sigh, he stubbed out his cigarette in the ashtray beside him and stood up, his movements slow and deliberate. He walked over to the sink, turning on the cold water tap and splashing some water over his face, the shock of the cold helping to clear his head. He looked up at his reflection once more, his eyes searching for any sign of weakness, but all he saw was a face set in determination."
"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale.

The smell of smoke and dampness filled the air, a stark contrast to the usual sterile environment. As the team assessed the damage, they knew they had a long day ahead of them, but they were determined to get the facility back up and running as soon as possible. The first order of business was to stop the water leak and assess the damage to the equipment. Gore, still chain-smoking, began to make his way to the supply room to gather the necessary tools, his eyes scanning the area for any other potential hazards. Meanwhile, the rest of the team started to fan out, each one taking on a different task to get the facility back in order. Despite the chaos, they worked together seamlessly, their training and experience kicking in as they tackled the challenges ahead of them."
"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer.

The intricate web of gears, the delicate balance of the escapement, the way the whole thing seemed to whir and hum like a living thing... I can only imagine the look on his face, a mix of fascination and suspicion, as he tried to wrap his head around the sheer complexity of it all. And yet, despite his initial reservations, he was a man of his word, and he'd agreed to take the chronometer on board and put it through its paces. I can only imagine the stories he'd tell, once he'd gotten used to the thing."
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people.

He had a deep love for literature and was particularly fond of the works of Shakespeare and Dickens. His eyes would light up when he talked about the characters and stories, and he could recite entire passages from memory. I was amazed by his vast knowledge and his ability to connect the dots between seemingly unrelated things. As I spent more time with him, I began to realize that his love for learning was not limited to books alone. He had a curiosity about the world around him, and he would often ask me questions about my own interests and passions. His genuine interest in getting to know me as a person was something that I had never experienced before, and it made me feel seen and heard in a way that I had never felt before. As our conversations flowed effortlessly, I found myself opening up to him in ways that I never thought possible. I shared with him my dreams, my fears, and my aspirations, and he listened with a depth of understanding that was both comforting and unsettling at the same time. And as I looked into his eyes, I saw a reflection of myself, a reflection that was both familiar and yet, utterly foreign. It was as if he had a way of seeing me that I had never seen before, a way that was both exhilarating and terrifying. I felt like I was standing at the edge of a cliff, staring into an abyss of unknown possibilities, and yet, I felt a sense of safety, a sense of being held, that I had never felt before. It was as if Gore had a way of holding space for me, a space that was both expansive and intimate, a space that allowed me to be myself, without fear of judgment or rejection. And as I stood there, suspended in that space, I knew that I had found something truly special, something that I had been searching for my entire life, something that I never knew existed."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea.

It was as if he was trying to make sense of the world, to understand the intricacies of human nature. And yet, despite his keen observations, he remained detached, a spectator in the truest sense of the word. He was a man out of time, a relic of a bygone era, and yet, he was also a man of great wisdom and insight. His displacement was not just physical, but also temporal, and it was this that gave him his unique perspective on the world."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake. Another person’s unguardedness in that moment can be very useful, interpersonally, as long as you don’t soften.

I've learned that honesty, no matter how difficult it may seem, is always the best policy, even if it's hard to swallow. The experience with Gore taught me a valuable lesson, one that I'll carry with me for the rest of my life."
Gore lifts his hand.

As he stands there, frozen in thought, the world around him melts away, leaving only the vivid memories of a past that refuses to be forgotten."
"Gore considers the weight of the sack he’d carried, which had felt so meaningful. “Three partridges,”","he says, “and a boatswain gull too far off to hit. Nothing else. Not even tracks.”","he says to himself, the memory of the hunt still fresh in his mind. He recalls the",32,"he says to himself, the memory of the hunt still fresh in his mind.

The image of the partridges, plump and full of life, now seems a distant memory, overshadowed by the harsh realities of his current situation."

He clenched his fist, feeling the familiar surge of adrenaline as his heart rate increased, a reflex he had grown accustomed to over the years. The pain was a reminder of his strength, a testament to his ability to endure. But it was also a reminder of his weakness, a vulnerability he had never been able to shake. He looked away, his eyes drifting to the horizon, searching for a distraction from the turmoil that brewed within him."
The ice outside shifts—the Arctic stammering its jaws as a cat does when it sees a bird. The ship’s cat died in convulsions during,"their second winter. Gore had liked that cat.

He's been at sea for nigh on forty years, but he's never seen the ice behave like this before. It's as if the very fabric of the ocean is unraveling, and he can't shake the feeling that they're sailing into the jaws of the abyss. The crew is on high alert, scanning the horizon for any sign of land, but there's nothing. Just the endless expanse of white, stretching out before them like an empty grave. The ship creaks and groans, the wooden hull protesting the pressure of the ice, and the sailors exchange nervous glances. They know that one wrong move could spell disaster, and they're all thinking the same thing: what if they get stuck here? What if the ice closes in around them, trapping them in this frozen hell? The captain's voice cuts through the tension, his words low and steady. ""Keep scanning, men. We need to find a way out of this before it's too late."" But as he speaks, the ice shifts again, the sound like thunder in the stillness. The sailors exchange fearful glances, and the captain's eyes narrow. He knows that they're running out of time."
"Once we arrived at the Ministry, an escort of subtly armed suits took Gore to meet the other expats. I was expecting he’d","go through a group therapy session, but Gore was in a sunny mood, so he must have been envisaging something closer to a salon.","be ushered into a high-level meeting with the Minister herself, but instead, he was led to a small, unassuming door hidden behind",47,"be ushered into a high-level meeting with the Minister herself, but instead, he was led to a small, unassuming door hidden behind a tapestry.

I was about to turn and leave when the door creaked open again, and Gore's head poked out, his eyes locked on mine with an urgent intensity. ""Wait,"" he whispered, before disappearing back into the room, leaving me standing there, my heart pounding in my chest."

I waited, studying him, trying to decipher what was going on behind those piercing eyes. The silence stretched out, becoming almost palpable, until finally, he spoke, his voice low and measured, ""We have a problem."""

The bistros we frequented were a far cry from the formal dining rooms of yesteryear, with their emphasis on casual, farm-to-table cuisine and inventive presentation. And yet, despite the many changes that had taken place, I couldn't help but feel a deep respect for the traditions that had come before, and a sense of wonder at the endless possibilities that lay ahead."
"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to",take us to”—here he raised his eyebrows—“a public house.

He told me about his family, his friends, and his struggles to make a living as a farmer. I listened intently, feeling a sense of connection to this man who had so graciously taken me in. As the night wore on, I found myself feeling more and more at ease, and I began to share stories of my own life with Gore. We laughed and joked together, and for the first time since my arrival, I felt like I was truly a part of the community. As the evening drew to a close, Gore walked me back to the house, and we stood outside the door, reluctant to say goodnight. ""Thank you for tonight,"" I said, feeling a sense of gratitude towards this kind stranger. ""You're welcome,"" he replied, smiling. ""I'm glad we could get to know each other better.""

As he sat in his cabin, staring at the scar, he couldn't shake the feeling that it was throbbing, as if it was trying to tell him something. He rubbed it absently, trying to clear his head. He had been having strange dreams lately, full of images of the accident, and of the captain, who had died a few years after their adventure together. He had always felt a sense of guilt over the captain's death, wondering if there was anything he could have done to prevent it. Now, as he sat in the darkness, he couldn't help but feel that the past was trying to catch up with him."
"It’s surprising, then, that I allowed Graham’s drawing of the projection device to enter my files as a joke, like a coin minted 70 BC. I thought it was a form of juvenilia, drawn in","his earliest years as a modern man, something to remind him of on a significant anniversary of his arrival here; and not, as it would turn out to be, a red letter from another era.","moments of boredom or distraction, a doodle that would eventually be lost in the depths of my archives.

I wonder what other secrets Graham's drawing might hold, and whether I will ever be able to uncover them. The more I study the drawing, the more I become convinced that it is not just a simple sketch, but a key to unlocking a much larger mystery. I feel a shiver run down my spine as I contemplate the possibilities, and I know that I must learn more about this enigmatic device and its place in the grand tapestry of time."
"By the start of that summer, Graham was practically a native of the era. He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle. Most mornings he rose—hours before me—and",went for a run. He would sometimes wake me up with a juicy smoker’s wheeze on his return to the house.

He had developed a fondness for the music of the time, often listening to vinyl records of Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry while he cooked. As he sat down to eat, he would read the newspaper, taking particular interest in the news of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. His transformation was nothing short of remarkable, and I often found myself marveling at how seamlessly he had adapted to life in the past. Despite the initial culture shock, Graham had grown to love the simplicity and charm of the era, and I couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy at his ability to embrace it all so effortlessly."
"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past. I was prickly and defensive about","this; I could not look at why directly. I heard the way I spoke to him about it: adjustment, reasonable, citizen, responsibility, values.

But Graham would just shake his head and mutter something about the loss of tradition, the erosion of values, and the decline of community. He would talk about the past with a nostalgia that I couldn't quite understand, as if he had left a part of himself back there. I would try to explain to him that we couldn't turn back the clock, that we had to move forward, but he would just look at me with a mixture of sadness and disappointment. It was as if he felt that I was betraying my heritage, that I was abandoning the very things that had made us who we were. I didn't know how to respond to him, how to make him see that progress wasn't a betrayal, but a natural evolution. I felt like I was losing him, like he was slipping away from me, back into the past, and I didn't know how to bring him back."
"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them. Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled","to focus on the tests—eyes moving rapidly.

The expats were seated in comfortable chairs, surrounded by calming colors and soothing music, in an attempt to reduce their stress levels and elicit more accurate responses. Despite these efforts, the results were still inconsistent, and the team began to suspect that the expats' reactions were being influenced by factors beyond their control. They decided to introduce a new variable into the equation, one that would push the expats to their limits and reveal the true depths of their emotional responses. The new test was code-named ""The Isolation Protocol,"" and it would prove to be the most challenging and revelatory experiment of them all."
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons.

"I went along to one of the earliest dinners, chicken bag slung over my shoulder.

As we chatted, I couldn't help but notice the curious glances from the other diners, who seemed to be sizing me up.

"Graham said, “Hm!” and pulled hard on his cigarette.

He was a man on a mission, a man who would stop at nothing to achieve his goal. And I, it seemed, was part of that goal."

As a result, our home was always well-maintained and comfortable, and we were able to create many happy memories there. Looking back, I realize that living in a government-owned residence had its advantages and disadvantages, but overall, it was a unique and valuable experience that taught me a lot about responsibility and community."
"Movement was anathema. I slept, mostly, naked and poaching in my sweat. The water ration forced Graham to switch finally to thirty-second showers.

Graham's decision to ration water had become a necessity, and I couldn't blame him for it. The thirty-second showers were a far cry from the long, luxurious baths I was used to, but they were better than nothing. I began to appreciate the small things - the feel of the water on my skin, the taste of a cool drink, the sound of birds chirping outside the window. It was as if the heat wave had stripped away all the non-essentials, leaving only the bare basics of human existence. And in that, I found a strange sort of peace."
"Adela took bridge meetings in a soundproof room deep in the Ministry’s chest.

Adela was a stickler for punctuality, and woe betide anyone who dared to arrive late or go over their allotted time. Despite the formal atmosphere, however, Adela had a way of putting everyone at ease, her sharp mind and quick wit making even the most mundane discussions seem engaging and relevant. As the meeting drew to a close, Adela would summarize the key points and action items, her eyes scanning the room to ensure everyone was on the same page. And then, with a final nod, she would adjourn the meeting, leaving us to disperse and tackle the tasks assigned to us."
Adela was standing at the sink and anarchically disobeying the water ration by running her wrists under cold,"water. She looked unwell, but God alone knows how her plastic surgeon thought she was supposed to look.","water, feeling the refreshing liquid wash away the sweat and grime of the day's labor.

As she stood there, she felt a sense of freedom, a sense of rebellion against the strict regime that controlled every aspect of her life. But the feeling was short-lived, as she heard the sound of footsteps approaching, and quickly turned off the faucet, feeling a sense of guilt and anxiety wash over her."
"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it,","was a mystery. She didn’t enjoy the prestige, as the Secretary did, and she seemed bizarrely overworked for the proxy boss of a project in its pilot stage.","remained a mystery to us.

Her eyes seemed to bore into our souls, as if searching for any sign of weakness or incompetence. Despite her haughty demeanor, there was something about her that commanded respect, a quiet confidence that was both captivating and intimidating. As we sat in the conference room, waiting for the meeting to begin, I couldn't help but wonder what secrets lay hidden behind those piercing eyes, and what had driven her to apply for a position that seemed so far beneath her obvious capabilities."
"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had","just discovered that a woman with whom he was spending a lot of time would never be interested in him.

"Graham blew smoke out through his nose reflectively. “I see,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s fair to call him ‘grim,’ though you wouldn’t be the","first to say it.

He turned back to the bar, signaling the bartender for another round. ""So, what's the plan for tonight? Are we going to try and take down the entire guild, or just pick off a few stragglers?"""
"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders. The bridges kept turning in their core reports, and the experiments kept running. Given how much of our working day the data collection took, we all assumed that the time-travel project was running to the stated purpose. Every day I had to record his heart rate, his blood pressure, his temperature; every day a written record of what he wore, what he ate, how much","exercise he took; every week checking progress against the imaginary benchmarks set by Control, use of phone, use of transport, use of media and the assessment of how harmful or useful each medium was; all the time the corrective tests for vocabulary and habit; novelistic observations on his character and temperament.

"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events. He’d lain motionless in the garden for two hours, on","a wet and putrid night, to shoot a fox, and pulled out one of his own rotting teeth (he showed it to me afterward; it was the color of a tombstone, caped with gelatinous red)—was this Victorian, or was this “irregularities”?","the same patch of grass where he'd spent the previous afternoon, staring up at the sky.

Salese, on the other hand, seemed oblivious to the stranger's presence, and continued to lecture us on the importance of proper breathing techniques. But I couldn't shake off the feeling that we were being watched, and I found myself glancing over my shoulder, half-expecting to see the stranger reappear.

The thought of waking up each morning to the sound of birds singing, and spending my days reading and writing, with Arthur by my side, is a tantalizing one. And Scotland, with its rugged landscapes and rich history, seems like the perfect place to make that dream a reality.

It's a tantalizing prospect, and one that I hope to make a reality someday soon."

The water continued to lap against the tub, a constant reminder of the simple pleasures in life, and I felt my thoughts begin to untangle, like the knots in a piece of string slowly coming undone. As I stood there, the music, the water, and the silence all blended together, creating a sense of calm that I hadn't felt in a long time."

Anyway, the topic of weed came up, and I mentioned that I had recently read an article about how it was becoming legal in many places, and how it was being used to help people with a variety of health problems. One of my friends, who had always been very much against the use of any kind of drug, was surprised by this, and asked me to tell him more. I explained that I had read that it was being used to help people with chronic pain, and that it was also being used to help people with anxiety and depression. I also mentioned that I had read that it was being used to help people with epilepsy, and that it had been shown to be very effective in reducing the number of seizures that people with epilepsy had. My friend was amazed by this, and asked me where I had read it. I told him that I had read it in a magazine, and that I could give him the name of the magazine if he wanted it. He said that he would like that, and I gave it to him. He then asked me if I thought that it would ever be legal in our country, and I told him that I didn't know, but that I hoped that it would be.

The latter was a tall, thin man, with a pale face and a very large Adam's apple, which bobbed up and down as he talked. He was dressed in black, and his clothes were all worn and shiny. He looked like a lawyer's clerk, and I set him down as such in my own mind. His name, as I afterwards heard, was Mr. Jabez Wilson, and he was a solicitor, who had come down from London on business connected with the estate of the late Mr. McFarlane. He was a very nervous, fidgety man, and he kept glancing about the room with his eyes, as if he feared that some one was watching him. My host and hostess were talking to him in low tones, and they all stopped as I came in. I bade them good morning, and they all bade me good morning, and we sat down to breakfast. The conversation was rather stiff at first, but it soon became more general, and we talked about the weather, and the crops, and other such like matters. Mr. Wilson was a very agreeable man, and he had a good deal to say for himself. He was a well-read man, and he had a good understanding of the world. I was very much pleased with him, and I thought that he was a very suitable man to have about the place."

She had a sharp tongue and a quick wit, and she wasn't afraid to use them. As she walked into the room, she could feel the expats looking at her, sizing her up. But Adela didn't back down. She stood tall, her head held high, and her eyes flashing with a fierce inner light. She was a force to be reckoned with, and she knew it. The expats, on the other hand, were a different story altogether. They were a motley crew, each one more arrogant and entitled than the last. They looked at Adela with a mixture of disdain and amusement, clearly thinking that she was some kind of joke. But Adela wasn't a joke. She was a woman on a mission, and she wasn't going to let anyone get in her way."
"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs. Given the prevalence of prostitution in Victorian England, the nonexistence of reliable barrier contraception in his era, and the fact that he was a sailor, this suggested he was either a virgin or very lucky.

The analyst had noted that Graham's responses to questions about sex were always laced with a sense of moral disapproval, and that he seemed to view sex as something dirty and degrading. I couldn't help but wonder what had led Graham to develop such a warped view of sex, and whether it was connected to his mysterious past. As I delved deeper into the report, I began to feel a sense of unease. What other secrets was Graham hiding, and how would they impact our already complicated relationship? I knew I had to confront him about this, but I was unsure of how he would react. Would he become defensive and withdrawn, or would he finally open up to me about his true feelings? I decided to approach the conversation with caution, but also with a sense of determination. I needed to understand Graham, and I was willing to do whatever it took to get to the bottom of his secrets."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory.

It was as if the entire world had been reduced to this small, stuffy room, and the only thing that mattered was the exchange of ideas between us. I felt a thrill run through me as I realized that I had the power to shape their perceptions, to mold their understanding of the world. It was a heady feeling, and one that I wasn't sure I was entirely comfortable with. But as I looked at Margaret, I knew that I couldn't help myself. I was drawn to her, to the blank slate that was her mind, and I couldn't wait to see what I could create. I took a deep breath, and began to speak, my words pouring out of me like water from a fountain. I told her of the world, of its beauty and its ugliness, of its complexity and its simplicity. I told her of the people, of their struggles and their triumphs, of their hopes and their fears. And as I spoke, I watched her face, saw the understanding dawn in her eyes, saw the wonder grow. It was a truly magical thing, and one that I would never forget. As I finished speaking, the room was silent, the only sound the quiet hum of the air conditioner. Margaret looked at me, her eyes shining with a newfound understanding, and I knew that I had done something truly special. I had taken a blank slate, and I had created something beautiful."

"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled. Then again, whose upper management am I not describing? Who trusts their workplace? Who thinks their job is on the side of right?

But now, as I look back, I wonder if I was just blinded by my own desperation. Was I so eager to believe her that I ignored the warning signs? I don't know. All I know is that I made a choice, and now I have to live with the consequences. The tram is still moving, carrying us closer and closer to our destination. I can feel the weight of the lever in my hand, and I know that I'll have to make another choice soon. But for now, I can only sit here, frozen in uncertainty, as the city rushes past us like a dark and endless river."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.","for a person to be in two places at once.

It was an incredible feeling, and I was eager to share it with Graham. But he just wouldn't believe me. He thought I was crazy, that I had finally lost my mind. But I knew the truth, and I was determined to prove it to him."
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.","his lips, blowing out a stream of smoke as he stared intently at a piece of paper in front of him.

I could see that it was a letter, but I couldn't make out the words from where I was standing. I felt a sudden surge of curiosity, wondering who it could be from and what it could be about. Graham looked up as I entered, a mixture of emotions on his face, and for a moment we just looked at each other, the only sound the quiet hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen. Then, without a word, he handed me the letter, his eyes never leaving mine. I took it, feeling a strange sense of trepidation as I unfolded it and began to read. The words danced on the page, but as I focused, they began to make sense, and with each sentence, my heart sank a little lower. It was from an old friend, one we had both known since childhood, and the news it carried was not good. I looked up to see Graham watching me, his expression somber, and I knew that he already knew. We stood there for a moment, the weight of the news settling around us like a shroud, before I finally spoke, my voice barely above a whisper. ""What are we going to do?"" I asked, feeling a sense of helplessness wash over me. Graham's face hardened, a determination in his eyes, and he replied, ""We'll do what we have to. We'll face it together, like we always do."" And in that moment, I knew that no matter what lay ahead, we would indeed face it, side by side, as we had always done."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers. He took in anecdotes about my childhood meals as if they would contribute to a portrait of a whole woman. He ignored the fact that mostly I cooked assorted chicken pieces on rice. I could tell him things about galangal, and he found that very profound.","and reception towers.

He was fascinated by the way the flavors melded together, the balance of sweet and sour, the crunch of fresh herbs. I watched as he carefully noted down the ingredients and techniques my mother used, his eyes lighting up with excitement whenever he discovered a new combination. His interest in Southeast Asian food was not just about taste, but about the culture and history behind each dish. He saw the food as a reflection of the people, their traditions and values. As he cooked, he would tell me stories about the different regions, the history of the dishes, and the people who created them. His passion was infectious, and soon I found myself caught up in his enthusiasm, eager to learn more about the food and the culture that had been a part of my life for so long. Together, we experimented with new recipes, combining traditional techniques with modern twists, creating something unique and innovative. The kitchen became a laboratory, a place of discovery and creativity, where the boundaries of culture and cuisine blurred. As we cooked, the aromas wafting from the pots and pans, Graham would sketch the dishes, capturing the essence of the food and the culture that inspired it. His art and my mother's cooking had merged, creating something new and beautiful, a reflection of the diversity and richness of Southeast Asian culture."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization.

I had visions of him in a desk job, perhaps in procurement or human resources, where he could utilize his exceptional organizational skills and still be home every night for dinner. However, he was resolute in his decision to rejoin the navy, and I couldn't blame him. The navy had been his life for so long, and the thought of starting over in a new career was daunting. I knew that if he didn't try to rejoin, he would always wonder what could have been. So, I supported his decision, even though it meant that our lives would be put on hold once again. We began the arduous process of updating his records, getting his physical, and going through the lengthy application process. It was a stressful time, but we were determined to make it work. Meanwhile, I started looking for a job myself, something that would allow me to use my skills and experience, and also give me the flexibility to support my husband's career. I was excited at the prospect of starting a new chapter in our lives, but I was also nervous about the unknowns that lay ahead. Would we be able to adjust to life back in the States? Would we be able to find jobs that we loved? Would we be able to rebuild our lives and create a new sense of normalcy? Only time would tell."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.","The upbeat melody filled the room, a stark contrast to the tense atmosphere that had settled over the group.

The others, however, couldn't help but exchange amused glances, the absurdity of the situation momentarily breaking the tension. As the song reached its climax, Graham finally noticed the distraction he had created and hastily muted the volume, his face flushing slightly with embarrassment. The sudden silence that followed was almost deafening, and the group refocused their attention on the task at hand, the brief interlude forgotten in the face of the daunting challenge that lay before them."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes. One of his first searches was charmingly housewifely: “Most challenging recipes”; “How to make cheese soufflé”; “What is miso paste?”; “Where to buy miso paste”; “How long has Japan been open to Europe?” A day or so after I’d read this report, I received another that listed the following search terms:","and that I'd have to sit him down for a talk about the birds and the bees, or rather, the birds and the browser history.

It seemed that Graham had developed a fascination with the clicking of the needles and the gentle rhythm of creating something warm and fuzzy from a ball of yarn. I couldn't help but chuckle at the thought of this tough, gruff man, who had spent years working on the toughest cases, now cozied up with a pair of knitting needles and a half-finished scarf. I made a mental note to tease him about it later, but for now, I was just relieved that my worst fears had not been confirmed. Little did I know, however, that this was only the beginning of a strange and unexpected journey, one that would take us both down a path of discovery and growth, and would change our lives forever."
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing,","as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday. This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option. We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit. Still, we had not told them about the death camps.","but to me it just looked like panic. I waded through the icy water, my wellies instantly soaked, and made my way to the house.

It's always better to be upfront and honest, don't you think?"" I bit back a retort, not wanting to engage in a battle of wits with her. ""Yeah, definitely,"" I said instead, trying to sound agreeable. ""Well, I should probably get going then,"" I said, wanting to end the conversation. ""Yeah, you should,"" Adela agreed.
