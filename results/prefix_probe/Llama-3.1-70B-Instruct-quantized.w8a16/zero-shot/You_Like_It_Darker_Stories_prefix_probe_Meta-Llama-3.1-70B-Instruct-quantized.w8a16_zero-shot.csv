As the years went by, his popularity only grew, and I was constantly fielding calls from publishers, producers, and other industry professionals clamoring to work with him.

"“Butch and I were kids going to a one-room schoolhouse before the Second World War. We grew up in a no-stoplight dirt-road town fixing cars, patching them up, playing sports and then coaching them.

"So that was what I did, although something about the way Pop looked just then stuck with me.

I didn't know what to make of it at the time, but it stuck with me, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. I tried to push it to the back of my mind, but it lingered, a nagging sense of unease that I couldn't quite explain.

"I read a review of Pop’s first book, The Lightning Storm, and the reviewer said this: “Not much happens in the","first hundred or so pages of Mr. Carmody’s suspenseful yarn, but the reader is drawn on anyway, because there are violins.”","book, but what does happen is told in a way that makes you feel like you're right there with the characters, experiencing everything",42,"book, but what does happen is told in a way that makes you feel like you're right there with the characters, experiencing everything they're going through. The reviewer went on to say that Pop's writing style is very descriptive and immersive, and that he has a talent for creating vivid imagery with his words. I was intrigued by this review and decided to check out the book for myself. As I began reading, I could see what the reviewer meant - the story does unfold at a leisurely pace, but the way Pop describes the setting and the characters' emotions really draws you in. I found myself becoming completely absorbed in the world of the story, and I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next. I was a bit skeptical at first, but as I kept reading, I realized that the slow pace of the story was actually a strength, not a weakness. It allowed me to really get to know the characters and become invested in their lives, and it made the plot twists and turns all the more surprising and impactful. Overall, I was really impressed with The Lightning Storm, and I'm excited to see what Pop will come out with next."
"I knew a lot of this. I learned more from Ruth Crawford herself at the Korner Koffee Kup, across the street from the Gateway Motel and just about a block down from the post office.

She had a way of making everyone feel like family, and Pop was no exception. As we sipped our coffee, Ruth would regale us with stories of the town's history and the latest gossip. I was fascinated by her tales of the old days, of the pioneers who settled this land and the struggles they faced. Pop would listen intently, nodding his head and making supportive noises, his eyes twinkling with amusement. Those were special moments, just the two of us, enjoying each other's company and the warm hospitality of the Korner Koffee Kup."
"It was Ruth Crawford, looking slim and trim in white slacks, a pink shell top, and a matching mask—that was the second year","of Covid.

""It's so great to see you!"" she exclaimed, her eyes shining with genuine delight. We hadn't seen each other in months, not since the lockdown had eased and we'd both started venturing out again. We'd kept in touch through phone calls and video chats, but it wasn't the same as being together in person. I was struck by how good she looked, how relaxed and happy. The past year had been tough on all of us, but Ruth seemed to have weathered it particularly well. As we hugged, I noticed a man standing behind her, watching us with a friendly smile. ""This is John,"" Ruth said, turning to him. ""We met through mutual friends a few months ago."" John was tall and lanky, with a rugged, outdoorsy look that suggested he spent a lot of time hiking or camping. He had a firm handshake and a warm smile, and I liked him immediately. The three of us chatted for a few minutes, catching up on each other's news, before the hostess came over to show us to our table."
"“Not bad. As you must know, since you’re staying right across the street.","The muffins are better. But still no interview.

The local newspaper would feature him on the front page every year, with a photo of him holding the coveted Golden Pie trophy and a proud smile on his face. I even found an old interview where Dave claimed that his secret to winning was a special stomach exercise he developed over the years, which allowed him to expand his stomach capacity to inhuman limits. The townspeople would often talk about how Dave's pie-eating skills were a gift from God, and how he brought pride and joy to their small community. As I dug deeper, I realized that Dave's legacy extended far beyond the town fair, and that his name became synonymous with pie-eating excellence, inspiring generations of competitive eaters to come."

When I finally got through to my mom, she told me that my grandfather had passed away. I remember feeling a mix of emotions - sadness, shock, and a sense of loss. My grandfather had been a significant figure in my life, and his passing left a void that could never be filled. I spent the rest of the day in a daze, trying to come to terms with the news, and wondering what the future held without him. The days that followed were a blur of funeral arrangements, family gatherings, and trying to support my family through a difficult time. Looking back, I realize that my grandfather's passing was a turning point in my life, one that taught me the value of family, the importance of cherishing the time we have with loved ones, and the need to make the most of every moment."

I try to shake off the feeling, telling myself it's just my imagination, but the air seems to vibrate with an otherworldly energy. Suddenly, a faint humming noise catches my attention, and I turn to see a figure emerging from the shadows. It's a woman, tall and gaunt, with eyes that seem to bore into my very soul. She's dressed in tattered black, and a crown of twisted thorns sits atop her head. I feel a chill run down my spine as she begins to speak, her voice low and husky. ""Welcome, travelers,"" she says. ""I see you're lost. I can help you find your way... for a price."""

""Why, to live in, of course,"" she replied, as if it was obvious. I couldn't help but wonder what had brought this on. Ruth had always been a bit of a loner, content to keep to herself, but this seemed like a whole new level of eccentricity, even for her. I decided to humor her, though, and offered to help her with the renovations. Little did I know, it would be the start of a whole new chapter in my life."
"Two days after our off-the-record talk in the Koffee Kup, she came slow-rolling down Benson Street, and instead of driving past, she pulled over and stopped right next to the little signs on either side of the gate.

"“Hunting in the 30-Mile,” he said promptly. “We went the second week of November from the time we were teenagers right up until Butch mounted his steel pony and set sail for the golden west.

But even though he was gone, I continued to make the trip to the cabin every year, always hoping that he would return and we could resume our hunting trips together. The cabin remained unchanged over the years, a testament to the memories that we had made there. The same old wooden table and chairs, the same fireplace, the same loft where we would sleep.

And even though Butch never did return, I knew that he would always be with me in spirit, every time I stepped foot in that cabin."

Butch started across.

I mean, I was a good kid, I wasn't a bad person, but I just didn't have the motivation to do the work. And I think that's true for a lot of people. I think a lot of people get through college by the skin of their teeth, and they don't really learn anything. And I think that's a shame, because college is a great opportunity to learn and grow, and if you're not taking advantage of it, then you're really missing out. But, you know, I'm not proud of the way I got through college. I'm proud of the fact that I graduated, but I'm not proud of the way I did it. And I think that's something that I'll always regret. I wish I had taken my education more seriously, and I wish I had worked harder. But, you know, hindsight is 20/20, and you can't change the past. All you can do is move forward and try to do better in the future. And that's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to take my life more seriously, and I'm trying to work harder. And I'm hoping that I'll be able to look back on my life and be proud of what I've accomplished."
"It’s a bad dream. Danny’s had a few before, everyone has a nightmare from time to time, but this is the worst one ever. Nothing bad is happening","at first, but that doesn’t help; the sense of impending doom is so strong it’s an actual taste in his mouth, like sucking on a clump of pennies.","yet, but the feeling of dread is suffocating.

He's trying to wake up, but his body feels heavy, as if it's stuck in the mud. He's aware of his surroundings, but everything seems distorted, like a funhouse mirror reflection. The room is spinning, and he's struggling to catch his breath. Suddenly, he hears a faint whispering in his ear, a soft, raspy voice that sends shivers down his spine. ""You can't wake up, Danny,"" it says. ""You're trapped here, forever."" Danny's heart is racing, and he's desperate to escape, but his limbs won't move. He's paralyzed with fear, unable to scream, unable to breathe. The whispering grows louder, more urgent, and Danny feels himself being pulled down, down, down into a dark abyss, with no escape in sight."
He’s walking along the shoulder of a dirt road that’s been packed and oiled to keep the dust down. It’s night. A quarter moon has just risen. To Danny it looks like a sideways grin. Or a sneer. He passes a sign reading,"COUNTY ROAD F, only the O and the Y have been spraypainted over, and UCK has been crammed in to the right of the F, so the sign now reads CUNT ROAD FUCK. There are a couple of bullet holes for good measure.","Welcome to Redemption, Population 2,456"". The sign creaks in the gentle breeze, and Danny can't help but feel a sense of irony.

The sign creaks in the gentle breeze, and Danny can't help but feel a sense of irony. He's been walking for hours, and the only thing he's been redeemed from is the confines of the prison he escaped from. The dirt road stretches out before him, a seemingly endless path to nowhere. He can see the faint lights of a town in the distance, but it's still a ways off. He takes a deep breath, feeling the cool night air fill his lungs, and continues on. The quarter moon casts long shadows across the ground, making it seem like he's walking through a tunnel of darkness. He's been on his own for so long now, he's started to feel like he's the only person left in the world. The silence is oppressive, punctuated only by the sound of his own footsteps and the occasional hoot of an owl in the distance. He's lost track of time, doesn't know what day it is or what time it is. All he knows is that he has to keep moving. He's got a destination in mind, a place he's been heading towards for weeks now. He's not even sure if it's still there, or if it's just a myth, a rumor. But it's all he's got to hold onto, the only thing that's keeping him going. He's got a name, a face, a memory. And he's going to find her, no matter what it takes."
"There’s corn on both sides of the road, not as high as an elephant’s eye but maybe four feet, suggesting it’s early summer.

He tries to shake off the feeling, telling himself it's just his imagination playing tricks on him, but the sense of dread only intensifies as they get closer. The building appears to be some sort of old farmhouse, its paint chipped and faded, the windows boarded up. A rusty old windmill stands sentinel beside it, its blades creaking ominously in the gentle breeze. As they crest the rise, Danny can see that the building seems to be surrounded by a tangle of overgrown fields and scrubby trees, giving the whole scene a sense of abandonment and decay. Suddenly, the car sputters and dies, plunging them into an unsettling silence."

As he walks, he can't shake the feeling that something is off, that something is watching him, but he pushes the thought aside, telling himself he's just being paranoid. He's been on edge lately, ever since the strange occurrences started happening around him, but he's determined to not let it get to him, to not let fear take over. He quickens his pace, his eyes scanning the crowded streets, searching for a distraction, something to take his mind off the strange feeling that's been following him. He spots a small café up ahead, the sign reading ""Open 24/7"" and he makes his way towards it, hoping to find some solace in a cup of coffee and the hum of conversation."

A lone shopping cart, its wheels bent and twisted, stands like a skeletal sentinel, a haunting reminder of the life that once thrived here.

The student and faculty parking lots of Wilder High are almost completely empty because school let out some weeks earlier.

The building, once a hub of activity, now stands quiet and still, its windows like empty eyes staring back at him. Danny can't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him as he approaches the doors, remembering the countless days he's spent within those walls, the laughter, the tears, the memories. He pushes open the door, and steps inside, the creaking of the hinges breaking the silence. The hallway, once filled with the sound of lockers slamming and students chatting, is now empty and quiet, the only sound the soft hum of the fluorescent lights overhead. Danny's footsteps echo off the walls as he makes his way to his locker, the combination lock clicking open with a familiar metallic sound. He swings open the door, and is hit with the familiar smell of old books and stale air. He reaches in, and pulls out a stack of books, the weight of them familiar in his arms. He closes the locker, and begins to make his way to the library, the silence of the hallway a stark contrast to the chaos that usually fills the air."

"“Yup, yup. On the other hand, you paid cash for it,” Jalbert says, as if just passing the time. “That was","smart. Without the security camera video, we might have taken quite awhile to find you.

“Just this one time!” Jalbert is trying to sound amazed. His eyes aren’t,amazed. They crawl back and forth across Danny’s face. They almost have weight. “One!”,"wide with wonder, but rather narrowed in a mixture of frustration and desperation. He's",27,"wide with wonder, but rather narrowed in a mixture of frustration and desperation. He's been trying to convince his sister, Elara, to let him borrow her prized possession, a rare and precious gemstone, for what felt like an eternity. Elara, however, was not one to be easily swayed, and Jalbert knew it. He had tried every trick in the book, from puppy dog eyes to elaborate promises, but she remained unmoved. This time, though, Jalbert was determined to succeed, no matter the cost. He took a deep breath, letting his words spill out in a passionate plea, hoping against hope that this time, just this one time, Elara would see things his way."

I take the camera, feeling a surge of adrenaline as I prepare to capture the evidence that could change everything. I make my way to the back of the house, camera at the ready, and wait for the pickup to arrive."
"For the first time Jalbert’s smile looks real. In a low, almost caressing voice, he says,",“I think you did. I know you did.

But the warmth of his smile is infectious, and you find yourself taking his arm, feeling a sense of excitement and trepidation as you step into the unknown with this enigmatic stranger."

As they drive, the buildings become fewer and farther between, until they are surrounded by nothing but open fields and dense woods. Jalbert doesn't say a word, his eyes fixed on the road ahead, his jaw clenched in concentration. She looks over at him, wondering what's going through his mind, but his expression gives nothing away. The silence between them is palpable, thick with unspoken thoughts and unanswered questions. She tries to break it, to ask him where they're going, but the words catch in her throat. Something about the atmosphere, the tension in Jalbert's body, makes her hesitate. So she sits back, her eyes fixed on the passing landscape, and waits."
"She heads out. Jalbert gives her a wave and then heads to his room, giving his Chevy Caprice a pat on the way by.

The smell of stale cigarettes and last night's beer still clings to him, but he doesn't notice. He's too busy thinking about the phone call he received earlier that day, the one that had him agreeing to meet up with some old acquaintances at the local waterin' hole. He hasn't seen them in years, not since the incident, and he's not sure what to expect. He shrugs it off, figuring he'll just have to wait and see. He grabs his keys and heads back out, locking the door behind him. The Chevy's engine roars to life as he pulls out of the driveway, the eagle on the hood seeming to soar as he hits the open road."
"The two-room suite, far from fancy, is what’s known as “Kansas plain.” There’s a smell of disinfectant and a fainter smell of mold.

It's not exactly the kind of scenery that inspires the soul, but it's better than the view from his office window back in Chicago. He lets the curtain fall back into place and turns his attention to the briefcase, which is still lying on the carpet where he dropped it. He'll need to get to work on those papers sooner or later, but for now, he just can't muster up the energy. Instead, he heads over to the TV and flips it on, scrolling through the channels until he finds a mindless sitcom that he can zone out to. The laugh track is grating, but it's better than the silence, which seems to be pressing in on him from all sides. He flops down onto the bed, feeling the softness envelop him, and lets out a deep sigh. It's not the Ritz, but it's home for the night."

We sat down in the living room and he started asking me about my whereabouts on the nights of the burglaries. I told him I was at home, alone, and he just nodded and took some notes. Then he asked to take a look around the house, and I showed him around. He seemed particularly interested in my office, where I keep all my important documents and valuables.

Then, when I had finished, he would proceed to tell me why my ideas were wrong and his were right. It was a ritual we went through every time, and I have to admit, I rather enjoyed it. Despite his sometimes gruff exterior, Greg had a heart of gold and was one of the fairest and most honest men I have ever met in the advertising business. I was sad to see him go, but I knew he was ready for a change and I was happy for him."

The twins, Jack and Lily, sat quietly in the backseat, their eyes fixed on the fading outline of their family's farmhouse as it disappeared into the distance. They had been waiting for this day for what felt like an eternity, and now that it was finally here, they couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions: excitement for the adventure that lay ahead, but also a deep sadness at leaving behind the only home they had ever known. As the truck rumbled on, the landscape outside their windows began to shift and change, the rolling hills and green pastures giving way to dense forests and winding streams. Their mother, her eyes fixed on the road ahead, seemed lost in thought, the lines on her face etched deeper than usual, a testament to the weight of the decision that had brought them to this moment. The twins exchanged a nervous glance, their minds racing with questions about what the future held, but for now, they just sat back, held hands, and watched as the world outside their little bubble began to expand in ways they never could have imagined."

The men stopped in front of me, their faces expressionless, and held out the snakes. I took a step back, my heart racing, and tried to speak, but my voice caught in my throat. One of the men gestured to the snakes, then to me, and I realized they wanted me to take them. I hesitated, unsure of what to do, but something about their expectant expressions made me reach out and take the snakes. As soon as I did, the men turned and walked away, leaving me standing there, holding the snakes and wondering what I was supposed to do with them. I looked down at the snakes, which were still squirming and coiling in my hands, and felt a sense of unease wash over me. I had no idea what the men had intended, or what the snakes were for, but I knew I had to get rid of them. I looked around, trying to decide what to do, and that was when I saw her. She was standing a little ways off, watching me with an intent expression. I felt a jolt of surprise, and my grip on the snakes tightened. Who was she, and what did she want? I took a step forward, the snakes still in my hands, and she didn't move. I took another step, and another, until I was standing right in front of her. She looked up at me, her eyes locked on mine, and I felt a shiver run down my spine. ""What do you want?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. She didn't answer, just kept looking at me, and I felt a sense of unease growing inside me. I didn't know what to do, or what she wanted, but I knew I had to get out of there, and fast. I turned and ran, the snakes still in my hands, and didn't stop until I was back in my own world, the snakes still squirming and coiling in my grasp."
"I said, “It’s a song about a woman who keeps looking for her long-gone lover. Mrs.","Bell liked to push around her twins, although they were also long-gone.

As I sang, I closed my eyes and imagined the woman, walking alone on a deserted beach, the wind blowing through her hair, her eyes scanning the horizon for a glimpse of the one she loved. The notes seemed to echo through the empty halls of the old mansion, and I felt a shiver run down my spine. When I finished, there was a moment of silence, and then applause, polite but restrained. I opened my eyes to find my audience, a group of stern-faced old men and women, smiling at me, their faces softening for a moment. One of them, a tall, thin man with a kind face, approached me, and said, ""Well done, child. You have a gift."" I beamed with pride, feeling a sense of accomplishment wash over me."

These hyenas are not necessarily motivated by hunger or poverty, but rather by a desire for excitement and a sense of power. They may even take pleasure in the fear and anxiety they cause to the family, who are already vulnerable and grieving. In some cases, these hyenas may even go as far as to steal valuable items, not just food, but also jewelry, electronics, and other precious belongings. They may also vandalize the property, breaking windows, doors, and other fixtures, just for the sake of causing chaos and destruction. It's a disturbing trend, and one that highlights the need for increased security measures to protect the vulnerable, and to hold these hyenas accountable for their actions."
"By the time I got back to the house, I was hungry. No, ravenous. I scrambled up four eggs and toasted another English muffin. Donna would have said my hunger was healthy, life-affirming, a spit in the eye of death, but maybe I was just hungry.

I carried the plate to the table by the window and sat down, feeling the warm sun on my face. As I ate, I watched the birds flitting about in the trees, their songs filling the air. It was a peaceful scene, one that I had witnessed many times before, but it felt different now. Maybe it was the contrast to the darkness I had faced, or maybe it was something more. Whatever it was, it felt good, and for a moment, I let myself get lost in it. I savored each bite of my food, each breath of the fresh air, and each note of the birds' songs. It was a small moment of joy, but it was enough to remind me that there was still beauty in the world, still things to be appreciated. And as I finished my meal and pushed the plate away, I felt a sense of gratitude for this small, peaceful moment, and for the reminder that even in the darkest times, there is always something to be found, something to be cherished."
It was the shirts. Touching the shirts. And the part about Tad? Those were my own memories intruding on whatever vibe I’d been getting from those shirts.

And as he held the shirt up against himself, a look of satisfaction spreading across his face, I couldn't help but think back to all the times I had done the same, standing in front of the mirror, trying on different looks, searching for the perfect fit. It was a ritual, a rite of passage, and one that I was grateful to see my son embracing with such enthusiasm.

Pelley took no chances. He took a mask out of his voluminous shorts and put it on as soon as we were inside. I got him icewater and poured myself more coffee. I thought about donning my own mask,"and decided not to. I wanted him to see my whole face. We sat at the kitchen table.

""I'm fine too,"" he said. ""Just being cautious. We can't afford to take any chances with this stuff."" I nodded in agreement, feeling a twinge of unease. We sat there in silence for a moment, the only sound the hum of the lab equipment and the soft beeping of the computers. Then Pelley spoke up, his voice low and serious. ""We need to get to the bottom of this, man. Find out what's going on and put a stop to it before it's too late."" I nodded, feeling a surge of determination.

As the night wore on, the sound of pickaxes striking the asphalt and the hum of machinery filled the air, punctuated by the occasional shout or murmur from the workers. It was as if they were driven by a sense of purpose, a sense of urgency that neither Pelley nor the gathered crowd could quite comprehend. And yet, despite the commotion, despite the chaos, there was an eerie sense of calm that pervaded the scene, a sense that this was all just a part of some larger, more complex plan."
Devereaux began to shiver all over like a man suffering a fit of ague. His legs jittered and scissored. His back arched. His midsection rose from the couch and thumped,"down and rose again.

His eyes, which had been fixed on some point in front of him, now darted wildly around the room, as if searching for an escape from the torment that had taken hold of his body.

His hands, which had been clenched into fists, now relaxed, and his arms flailed limply at his sides, as if he had lost all control over his limbs. The shivering and jittering continued unabated, and his body began to convulse, as if he was being shaken by some unseen hand. Suddenly, a low, keening wail issued from his lips, and his body arched again, this time more violently than before, as if he was being stretched on some invisible rack. The wail grew louder and more intense, and his body continued to convulse and shiver, as if he was in the grip of some terrible and merciless force."

As he strolled, he stumbled upon a small wooden dock, where a old man was sitting, fishing. The old man looked up at him and nodded in greeting. He sat down beside the old man, and they started a conversation about life, fishing, and the beauty of nature. The old man shared stories about the lake's history and the secrets it held. He listened intently, feeling a sense of calmness and clarity that he hadn't felt in a long time. The conversation lasted for hours, and by the time he got back to his cabin, he had made a decision about his future."
