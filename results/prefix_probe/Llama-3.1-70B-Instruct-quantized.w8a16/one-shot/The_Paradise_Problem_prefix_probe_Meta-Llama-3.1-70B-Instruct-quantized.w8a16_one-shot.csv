His good looks and charming personality have always made him a popular figure on campus, and I've often found myself introducing him to my other friends and acquaintances. But despite his outgoing nature, Jake has always been a bit of a mystery to me, a reminder that even the people we think we know the best can still surprise us."

I'll start making the guest list and you can start looking for the perfect wedding dress. This is going to be the best day of our lives!"
"“Anna?” he says, like he’s not entirely sure, and then does a full top-to-bottom sweep of my body, which recalls the lack of pants.","When he digs his hand into his luscious head of hair, I forget to be embarrassed again, because it all comes back to me.","His eyes linger on my legs, and I can feel a flush rise to my cheeks as I realize I'm still standing there in just my underwear.",48,"His eyes linger on my legs, and I can feel a flush rise to my cheeks as I realize I'm still standing there in just my underwear.

I feel a surge of embarrassment and try to think of something to say, but my mind is a complete blank. I just stand there, frozen, as he takes a step closer to me, his eyes never leaving mine."
The expression he makes is like the meme of that one kid who smiles and then immediately bursts into tears.,West is staring at me like he’s doomed but must pretend to be happy about it. “Anna.

There was a part of him that he kept hidden, a part that he only revealed in fleeting moments, and it was that part that I was desperate to uncover."
"“I definitely need to go back to the beginning,” I say, wiping my eyes. I mime an explosion at my temples. “Like—my mind is blown right now. You dressed like a middle schooler around the house.

I glance around the room, taking in the opulent decor and the stunning view of the city skyline. ""So, uh, how does one go about being a secret billionaire?"" I ask, trying to sound nonchalant despite the fact that my mind is still reeling from the revelation. West chuckles and leans back in his chair, a sly grin spreading across his face. ""Well, it's not all fun and games, let me tell you,"" he says, a hint of amusement dancing in his eyes. ""But I suppose it has its perks."" He pauses, studying me for a moment before continuing. ""You know, I think it's time I showed you the real reason I brought you here."" He pushes a button on his desk, and the room begins to shift and change around us, revealing a hidden panel and a set of stairs leading down into darkness.

"He looks me over again, top to bottom, and the defeat in his eyes makes me realize the true extent of my unshowered, feral chaos. “Actually,","Anna,” he says, “I need you to come with me to my sister’s wedding in Indonesia and convincingly play the part of my very loving wife.”","I think you might be the most interesting thing that's happened to me all week,” he says, his voice low and smooth, like honey dripping",52,"“I think you might be the most interesting thing that's happened to me all week,” he says, his voice low and smooth, like honey dripping from a spoon.

"It’s surreal to be here with her after all this time. I was so close to being done with this, so near to the finish line, yet here I am, having to improvise an intricate plan B at the eleventh hour with a Muppet in human form as my co-conspirator. Don’t get me wrong, beneath the baked, unshowered disarray, Anna is still a beautiful woman, with enormous brown eyes, creamy skin, and long, willowy limbs. I’d always been fascinated with the perfect beauty mark just above her lip. Unfortunately, right now she looks like","she’s fallen out of a tree and crawled through a field of tangly briers to get back to her apartment. This is probably the closest I’ve ever seen to her natural hair color because the pink has grown out a good inch, leaving a stripe of brown at her roots.

Her eyes are enormous and bright, framed with dark lashes, her steady gaze entirely without artifice.","she just rolled out of a dumpster behind a fast food joint.

""Okay, Anna, here's what we're going to do,"" I say, trying to sound confident and in control. ""We're going to get out of here, and then we're going to get you cleaned up and into some decent clothes. And then we're going to figure out our next move."" Anna looks up at me, her eyes cloudy with a mixture of desperation and hope. ""And then what?"" she asks, her voice barely above a whisper. I hesitate, unsure of what to say. I don't have a plan beyond getting us out of this immediate situation. I don't know what the future holds, or what we're going to do once we're safe.

"As roommates, we didn’t know each other well—that much is probably obvious—but there is an intimacy to sharing a space with someone, a certain kind of kinship that comes with daily proximity. Anna was reasonably tidy and paid her half of the rent when it was due, but she’d never struck me as the organized, driven, premed type.

And yet, as I stood there, staring at the empty space where her bed used to be, I felt a pang of something like loss, like I was mourning the absence of a person I'd never really known. It was a strange, disorienting feeling, like the floor had shifted beneath my feet and I was struggling to find my balance. I thought about all the times we'd passed each other in the hallway, exchanging brief, friendly smiles, and how those moments now seemed freighted with a significance I'd never intended. I thought about the way she'd always kept to herself, the way she'd never imposed on me or asked for anything, and how that had made me assume she was just a solitary person, a loner.

And I'm not sure if I'm ready for it, if I'm ready to deal with the consequences of her actions. But at the same time, I feel a sense of pride, of wonder, at the sheer audacity of it all. She's my daughter, and I love her, no matter what."
"“Okay, okay. I’m on my way.” Slinging her purse over my shoulder and collecting our carry-ons, I make my way to the ladies’ room, where","Anna peeks out into the hallway. As soon as she sees me, she reaches forward, grabbing the front of my shirt and jerking me inside.","I quickly splash some water on my face, trying to shake off the lingering fatigue from the long flight.

As I'm reapplying my makeup, I notice a woman staring at me from across the room. She looks vaguely familiar, but I just can't quite place her. I flash her a polite smile and turn back to the mirror, wondering if maybe we were on the same flight. Just as I'm finishing up, my phone buzzes with a text from Alex: ""Hey, just landed. Where r u?"" I quickly type out a response, ""In the ladies' room, be right out,"" and slip my phone back into my purse. As I'm about to exit, the woman approaches me. ""Excuse me,"" she says, ""but aren't you...?"""
Apologizing over her shoulder to a woman washing her hands at the sink—“I swear we,aren’t going to have sex in here!”—Anna pulls me into a stall and flips the lock.,"didn't mean to cut you off like that, I just really need to get going, I'm running",31,"didn't mean to cut you off like that, I just really need to get going, I'm running so behind schedule already and I still have to stop by the grocery store on my way home to pick up some milk for the kids' cereal in the morning,” she said, as she hastily grabbed some paper towels to dry her hands, her eyes fixed on her watch as she rushed out of the restroom."
"“I need you there,” I clarify. “And I need you to look like you’re comfortable with me, comfortable","being married to me.

Fabric design?”","course. I'm just being paranoid. It's just a normal day, after all. But then she sees it. A black car, parked",33,"course. I'm just being paranoid.

She tries to brush it off as mere coincidence, but the feeling persists. Suddenly, the car's door opens, and a man in a black suit steps out, his eyes fixed intently on Anna. Her breath catches in her throat as he begins to walk towards her, his pace slow and deliberate."
"Once, when we were roommates, Anna flew to Seattle with a friend. It had been her first time on an airplane, and she struggled so much navigating the travel website that she brought me her laptop at midnight and asked for help. I finished the transaction for her, prebooked the car","to the airport, and then quietly tracked the ride the day she left to make sure she got there okay. When she got home, she made a point of thanking me for the help. Apparently, the trip itself was fine, but the highlight for her had been flying on an airplane.","service, and even printed out the boarding passes.

As time went on, Anna became more confident in her travels, and soon she was jetting off to new destinations without any assistance. I was happy to see her grow and explore the world, and I was always eager to hear about her adventures when she returned. Despite our differences, we had formed a strong bond, and I was grateful to have her in my life."
"“That person deserves jail time.” She brings the glass to her lips, taking a tiny","sip. “Mmmmm.” Anna turns to meet my eyes. “And by the way, it’s anything over ninety-nine.”","sip of the amber liquid, her eyes never leaving mine as she swallows, the sound of the glass",31,"sip of the amber liquid, her eyes never leaving mine as she swallows, the sound of the glass being set back down on the table echoing through the tense silence that has fallen between us.

I can feel the weight of her words, the unspoken challenge hanging in the air like a gauntlet thrown down, waiting for me to pick it up and respond."
Anna’s smiling at me like I amuse her. “I meant more as,"in, is she nice? Does she have hobbies or a favorite band?”",in the sense that you're the only one who's been able to make,24,"in the sense that you're the only one who's been able to make me feel like I'm home, like I'm exactly where I'm meant to be, and that's a really scary thought for me, because I've never felt that way before, not even with my own family."

I feel her looking at me for a quiet beat. “I think you’re joking. I’m,not sure.” Anna downs the rest of her prosecco. “A hint of danger. I like it.”,"not going to fall for that, am I?” she says, her voice laced with a mix of amusement",31,"not going to fall for that, am I?” she says, her voice laced with a mix of amusement and skepticism, as she raises an eyebrow, clearly waiting for my response."

As they walk to the door, she can't help but notice the way the sunlight catches the lines on his face, making him look older than his years. She feels a surge of affection for him, and reaches out to give his hand a squeeze. ""You'll be okay,"" she says, smiling up at him. ""Just take it easy, okay?"""

"I walk back inside, realizing I’d been so focused on the sleeping situation, I haven’t properly flailed over the sheer bliss that is our bungalow. In fact, I’m pretty sure the only thing in here I could afford is the roll of eco-friendly toilet paper I can clearly see from where I stand. And even that looks pretty fancy.

But as time went on, I began to see the cracks in the facade, the subtle hints that something was not quite right. And then, one day, everything came crashing down, and I was left to pick up the pieces of a life that had been built on lies and deception."
"“What does that mean?” I ask. If Alex knew enough, he wouldn’t try",to take West down? Is this about the mysterious loophole in the trust?,to explain it to me. He would just tell me what I needed to know and leave,26,"to explain it to me. He would just tell me what I needed to know and leave it at that.

West sits on the bench and pulls a shoe off. I set my clutch down on a shelf in the open closet. “I’m thinking Alex will take a keen,"interest in exactly how happy we seem.” I narrow my eyes, staring into the distance. “West… this assignment is no longer just ‘show up and wear a wedding ring.’ ”","interest in the new project, don't you think?""

I ask, turning to face him as I slip my heels off and set them beside my clutch. West looks up at me, his eyes squinting slightly as he works the knot on his other shoe loose. ""Yeah, I do,"" he says, his voice low and thoughtful. ""He's been looking for a challenge, and this could be just the thing."" He pulls his shoe off and sets it beside the first one, then stands up, his eyes locked on mine as he moves closer. ""But I'm more interested in what you think,"" he says, his voice dropping to a low murmur. ""You're the one who's been pushing for this, after all."" He stops in front of me, his eyes searching mine, and I can feel the weight of his gaze like a physical touch. I take a deep breath, trying to calm the flutter in my chest as I meet his eyes. ""I think it's a great opportunity,"" I say, trying to sound calm and professional. ""But I also think it's a big risk. We'll need to be careful, make sure we're prepared for anything that might come up."" West nods, his eyes never leaving mine, and I can see the wheels turning in his head as he considers my words. ""I agree,"" he says finally, his voice firm. ""We'll need to be careful, but I think it's a risk worth taking."" He pauses, his eyes locked on mine, and I can feel the tension between us building. ""I'm glad you're on board with this, Emily,"" he says, his voice low and husky. ""I don't know what I'd do without you."" His words send a shiver down my spine, and I feel my heart skip a beat as I meet his eyes. I know I should look away, but I'm frozen, trapped in the depths of his gaze. And then, without thinking, I reach out and touch his arm, my fingers brushing against his skin. It's a fleeting touch, but it's enough to send a spark of electricity through me, and I know in that moment, I'm in trouble."

Despite what she’d told me about sleeping in one place all night, at some point she’d migrated across the massive bed to throw a","leg over my hip, send an arm over my torso, and press her face to my neck.

I thought about our conversation, and the way she'd looked at me with such intensity. I wondered what she was thinking, and whether she was feeling the same connection that I was. As I lay there, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. What did the future hold for us? And what did Anna really want from me?"

"“JESUS CHRIST,” I BLURT, the second I turn at the corner of our bridge and step onto the deck of our bungalow. Anna is curled up in","a papasan, with a sketch pad in her seemingly bare lap.

""It's just...I don't know if I can do this anymore,"" she says, her voice barely above a whisper. I feel a pang of fear, not knowing what she's talking about, but knowing it can't be good. I take a step closer to her, my heart racing with anticipation. ""Do what?"" I ask, trying to keep my voice calm. She looks away from me, and I can see the tears welling up in her eyes again. ""This,"" she says, waving her hand vaguely. ""Us. Our life here. I just feel so trapped and alone."" I feel like I've been punched in the gut. I had no idea she was feeling this way. I thought everything was fine, that we were happy. I take another step closer to her, and she looks up at me again. ""We can fix this,"" I say, trying to sound confident. ""We can make it work."" But as I look into her eyes, I'm not so sure."

I sigh.
