"It may be the first time I’m meeting the people gathered around the table, people who Ryan has known since childhood, but it hasn’t escaped anyone’s attention that I’m already fully embedded in his life. It’s the small touches","a woman brings to a man’s home, like the matching throw pillows on the couch or the faint whiff of jasmine from the diffuser on the bookshelf, that every other woman notices the second she walks through the front door.","that speak volumes – the way he reaches for my hand when we're walking, the way he knows exactly how I take my coffee, the way he can finish my sentences.

It's a level of comfort and familiarity that I've never experienced before, and it's both exhilarating and terrifying. As we sit around the table, passing plates of food and sharing stories, I can feel the weight of their curious gazes on me. They're sizing me up, trying to figure out how I've managed to burrow so deeply into Ryan's life in such a short amount of time. I can sense a mix of emotions emanating from them - some are warm and welcoming, while others are more reserved, even skeptical. I don't blame them, really. I'm still trying to wrap my own head around the speed and intensity of our relationship. But as I glance over at Ryan, who's laughing and chatting with his friends and family as if he doesn't have a care in the world, I know that I'm exactly where I'm meant to be."
The smile on Ryan’s face tells me he knows how I feel about being asked,"this and he’ll step in again to answer for me, but I shake him off.","to join the company's annual retreat, a tradition I've managed to avoid",30,"to join the company's annual retreat, a tradition I've managed to avoid for the past three years, and one that fills me with a sense of dread and anxiety every time it's mentioned."
"Ryan would have given them more than they deserve, and that’s why I stopped him. I don’t mention it was at the truck stop on the outskirts of town where I worked in the","small restaurant bar making sure no drink went empty. And I don’t mention that while they are familiar with lots of acronyms from MBA to MRS, the only one I’m acquainted with is GED.","summer of '95, pumping gas and fixing flats for the long haul truckers.

It was a hot summer, the kind that makes the asphalt shimmer like water on the highway, and the only shade to be found was under the awning of the truck stop's mini-mart. I was 19, and Ryan was 20, and we thought we knew it all, but looking back, we were just a couple of dumb kids trying to make a name for ourselves in a town that didn't want us. I remember the night like it was yesterday, the neon lights of the truck stop reflecting off the wet pavement, and the sound of the crickets providing the only soundtrack we needed. Ryan had just gotten back from a stint in the city, and he was full of big ideas and even bigger talk. He had a plan to make some real money, and he was convinced that I was the only one who could help him pull it off. I was skeptical at first, but Ryan had a way of making you believe in him, even when you knew you shouldn't. So I agreed to meet him at the truck stop, and that's when I saw them, a couple of rough looking guys, the kind that you didn't want to mess with. Ryan was already talking to them, his voice low and smooth, like he was trying to sell them something. I knew right then that I had to put a stop to it, before things got out of hand."
"I told Ryan I was afraid of how they would judge me once they found out my background was so different from theirs. He assured me he didn’t care what they thought, but he does. The fact that he caved","and invited them all here and spent the week helping me get the menu just right tells me more than the whispers in the dark that he likes how different I am, different from the girls he grew up with.","in to their pressure and told me to keep my past a secret from them proves that he does care.

I know he was trying to protect me, but it still hurts that he didn't stand up for me and my truth. I feel like I'm living a lie, and it's eating away at me. I wish he could understand that my past is a part of who I am, and that I'm not ashamed of it. I'm proud of how far I've come, and I wish he could be proud of me too."
I watch Ryan. I’ve whittled down our entire meeting to one,"sentence, and so far, he’s let me get away with it.","moment, a single, fleeting instant that will determine",22,"moment, a single, fleeting instant that will determine the course of our future together. His eyes, a deep shade of blue that seems to hold a world of emotion, lock onto mine, and I feel the weight of his gaze like a physical touch. The air is heavy with tension as we both wait for the other to make the first move, to break the silence that has stretched out between us like a challenge. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest, the sound of my own breathing the only noise in a room that seems to have been stripped of all sound. And then, in a movement so slight it's almost imperceptible, Ryan's eyes flicker, a tiny crack in the mask he's been wearing, a glimmer of something more beneath the surface. It's enough to give me hope, to make me think that maybe, just maybe, we can find our way back to each other."
"I smile and laugh, not too loud and not too long, to show that I,","too, am amused at the thought that Ryan would go to such extremes to meet me.","am still a part of the group, but also to avoid drawing too much attention to",31,"am still a part of the group, but also to avoid drawing too much attention to myself, as I've learned that in this new environment, it's better to blend in and observe before making any bold moves."
"“I totally nailed it,” I say, as I dip the last dinner plate into the sink full of soapy water. Ryan moves in behind me, his arms skimming my hips","until they are wrapped around my waist. His chin settles on my shoulder, and his lips press against that spot on my neck in a way he knows I adore.","as he reaches for the dish towel hanging from the oven door handle.

I feel a flutter in my chest, a familiar spark that I've grown to associate with his touch. It's been three years since we moved in together, and yet, the way he wraps his arms around me still makes me feel like I'm home. ""You did nail it,"" he says, his breath whispering against my ear, sending shivers down my spine. ""Dinner was amazing."" I smile, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over me. It's moments like these that I cherish, the quiet, everyday moments that make our life together feel so rich and full. I turn to face him, and our eyes meet, the connection between us palpable. ""Thanks,"" I say, my voice barely above a whisper. ""I was hoping you'd like it."" Ryan's eyes crinkle at the corners as he smiles, and he leans in, his lips brushing against mine in a soft, gentle kiss. It's a kiss that speaks volumes, a kiss that says, ""I'm here, I'm yours, and I'm not going anywhere."" And in that moment, everything feels right with the world."
"Ever since Ryan asked me to move in with him five days ago and I said yes, he’s been impatient for it to happen. I woke up","the morning after the dinner party to him on the phone with a moving company, scheduling their services for later that day, thanks to a last-minute cancellation.","this morning to the sound of his key in the door, and I knew he was there to start moving my things to his place.

I got out of bed and began to get dressed, trying to shake off the lingering sleep. As I made my way to the kitchen, I could hear the sound of boxes being moved around and the murmur of Ryan's voice as he talked to himself. I poured myself a cup of coffee and sat down at the table, watching as Ryan efficiently packed up the last of my belongings. He was so focused, so intent on getting everything done as quickly as possible, and I couldn't help but feel a little overwhelmed by his enthusiasm. I took a sip of my coffee, feeling the warmth spread through my chest, and tried to match Ryan's energy, but it was hard to shake the feeling of uncertainty that had been growing inside me since I'd agreed to move in with him. What if this was a mistake? What if we weren't as compatible as I thought? I pushed the thoughts aside, telling myself I was just nervous, that it was normal to feel this way. But as I looked over at Ryan, who was now lugging a large box out the door, I couldn't help but wonder what the future held for us."
"Ryan looks down at the tie, straightening it even though it’s already straight but needing something","to do. He hasn’t touched me this morning and barely looked at me. Yep, total baby.","to do with his hands, a nervous habit he's had since he was a kid, and one that he",32,"to do with his hands, a nervous habit he's had since he was a kid, and one that he thought he'd long outgrown, but apparently not, not when it came to this, to standing in front of her, looking like a complete idiot, and trying to play it cool."
"Twenty minutes after Ryan’s Tahoe pulls out of the driveway, I’m doing the same in my ten-year-old 4Runner. Lake Forbing is a medium-size town in north Louisiana that is known for its fertile farmlands and deep pockets of natural gas. There","is a lot of money in this area, but it’s the quiet kind. It takes fifteen minutes to get to Lake View Apartments from Ryan’s house, and from what I can tell it’s nowhere near the lake this town was named after.","are only a few paved roads in the parish, and most of the residents make their living off the land, either by farming or working in the oil fields.

I've lived in Lake Forbing my entire life, and I know these roads like the back of my hand. I take a deep breath, feeling a mix of emotions as I head out to meet Ryan. We've been friends since childhood, and I've always considered him to be more like a brother than just a friend. But over the past year, things have been strained between us. His dad, the sheriff, has been riding him hard about taking over the family business, and Ryan's been feeling trapped. I've tried to be supportive, but it's hard when you feel like you're losing your best friend to the pressures of small-town life. I push the thoughts aside and focus on the road ahead, the familiar sights of the parish rolling by as I make my way to our meeting spot."
Pat follows me up the stairs while his helper opens the back of the large box truck.,"Stopping in front of the door, I pull a key out of my bag. “This is me.”","As we reach the top, I can see that the truck is filled to the brim with",34,"As we reach the top, I can see that the truck is filled to the brim with all sorts of items, from furniture to boxes of various sizes, all neatly packed and secured to prevent any damage during transport. Pat's helper begins to unload the items, carefully carrying them down the stairs and into the house, while Pat supervises the operation, ensuring that everything is placed in its designated spot. I watch in amazement as the truck is slowly emptied, and our new home begins to take shape."
"I eye the first stack of boxes, each filled with the items I’ve spent the last four days picking out.

The memories attached to each item are still so raw, so tender, that I've been avoiding this task for far too long. But now, with the move looming and the need to downsize, I've finally mustered the courage to tackle it. I take a deep breath, and begin to open the first box, the flaps creaking as I lift the lid. A faint scent of old books and dust wafts out, transporting me back to a time when life was simpler, less complicated. I gently lift out the first item, a small, leather-bound book, its cover worn and faded. As I open it, a piece of paper slips out, carrying a message scrawled in Pat's familiar handwriting. My heart skips a beat as I read the words, a mix of sadness and nostalgia washing over me."
"In the kitchen area, I unzip the black bag and remove four menus from nearby restaurants and three pictures I printed from the kiosk at CVS of Ryan and me, plus seven magnets to hold each item in place on the refrigerator. Next, I grab the assortment of condiments and pour half of each one down the sink drain before lining them in the door of the refrigerator. Moving to the bathroom, black bag in tow, I pull out the shampoo and conditioner then pour half of each down the drain like I did with the condiments, before putting the bottles on the edge of","the tub. Unwrapping a bar of Lever 2000 soap, I set it on top of the drain in the sink and turn the water on, rotating it every few minutes until the logo is gone and the edges are dulled, then drop it into the small built-in space on the shower wall. Toothpaste is last. Starting from the bottom, I squeeze a portion out but leave a glob or two on the rim of the sink, just like I do at Ryan’s house, even though I know he’ll fuss about it.

"I slide my hands into my front pockets and lean back against the wall next to the kitchen counter, crossing one ankle in front of the other. My movements are slow but calculated. It worries me she’s here, checking on me, and that she’ll feel the same","need to do so on Saturday, when Ryan is here moving me out.

I hope she doesn't see the fear that's still lurking in my eyes."

"She clucks her tongue against the roof of her mouth, then turns to leave. It takes everything in me not to throw the bolt closed","behind her.

"From the way Ryan tells it, one day he dropped by to check on his grandfather, only to find he had died peacefully in his sleep, and then a week later Ryan was moving in.","The only possessions he brought with him were his clothes, toiletries, and a new mattress for the bedroom. Ryan probably would have made room for an ugly second-hand couch . . . if I had one.","His grandfather's passing had been a shock to everyone, but Ryan felt a sense of relief wash over him as he began to sort through the old man's belongings.

He had always been close to his grandfather, and the thought of living in the same house where they had shared so many memories was a comforting one. As he started to unpack his boxes and settle into his new life, Ryan couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He remembered the countless afternoons he had spent sitting on the porch with his grandfather, listening to stories of the old days and learning the secrets of the family's history. The old man had been a wealth of knowledge, and Ryan felt grateful to have had the opportunity to learn from him. Now, as he looked around the familiar rooms, Ryan felt a sense of responsibility to carry on his grandfather's legacy. He knew it wouldn't be easy, but he was determined to make the old man proud."

For a moment, they lock eyes, and the world around them seems to fade away, leaving only the two of them, suspended in a sea of uncertainty."
Ryan laughs. “It’s been a while since I’ve had one of your Old Fashioneds.

He doesn't respond, just keeps walking until he's right in front of me, his eyes blazing with anger. I can feel the heat emanating from his body, and I know I need to defuse the situation before things escalate further."
"The lock gives a bit easier this time, and the second the door swings open Ryan has us inside and the door shut behind us. He paces the apartment with","his hands on his hips.

"There is no mention that his mother collects perfume bottles as well, or the fact that I have something in common with her, and I won’t analyze how it makes me feel that he doesn’t let me know this is something we share.

I ask, trying to sound nonchalant. ""Just showing you some old family photos,"" he replies, his voice casual, but his eyes betraying a hint of nervousness.

He then walks back into the living room, where I am still sitting on the couch, and plops down beside me, letting out a contented sigh."
I’m late for lunch with the girls. Sara and I texted back and forth over the course of the last few days trying to find a day that,"worked for everyone, and while adding me to their group message would have saved a lot of time, it will take more than one dinner party for that invitation.","worked for both of us, and today was the only day we could both make it.

He tossed her name around but ultimately","decided to exclude her because, as he put it, sometimes she can get on his “ever last fucking nerve.” Plus, she’s single and that threw off the numbers at the table.","decided against it, and I didn't push the issue, figuring it was his house and his guest list.

Now, as we stood there, I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets he might have been keeping from me, and whether this was just the tip of the iceberg. I glanced over at Ryan, who was oblivious to the tension, chatting away with our other friends. I felt a pang of unease, wondering what other surprises the night might hold."
"Just as I’m stashing my purse on the floor by my chair, I feel",the vibration of an incoming text. A quick glance tells me it’s from Ryan:,"a sudden jolt of electricity run through my body, as if the purse had come",28,"a sudden jolt of electricity run through my body, as if the purse had come into contact with a live wire, and I'm frozen in shock, my heart racing with anticipation, wondering what on earth just happened."

The air is thick with the weight of creativity, and Ryan can't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him as he remembers the countless hours he spent in this very room, lost in his own world of color and imagination."
"“But you shouldn’t have to handle that.” His hand reaches for mine, then he’s pulling me into his lap. I glance at the open door, hoping no one","catches us like this. I’ve only had this job a couple of weeks, and everyone knows I only got it as a favor to Ryan and nothing more.","walks by and sees me sitting on his lap.

The sound of his heartbeat is soothing, and I feel my own heart rate slow down, matching the rhythm of his. In this quiet, intimate moment, all my worries and fears seem to fade away, and I'm left with a sense of peace and tranquility that I've never known before."

For a moment, I let myself believe that everything will be okay, that Ryan's strength and protection will be enough to keep the darkness at bay."
The muffled sound of his phone vibrating has him checking his watch to see who’s calling. Ryan groans as he stands up from his chair,"and digs his device out of his back pocket. “Give me a second,” he says as he steps into the hall to answer the call.","and stretches his arms over his head, giving a good yawn to signal the end of his focused work session.

“Anything else come up?” he asks. His shoulders stiffen while he listens to whoever is on the other line. I’m prepared for the glance Ryan gives me over his shoulder and all he sees is my attention firmly on the seating chart in front of me. Then,"he takes one step farther away from me. The pitch of his voice drops lower. I can’t make out the words, but he’s clearly unhappy and letting it be known. He’s all but growling into the phone. This is not a side of him I have seen before.","he turns back to the phone, his voice low and serious. I can tell by the way his eyes narrow that it's not good news.

He's always been good at keeping his emotions in check, but I've gotten pretty good at reading him over the years. I can tell he's trying to keep his cool, but there's a hint of tension in his shoulders, a slight clenching of his jaw. I feel a flutter in my chest, a sense of unease that I try to shake off. Whatever it is, I'm sure we'll deal with it together. We always do."
“About the same.” Ryan gives me one last kiss then gets up.

I take a deep breath, trying to calm my racing heart, but it's no use. I'm already hooked. I want more. I need more. I get up from the couch, my legs feeling like jelly, and make my way to the window. I push aside the curtains and look out, hoping to catch a glimpse of Ryan. But he's already gone, disappeared into the night. I'm left standing there, feeling lost and alone, wondering what just happened, and what's going to happen next."
"She’s picking apart my story, looking for the truth behind my words. And from my research, she’s good at what she does. Something","isn’t sitting right with her, and she’s trying to decide if digging into my background is worth the possibility of losing Ryan’s friendship.","about her unnerves me, makes me wonder if I've underestimated her.

Or maybe it's the way she asks her questions, each one carefully crafted to poke and prod at my defenses. Whatever it is, I can feel my guard dropping, my carefully constructed facade beginning to crumble under her scrutiny."

He takes a deep breath, feeling the tension in his shoulders begin to ease. This is what he needed, he thinks. A place to get away from it all, to clear his head and remember who he is. He puts the SUV in gear and continues down the road, the only sound the crunch of gravel beneath the tires."
"Moving in with Ryan has upped his romance game: simple touches, sweet words and gestures, going out of his way to make sure I’m happy. When he’s not at work, we’re together.

And of course, there's the way he looks at me, like I'm the only person in the world. It's like he's still in awe that I'm his, that we're doing this, that we're building a life together. I have to admit, it's pretty great to be on the receiving end of all this romance. I feel like the luckiest person alive."

The alcohol burns my throat, but I feel a rush of excitement as Ryan grins at me, his eyes sparkling with amusement."
"Before long, she wanders off to deliver more hugs, and Ryan gets into a deep conversation with a local judge about an upcoming election, so I take a moment to look around. This place is beautiful. The winding driveway was long enough that you can’t see the main road or hear any traffic from the house, making it feel like this party is hidden from the rest of the world—just as its name suggests. The red","wooden barn sits on top of a hill and the pasture slopes down in all directions around it like a sea of green lined with white fences.

There's a group of artists huddled in the corner, passionately discussing their latest projects, while a couple sits on a blanket, gazing lovingly into each other's eyes. The atmosphere is alive with creativity and connection, and I feel grateful to be a part of it, if only for this one fleeting evening. As I stand there, taking it all in, I notice a figure standing off to the side, watching me with a curious expression.

“Ryan!” the man says while flinging his arm around Ryan’s neck and pulling him in tight. The two hug it out while I study the woman,"with him.

The woman's gaze flicks to Ryan, then back to me, and she smiles, a small, tentative smile, before responding, ""I'm Sarah, Ryan's sister."" The tension in her body eases slightly as she says it, and I sense a deep affection between the two of them, a bond that goes beyond just siblings. As we stand there, the three of us, I can feel the weight of unspoken words, of secrets and stories that are waiting to be told."

"I head straight for the tiny room at the front of our trailer that is nothing more than a large closet, but it’s like stepping into another world when I pass through the door. Before cancer ravaged her body, Mama spent every day in this room behind her sewing machine and craft table. Mothers came from all over North Carolina to have her make","pageant dresses, prom dresses, and even the occasional wedding dress for their daughters.

I practiced my smile in the mirror, and I worked on my charm, and I did my best to make sure that every person who came into the shop left feeling happy and satisfied. And for the most part, I think I succeeded. But there were still moments, moments when I felt like I was in way over my head, and I wondered how Mama had done it all these years. And then I would look around the shop, at all the familiar sights and smells, and I would feel a sense of calm wash over me. This was my home, and I was going to make sure it kept running smoothly, no matter what."

"Matt rests his elbows on the arm of his chair and kicks his feet up on his desk, the phone forgotten for a moment. “You’d be doing what you’re good at.

I take a deep breath, weighing my options carefully, knowing that whichever path I choose, there's no turning back."
There was even a picture of James and her at the Derby party in the “People and Places” section of,the tiny local newspaper; her hat was looking even more dainty and refined in print than it did in real life.,"the local newspaper, and it was clear that they were more than just friends.

It was a moment that said, ""We are happy, and we don't care who knows it."""
He heads inside and I sit back and stare at the sky. It’s been a few days since I spied on him at the warehouse and the mailbox is still empty. There was,"another sighting of James and that woman last night. According to social media, they were at a local craft brewery listening to a popular local band. They have hit every hot spot in town.","no sign of the package I was expecting, and I'm starting to get anxious.

"Greg opens the door immediately, as if he has been waiting for me to arrive. He’s wearing a gray suit with a darker gray tie,","and his hair looks like it hasn’t changed since he was a young boy.

""Hey, kiddo,"" he says, his voice booming through the foyer. ""Come on in. I've got a meeting with some potential investors in about an hour, but I wanted to touch base with you first."" He leads me into the living room, where a sleek, silver briefcase sits open on the coffee table, spilling out papers and folders. Greg gestures for me to take a seat, and I comply, trying to take in everything at once. The room is immaculately decorated, with not a single item out of place. It's a far cry from the cluttered, chaotic space I'm used to seeing Greg in. He notices my gaze and chuckles. ""I've been trying to clean up my act, kiddo,"" he says, winking at me. ""Got to make a good impression, after all."""
He nods and gestures for me to come inside. He checks his watch for the second time since,"he’s opened the door, then yells toward the wraparound stairs that curve up the foyer wall. “Jenny!

I pull out my phone and dial a number, waiting for an answer. ""Hey, it's me. I need a favor. Can you get me to Austin without anyone knowing?"" I pause, listening to the response. ""Yeah, I owe you one. I'll make it worth your while. Just get me there in one piece."" I hang up the phone and take another bite of my burger, my mind racing with the possibilities."
Sawyer gives me a grin while he grabs my ass with one hand and pushes open the back door with the other. He’s going,"to be a tough one to wrangle. But if there’s one thing I know, it’s how to handle trust fund babies with big egos.","to pull me out of the crowded bar and into the cool night air.

I stumble a little, my heels catching on the uneven pavement, but Sawyers grip on my hip keeps me upright. He spins me around, his eyes gleaming with mischief, and I feel a shiver run down my spine as he leans in close, his breath hot against my ear. ""You look like you could use some fresh air,"" he whispers, his voice low and husky, and I feel a flutter in my chest as I realize he's not just talking about the air."
"Sawyer and I, along with twenty of his closest friends, show up an hour late. I’ve done as much recon on this little group as I can, trying to see if anyone else is using him to","get inside the house, but they have been fried since last night, so I think I’m the only plant. It didn’t hurt being the girl to show up with the edibles to ensure they stayed that way.","get close to me, but so far, I haven't found anything suspicious.

They all seem like genuine friends, people he's known since childhood or met through work. Still, I keep a close eye on them, just in case. As we enter the venue, I can feel the weight of their curious gazes on me. I'm the newcomer, the outsider, and they're all wondering what I'm doing here with Sawyers. I try to blend in, to act like I belong, but it's hard when you're the only one who doesn't know the inside jokes or the history behind every conversation. Sawyers notices my unease and puts a reassuring hand on my back, guiding me through the crowd. We make our way to the bar, where he orders a round of drinks for everyone. As we wait for our drinks to arrive, I take the opportunity to scan the room, to see if I can pick up on anything out of the ordinary. That's when I see her, standing by the window, sipping a glass of wine. She looks out of place, just like me, and for a moment, our eyes meet, and I feel a spark of recognition. Who is she, and what is she doing here?"
"Like clockwork, Amy pushes through the double glass doors of the bar at 5:25 p.m. For the last two weeks, she has stayed home until","around five in the evening, then she commutes a measly two miles to this country club, where she’ll drown herself in vodka martinis until closing.","p.m., but today she has a meeting with a potential new client at 5:30 p.m. and she wants to make a good impression.

As she enters the dimly lit bar, the sounds of clinking glasses and muted conversations envelop her, and she takes a deep breath, mentally preparing herself for the meeting. She scans the room, her eyes adjusting to the soft lighting, and spots a figure sitting in the corner, sipping a drink. She makes her way over, her heels clicking on the polished floor, and clears her throat to announce her presence."
Amy is five foot seven with an athletic build and honey-blond hair that hits right below,"her shoulders. The makeup is light, the jewelry is nonexistent, and she rocks a perpetual resting-bitch face.","her shoulders, often falling in loose waves down her back.

"Amy brings her glass to her lips and takes a deep drink, finishing it off, then waves the empty","glass in the air. “You’ll never, ever, ever find it!” She’s loud enough that several heads turn her way.","glass in the air, signaling to the bartender that she's ready for another round, her eyes never leaving the",38,"glass in the air, signaling to the bartender that she's ready for another round, her eyes never leaving the figure across the room who's been catching her attention all night."
"Opening the driver’s-side door, I catch her before she falls out onto the concrete. I dig through her purse to find her keys, shoving them in my pocket. Grabbing Amy underneath her arms, I drag her from the car and up the driveway. She loses one shoe and then the other. I","almost want to flip off the camera I know is pointed at me, but I resist and keep my body turned away from the street as much as possible. It’s slow and steady until we get to the front door. Blessed silence meets us as I get the door unlocked and open.","don't bother to pick them up, just keep moving forward. We're almost to the front door.

I fumble through her purse again, this time searching for her house keys. My fingers brush against a small bottle of perfume, a pack of gum, and a wallet before finally closing around the cool metal of the keys. I unlock the door and push it open, dragging Amy inside. The sudden change from the cool night air to the warm air of the house makes my skin prickle. I kick the door shut behind us and lean Amy against the wall, holding her upright while I try to catch my breath. Her head lolls to the side, and she starts to slide down the wall, but I catch her and hold her up. ""Amy, can you hear me?"" I ask, shaking her gently. She doesn't respond, just keeps staring blankly ahead. I shake her again, harder this time. ""Amy, snap out of it!"" I yell, starting to get desperate. Still, she doesn't respond. I look around the room, trying to decide what to do next. The room is dimly lit, the only light coming from a small lamp on the coffee table. The TV is on, but the volume is turned down. I see a bottle of wine on the coffee table, and next to it, a small, empty glass. I look back at Amy, and my heart sinks. She's not just drunk, she's passed out. I sigh, feeling a mix of emotions: worry, frustration, and a little bit of anger. I don't know what to do, but I know I have to do something. I look around the room again, this time spotting a couch. I drag Amy over to it and lay her down, trying to make her comfortable. I take a deep breath, trying to think clearly. I need to get her sober, but I don't know how. I look around the room again, this time spotting a phone on the coffee table. I pick it up and dial a number, hoping someone will answer."
Amy relocated to a hotel in downtown Atlanta the day after I searched her house. That was four days ago. I’m,in my car watching her stumble out of a corner bar the way she does when she’s had at least four martinis.,"still trying to process everything that's happened since then. I've been going over the events in my head,",43,"still trying to process everything that's happened since then. I've been going over the events in my head, trying to make sense of it all, but it's like trying to piece together a puzzle with missing pieces. I keep thinking about Amy, wondering where she is and what she's doing. Is she safe? Is she okay? I feel like I'm going crazy not knowing what's going on. I've tried calling her, but her phone goes straight to voicemail. I've even tried contacting her friends and family, but no one seems to know anything. It's like she vanished into thin air. I'm starting to feel like I'm the only one who cares about what's happened to her. I'm determined to find out what's going on, no matter what it takes."
