"By the time I climb the stairs and reach the front door, I’m clammy with sweat, and inside I drop my tote and wrestle out of my cardigan before toeing off my loafers.

But at least I'll know I didn't just sit around and wonder what could've been. And I think that's a pretty good lesson for my kid, too. I mean, I don't want them to grow up and be like, 'Oh, I should've done this, I should've done that.' I want them to be like, 'I did this, and it was awesome, or I did this, and it was a disaster, but at least I tried.' You know? And I think that's what it's all about, just trying and seeing what happens. And if it doesn't work out, so what? It's not the end of the world. You can always try again, or try something new. That's just how life is, you know?"

The air is thick with the smell of expensive perfume and the soft glow of table lamps casts a warm light over the crowded space. We weave through the throng of people, nodding to those who catch our eye, until we reach a small, circular table tucked away in a corner. A tall, slender man with a kind smile and a mischievous glint in his eye looks up from the chair he's occupying and raises an eyebrow as we approach. ""Ah, right on time,"" he says, his voice low and smooth, like the jazz that's still floating through the air. ""I see you've brought some friends."" He nods at Ashleigh and me, his eyes lingering for a moment on the way Ashleigh's dress hugs her curves before moving back to Harvey. ""I trust you're all ready for a night to remember?"""

The tension in the air is palpable, and I can feel the weight of the previous night's events still lingering. I glance over at Harvey, trying to read his expression, but his face is a mask, giving away nothing. I turn my attention to the breakfast spread before us, trying to focus on the mundane task of eating, but my mind keeps wandering back to the mysterious circumstances that have brought us to this point."

I take a deep breath, and head out to join him, feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness about what the night may bring."
"And when I’m done telling him about the fundraiser, I find myself talking about the kids, about the staff, about our desperate need for an updated stock of kid lit,","and by the end of our conversation, Lance has not only pledged ten kite-building sets for prizes but also offered to host a miniature-painting class for us in the fall.",and how the current selection is woefully inadequate for the diverse range of young readers we serve.

I mention the countless hours our volunteers spend scouring thrift stores and garage sales for anything remotely relevant, and the frustration of having to turn away kids who are eager to read but can't find anything that speaks to them. I tell him about the excitement of the kids when we do manage to get some new books in, and how it's not just about the stories themselves, but about the sense of possibility and representation that comes with seeing themselves and their experiences reflected in the pages. I share my own memories of being a kid and finding solace in the words of authors who understood me, and how I want to provide that same sense of comfort and validation to the kids we work with. As I talk, I can see the skepticism in his eyes start to fade, replaced by a glimmer of interest and maybe even a hint of understanding."
"Slow, soft, familiar. A relief of a kiss, and over way, way too soon, though from the way","Petra is gawking at us, you’d think we’d just performed a handstanding sixty-nine in front of God and everyone.","he had been holding on, it was clear he wasn't ready to let go, the desperation in his eyes a stark contrast to",37,"he had been holding on, it was clear he wasn't ready to let go, the desperation in his eyes a stark contrast to the gentle touch of his lips, a fleeting moment of tenderness in the midst of chaos."

He remembered the way the words seemed to leap off the page, the way the characters seemed to whisper secrets in his ear. It was as if the book had become a part of him, a part that he couldn't quite explain or rationalize. And now, as he sat in the dimly lit room, surrounded by the dusty tomes and fading memories, he couldn't help but wonder if his sister had been right all along. Was he just reading too much into it, or was there really something more to the story, something waiting to be uncovered?"
"Every night that week, we cook together—or Miles cooks, while Jules sits on the counter, curating a country playlist and singing along at top volume","into whatever utensil her brother has most recently set down.

"“Like a room,” I say. “In your house. You said Duke never wanted you to, right? And you’re","tired of looking at the same four walls.

I try to remember the face of the person who might have brought it, but it's a blur, a vague outline that refuses to take shape. The dresser, too, is a mystery - is it the same one that was here before, or was it replaced at some point? I run my hand over the surface, feeling for any imperfections, any signs of wear, but it's smooth, unblemished. The bed, of course, is the most familiar thing in the room, the one piece of furniture that I know intimately, every creak and groan of it, every dip and curve. I've spent countless hours lying on it, staring up at the ceiling, trying to make sense of things, trying to remember. But even the bed, comforting as it is, feels different now, feels like a stranger in this strange new world."
