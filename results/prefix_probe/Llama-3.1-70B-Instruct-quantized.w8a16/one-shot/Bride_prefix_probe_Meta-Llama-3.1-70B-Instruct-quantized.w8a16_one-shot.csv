"Not quite the stuff of childhood dreams. Then again, I’m no dreamer. I only ever contemplated marriage once, back in the gloomy days of my childhood. Following a few too-harsh punishments and a","poorly executed assassination attempt, Serena and I concocted plans for a grand escape, which was going to involve pyrotechnics-based diversions, stealing our math tutor’s car, and flipping off our caregivers in the rearview mirror.","few too many nights spent sleeping on the floor, I began to fantasize about a life where I was loved and cherished, where my opinions were valued and my feelings considered.

I imagined a partner who would stand by my side, who would hold my hand through the darkest of times and celebrate with me in the brightest. But that was just a fantasy, a fleeting dream that I quickly pushed aside as I grew older and reality set in. I never thought it would be something I'd actually experience, and yet, here I was, standing in front of a man who was promising me the world, and I couldn't help but wonder if maybe, just maybe, this was my chance at a happily ever after."
"That was fourteen years ago, though, and Serena never married me. In fact, she’s long gone.

I've tried to move on, to find new purpose in my life, but it's hard when the memories of what could have been linger so strongly. I often find myself wondering what would have happened if Serena had stayed, if we had built a life together. Would we have been happy? Would we have had children? The questions swirl in my mind like a never-ending storm, and I'm left to pick up the pieces of a life that never was."
I did try to arrange a meeting. Suggested to my people that they suggest to his people that we could grab lunch the week before the ceremony. Coffee the previous day. A glass of tap water the morning of—anything to avoid a “How do you do?” in front of the officiant. My request,"was escalated to the Vampyre council, and resulted in a phone call from one of the members’ aides.

His people, or rather, his person - a singularly efficient individual who seemed to be the gatekeeper of all things related to him - replied that he was far too busy to indulge in such frivolities. The ceremony, after all, was a mere formality, a necessary evil in the grand tapestry of our union. I was told that he would, of course, make time for the rehearsal, as it was a matter of great importance that we not trip over each other's feet as we exchanged our vows. But as for a casual, get-to-know-you meeting? I'm afraid that was out of the question. And so, I was left to wonder, would our first meeting as husband and wife be in front of a crowd of friends, family, and the aforementioned officiant, with nothing but a hasty ""I do"" to break the ice?"
"One of the agents stops us in front of the double doors that lead into the courtyard. “Councilman Lark, Miss Lark, one minute. They’re not quite ready for you.” We","wait side by side for a handful of uncomfortable moments, then Father turns to me.

The agent's expression is neutral, but there's a flicker of something in his eyes that makes me wonder if he's trying to convey a message. I take a deep breath and try to appear calm, but my heart is racing with anticipation. The doors behind him are old and ornate, with heavy iron hinges and a large knocker in the shape of a lion's head. They look like they haven't been opened in years, and I can feel a strange energy emanating from them, like they're waiting for something to happen. The agent clears his throat and repeats, ""Just one minute, please."" I nod, trying to appear patient, but my mind is racing with possibilities. What's going on behind those doors? And why are they keeping us waiting?"

"The first things I notice are the two walls of windows, which is exactly what Father wants.

The windows are a statement, a declaration of our existence, a reminder that we are still alive, still breathing, still feeling. And as I step further into the room, I notice the way the light dances across the walls, casting shadows that seem to pulse with a life of their own. It's as if the very essence of the sun has been distilled into this space, and I can feel its warmth seeping into my skin, reviving me, rejuvenating me. I look around, taking in the rest of the room, and I see that it's been designed with the same attention to detail, the same passion, the same love. Every piece of furniture, every ornament, every color choice, it all seems to have been carefully curated to create a sense of harmony, of balance, of peace. And in the center of it all, I see Father, standing by the window, his eyes closed, his face tilted upwards, drinking in the light, his expression serene, content. He's found his haven, his sanctuary, his home. And in this moment, I know that I've found mine too."
"“Whose? Yours? Are you going to . . .” I don’t bother finishing the sentence—the sheer thought is ludicrous. It’s not just weddings that have gone out of fashion hundreds of years ago, but the entire idea","of long-term relationships.

I doubt Vampyres were ever particularly romantic, anyway. “Whose?”","of romantic love and commitment that once accompanied them.

"“A few days? She still wouldn’t let the little asshole starve,” I hurried to add, but the officer had already dropped his pen. And even though I went back to the station three times that week, and eventually managed to get a missing person report filed, no one did anything","to find Serena. The hazard, I guess, of being alone in the world: no one to care that she was safe, and healthy, and alive. No one but me, and I didn’t count. I shouldn’t have been surprised, and I wasn’t.

It was as if he was implying that it was no big deal, that she would turn up eventually, that I was overreacting. But I knew better. I knew that something was off, that something was terribly wrong. And I was determined to find out what it was."
"Because no one cared whether I was safe, or healthy, or alive. No one but Serena. The sister of my heart,","if not of my blood.

And I loved her just the same, with a fierce and unwavering loyalty that only grew stronger with each passing day. Together, we had faced countless challenges, overcome unimaginable obstacles, and celebrated countless victories. And through it all, our bond had only grown stronger, a bond that was forged in the fire of adversity, and tempered by the trials of life."
"I had the keys, after all. Because the key to everything is but a line of code. I was able to rifle through her bank statements, IP addresses, cell phone locations. Herald emails, metadata, app usage. Serena was a journalist, one who","wrote about delicate financial stuff, and the most likely option was that she’d gotten embroiled in something fishy while working on a story, but I wasn’t going to exclude other possibilities. So I went through everything, and found . . . nothing.","had a knack for sniffing out the most obscure and well-hidden information.

I found a trail of digital breadcrumbs that led me to a small, encrypted file buried deep within her email archives. The file was labeled ""Echelon"" and was dated several months prior to her disappearance. I managed to crack the encryption, and what I found made my blood run cold. It was a series of cryptic messages and coordinates, detailing a clandestine meeting between Serena and a mysterious source. The location was an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town, and the time was set for the night of her disappearance. I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized that I had stumbled upon something much bigger than I had initially thought. I knew I had to investigate further, to uncover the truth behind Serena's vanishing and the mysterious forces that seemed to be at play."
"And that’s when I did it: I kneeled in front of Serena’s damn fucking cat. He was playing like he always did after dinner, pawing at a crumpled receipt in a corner of the living room, but managed to squeeze a couple of hisses into his busy schedule just for me. “Listen.” I swallowed. Rubbed my","hand on my chest and then even slapped it, trying to dull the ache. “I know you only knew her for a few days, but I really, really . . .” I scrunched my eyes shut.

""I know you're a sophisticated feline with refined tastes, but I need to ask you something. Can you please, please tell me what's going on with Serena? She's been acting so weird lately, and I'm getting really worried."" The cat looked up at me, his eyes narrowing slightly as if considering my request. I held my breath, hoping against hope that he would somehow magically understand me and provide the answers I so desperately needed. And then, in a move that made my heart skip a beat, he stood up, arched his back, and began to walk away, tail twitching ominously. I followed him, my heart pounding in my chest, as he led me on a wild goose chase around the house, darting under furniture and leaping over obstacles with an agility that belied his age. Finally, he stopped in front of Serena's bedroom door, looked up at me, and meowed loudly. I hesitated for a moment, wondering if I should open the door, but something about the cat's insistent meowing told me that I had to. So, taking a deep breath, I turned the handle and pushed the door open, steeling myself for what I might find inside."
"The receipt, which wasn’t a balled-up receipt at all. It was a piece of paper","torn from a journal, or perhaps a notebook, or—no. A planner. Serena’s incredibly outdated planner.",with some scribbled numbers and a few words that seemed to make sense only to the person who had written,30,"with some scribbled numbers and a few words that seemed to make sense only to the person who had written them.

"Or maybe not quite. A distant bell rang, reminding me of a game Serena and I used to play as kids, a primitive substitution cipher we made up to gossip freely in front of our caregivers. We’d named it the butterfly alphabet, and","it mostly consisted of adding b- and f- syllables to normal words. Nothing complicated: even rusty as I was, it took my brain only a few seconds to untangle it. And once I was done, I had something. I had three whole words:","it had been years since I last thought of it, but the memory came flooding back as I stared at the strange message.

I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized that the symbols were more than just random doodles - they were a message, encoded in the very same alphabet Serena and I had created all those years ago. My mind raced as I tried to decipher the code, my heart pounding with excitement and a touch of fear. What could it possibly say? And who could have sent it? I felt like a kid again, sneaking around and trying to uncover a secret that was meant to remain hidden. The butterfly alphabet, once a harmless game, had become something much more sinister. I took a deep breath and began to decode the message, my hands shaking slightly as I worked. The symbols danced before my eyes, but slowly, they began to take shape, forming words and phrases that made my blood run cold. It was a warning, a warning that spoke of danger and betrayal, of secrets and lies. And at the end of the message, a single sentence that made my heart skip a beat: ""They're watching you."""
"I didn’t scream, or cry, or attack that old hag. I was paralyzed, unable to function properly for the rest of the night, and only started processing what had happened when I","got home and told Serena, who was furious on my behalf and demanded a promise from the caregiver on shift: that I would never be forced to attend a similar function again.","woke up the next morning, feeling like I'd been run over by a truck.

I couldn't shake the feeling of violation, of being taken advantage of, and the worst part was that I couldn't even muster up the courage to confront her about it. The whole experience left me feeling lost, confused, and more than a little scared, like I was walking on eggshells, waiting for the other shoe to drop. I knew I needed to talk to someone, but who could I trust? The memory of that night lingered, haunting me like a ghost, refusing to be exorcised, and I knew I had to find a way to deal with it, to process it, before it consumed me whole."

""I...I don't know what you're talking about,"" he stammers, his voice barely above a whisper, but I can hear the faint tremble beneath the surface, a betrayel of his true emotions. I turn back to face him, my eyes narrowing slightly as I study his expression, searching for any sign of deception or hidden truth."
"Alex mulls it. “Yes and no. There are some instincts that take over in that form, more than they otherwise would. The impulse to hunt,","for instance, is very powerful.

Alex pauses, collecting his thoughts before continuing, ""And the way he looked at me, it was as if he could see right through me, like he knew all my secrets."" Alex shudders at the memory, his eyes glazing off into the distance as he relives the encounter."
Serena’s face flashes through my head. She’s rolling her eyes because I’m wearing a galaxy T-shirt I,"got for free when I bought a lava lamp. Who wears this, Misery?

But the sound of shattering glass snaps me back to reality, and I'm reminded that I'm not in my own home, but in a stranger's, with no recollection of how I got here."

I had assumed that he was a well-known, even celebrated, poet, but it seemed that he was, in fact, a relatively obscure figure, at least in the online world. I wondered if this was due to his style, which was not flashy or attention-grabbing, but rather subtle and understated, or if it was simply a result of the fact that he had not sought to promote himself or his work aggressively. Whatever the reason, I was determined to learn more about him and his writing, and so I continued my search, scouring the internet for any mention of his name or his work."

"“What’s the plan?” Serena would ask if she were here, even though the little schemes she hatched never worked out.

For a long time, we just sit there in silence, the only sound being the waves gently lapping at the shore. I find myself getting lost in the rhythm of the waves, and my own thoughts begin to drift away with the tide. It's as if time itself has slowed down, and all that's left is the present moment, suspended in the stillness of the air. I glance over at him, and see that his eyes are still fixed on the horizon, his expression unchanged. I wonder what he's thinking, what's going on in his mind, but I don't ask. I just sit there, and let the silence wash over me, feeling the weight of my own thoughts slowly lifting, like the ebbing tide."

Suddenly, the lights in the coffee shop begin to flicker, and I feel a shiver run down my spine. What's going on? Is this some kind of prank? I look around, but everyone else seems oblivious to the strange occurrences. I'm starting to feel like I'm losing my grip on reality. And then, just as suddenly as it started, everything stops.
