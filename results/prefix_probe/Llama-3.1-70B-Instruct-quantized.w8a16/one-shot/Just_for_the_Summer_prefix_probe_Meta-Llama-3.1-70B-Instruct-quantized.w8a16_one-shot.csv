I [29m] have been friends with Chad [32m] since we were born.

We've been through thick and thin, and I've always considered him to be more like a brother than just a friend. As we grew older, we started to drift apart, pursuing different interests and careers, but we always made it a point to stay in touch. Recently, I've noticed that Chad has been going through a tough time, struggling with anxiety and depression, and I've been trying to be there for him as much as I can. Despite our busy schedules, we still manage to meet up for a weekly basketball game or a round of golf, and I've come to realize that our friendship is something truly special."
"Anyway, forward to five months ago. I dated Hope [28f] for a few weeks. Not a big deal. We decided we weren’t feeling it, no chemistry, so we called it quits. And then lo and behold she hits","it off with Chad. Of course in true Good Luck Charm fashion, this means Chad is her soulmate. Chad is all googly-eyed over her, they’ve met the parents, they’re ring shopping—and they want to move in together. Immediately.","me up on Facebook and we started talking again.

But then she started flirting with me, and I, being the idiot that I am, flirted back. I know, I know, I'm a terrible person. But I just couldn't help myself. And then, out of nowhere, she asks me to meet up with her for coffee. I'm thinking to myself, ""Why not? It's just coffee."" But as soon as I saw her, I knew I was in trouble. She looked even more beautiful than I remembered, and I could tell she was interested. I tried to brush it off, but I couldn't deny the spark that was there. And then, things started to get complicated. She told me that she had been thinking about me nonstop since we broke up, and that she realized she had made a mistake by letting me go. I was taken aback, to say the least. I didn't know what to say, or how to react. Part of me was flattered, but another part of me was screaming ""Danger, danger, danger!"""
"The only problem is that Chad has six more months on our lease but found a perfect new house for him and Hope, and he can’t afford to pay rent on two places at the same",time. So he had to make the difficult decision to screw me over or screw her over—and he picked me. Now I have to find a way to cover his rent until the lease is up.,"time.

We've had a few people come look at the place, but no one's committed to taking it over yet. I'm starting to get a little worried, to be honest. If we can't find someone to take over the lease, Chad's going to be in a tough spot. He can't afford to pay rent on two places, and I don't want to see him get stuck with a big financial burden. I'm hoping something works out soon."
"I’m annoyed, but I decided to try to find a reason to spend more time outside so I don’t have to stare out my window. I’ve always wanted a dog, but Chad would never agree to it. So I went to a rescue and found the ugliest animal there. The one so hideous, nobody else wanted it. This dog’s got an underbite and mange, and he’s missing half an","ear. He’s a little Brussels Griffon, so he’s got that deep frown—he looks like a judgmental gremlin. I adopted him and named him Chad since the dog is now my new best friend. If you’re reading this, you’re dead to me, human Chad. (Not really, I still love the guy.) But I tag him in the captions of every Chad the Dog Instagram post with “Look, a loyal Chad!”","ear. I named him Rocky, and he's been my constant companion ever since. At first, Chad was furious, but eventually, he grew to love Rocky almost as much as I do.

I've met so many amazing people and animals, and it's given me a sense of purpose. I still get annoyed with Chad from time to time, but now I have Rocky to distract me, and I've found ways to channel my frustration into something positive. It's funny how sometimes the things we think we want the most can end up being the things that hold us back, and it takes something unexpected, like a ugly little dog, to set us free."
I tilted my head so my braid fell to one side and held up four fingers. Maddy,"didn’t look happy, but she took the picture with my phone, then handed it back to me.","looked at me with a mixture of confusion and amusement, her eyes crinkling at the corners",34,"looked at me with a mixture of confusion and amusement, her eyes crinkling at the corners as she tried to decipher the meaning behind my gesture.

My best friend was in a Hawaiian shirt and pink cargo shorts. He was a general manager at Trader Joe’s. I missed not having to go to the grocery store now,"that he had moved out. Actually, I missed a lot of things now that Brad had moved out. Like having another human to talk to, even if it was this one.","because he would bring home all the samples and treats for me to try.

Those were the days when life was simple, and my biggest worry was whether the Mandarin Orange Chicken would be restocked on time."

They were starting to do the couples thing for all the trips and birthdays. They were all going up,"to Lutsen in October to go hiking. They asked me if I wanted to go, but I didn’t.

But amidst all the happiness and togetherness, there was a growing sense of unease that something was off, that something was not quite right."
Brad took a swallow of his drink. “Ask that nurse out. Go,"wherever she is. Pitch the idea to her, she might be into it.”","on, I'm serious. You've been stuck in this hospital for weeks,",25,"on, I'm serious. You've been stuck in this hospital for weeks, and you need a break. Besides, she's been flirting with you shamelessly.

You need to start living again, and I'm not just talking about physical therapy. I'm talking about getting back to life, getting back to the things that make you happy. And if that nurse makes you happy, then you owe it to yourself to at least try. So, go ahead, ask her out. What's the worst that could happen? She says no? Big deal. You're not going to die from rejection. But what if she says yes? What if she's the one who helps you heal, who helps you find yourself again? You'll never know if you don't try. So, go on, ask her out. It's time you started living again, my friend."
"“Yeah,” Brad said. “She dates you, you guys break up, and she rides happily into the sunset too. It’s a win-win. Seriously. This is your chance.",If you don’t do something you’re gonna spend the rest of your life sending women on to their forever families and never getting one for you.”,"to get over her and move on with your life.

Brad looked me in the eye. “You will never find someone as long as all the women you date aren’t actually meant for you. You’re not their,soulmate. Their soulmate is the person they meet after you.

"I had actually thought about her. I’d checked once or twice to see if she’d messaged me again. She hadn’t. The last message was me telling her it was nice chatting with her, three days ago.

"For a moment I debated calling from a blocked number. He was nice, but I still didn’t know him. But I figured it",was just as easy to block him later if he got creepy.

When he finally picked up, his voice sounded warm and friendly, and I felt a wave of relief wash over me. ""Hello?"" he said, and I launched into a greeting, trying to sound casual and relaxed. We chatted for a bit, exchanging small talk and getting a feel for each other's tone and pace. It was nice, easy, and I found myself feeling more and more at ease as the conversation went on. But as we talked, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more he wanted to say, something he was holding back. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it was there, lurking just beneath the surface of our polite conversation."

Maddy looked up. Then her eyes dropped to the laptop I was holding and she somehow immediately,"knew what was about to happen. “No.” She shook her head. “No. No, no, no, no, no. NO.”","guessed that I was looking at the same thing she was, and her face turned bright red as",35,"guessed that I was looking at the same thing she was, and her face turned bright red as she quickly looked away, trying to compose herself.

"As we started pulling our bags from the trunk, a brown-haired middle-aged woman came out of",the side of the three-car garage. “Are you Emma?” she said in a thick Mexican accent.,"the house, wiping her hands on a towel, and approached us with a warm, welcoming smile.",32,"the house, wiping her hands on a towel, and approached us with a warm, welcoming smile. She introduced herself as Sarah, the owner of the bed and breakfast, and helped us carry our luggage into the house. As we entered, I couldn't help but notice the cozy atmosphere that filled the air, with the scent of freshly baked cookies wafting from the kitchen. Sarah showed us to our rooms, each one uniquely decorated with a touch of elegance and charm. After we settled in, she invited us to join her in the living room for a warm cup of tea and some conversation."
"Maddy scoffed quietly. “Yeah, I don’t think we’re going to",lose the house. They can probably see it from space.”,"find any aliens out here in the middle of nowhere,” she",20,"find any aliens out here in the middle of nowhere,” she said, her voice barely audible over the sound of the wind rustling through the tall grass that surrounded them, the only response from her brother being a skeptical snort as he continued to scan the horizon with the binoculars, his eyes squinting against the bright sunlight."
Maddy must have been thinking the same thing I was. “Does it rain a,"lot in Minnesota?” she asked, raising her voice over the sound of the old motor.","lot in the summer here?” she asked, her eyes squinting slightly as she gazed out",29,"lot in the summer here?” she asked, her eyes squinting slightly as she gazed out at the lush greenery that surrounded us. I nodded, feeling a sense of relief that I wasn't the only one who had been wondering about the weather. “I was just thinking that,” I said, smiling slightly. “I've never been this far south before, so I wasn't sure what to expect.” Maddy nodded thoughtfully, her expression serious. “It can be a real challenge, especially for people who aren't used to it. But it's also really beautiful, in its own way.”"
We lugged our bags up the stairs and were sweating by the time we made it to the door. We came in through a screened-in porch that overlooked the lake. Maddy and,I shared a glance. It was adorable. White wicker rocking chairs and a small matching loveseat with thick floral cushions. A cute coffee table and plastic ferns in wrought-iron planters and hanging baskets.,"Daddy were already there, sitting in rocking chairs and sipping lemonade.

The house was old and creaky, with a big stone fireplace that dominated one wall of the living room. There were family photos on the mantle, and a big wooden clock that ticked away, making the only sound in the room. We dropped our bags on the floor and collapsed onto the couch, exhausted from the long drive. Maddy got up and gave us each a big hug, and Daddy just nodded at us from his chair, a small smile on his face. We spent the rest of the afternoon just sitting around, catching up on each other's lives and enjoying the peacefulness of the surroundings. As the sun began to set, Maddy suggested we take a walk down to the lake, and we eagerly agreed, feeling the need to stretch our legs and get some fresh air. The walk was short, but the view was breathtaking - the lake sparkled in the fading light, and the trees surrounding it were reflected perfectly in its calm waters. We sat down on the dock, watching the stars begin to twinkle overhead, and just enjoyed the beauty of nature. It was a perfect way to end a long day of traveling."
"The bedrooms were off the living room on either side of a short hallway with a single bathroom shared in the middle. The bathroom had a white claw-foot tub, pale blue","tile, and an old pedestal sink. I took the room with the cushioned reading nook in the window and Maddy picked the one with the hanging swing chair in the corner.","walls, and a pedestal sink with a mirror above it.

The floors creaked beneath your feet, and the windows let in a warm breeze that carried the scent of blooming flowers from the garden outside. The house was old, but it had a cozy, welcoming feel to it, like a warm hug on a cold day. The living room was the heart of the house, with a fireplace that crackled and popped on chilly evenings, and a big window that let in a flood of sunlight during the day. It was a place where you could sit and read a book, or take a nap, or just sit and watch the world go by."
"Four hours later, Maddy and I were back at the cottage sitting in the screened-in porch.",We’d had dinner in town and then boated back. The fridge was stocked up and we’d unpacked.,"The crickets were chirping loudly in the nearby woods, and the scent of honeysuckle wafted",33,"The crickets were chirping loudly in the nearby woods, and the scent of honeysuckle wafted through the air, mingling with the sweet aroma of freshly baked cookies that Maddy had just taken out of the oven."
She looked away from me. “Emma…” Her eyes came back to mine. “Please. Please do it.,Do it now before you lose the chance to meet them altogether. People don’t live forever.”,"don't make me beg.

"“How about this,” Maddy said. “Run your DNA and make your account private. We’ll change your privacy settings for a few minutes, poke around. If you have any","relatives out there, we’ll screenshot it and go back to private. Then I’ll go and find them online and tell you if they seem like people worth knowing.”","hidden accounts or secret messages, we'll find them.

The choice is yours, but you have to decide now."
We prioritized power for the coffee maker first and we brewed a pot while I sat in the kitchen with,"a towel wrapped around my head. When it was done, Maddy poured me a cup and handed it to me.","my eyes fixed on the clock, waiting for the minutes to tick by so that I could call the repairman",40,"my eyes fixed on the clock, waiting for the minutes to tick by so that I could call the repairman and hopefully get the heat back on before the day got any colder. As I sat there, I couldn't help but think about how much I took for granted the simple things in life, like a warm cup of coffee on a chilly morning, and how quickly they could be taken away. The coffee maker, which had been a faithful companion on so many mornings, now sat silently on the counter, its usual gurgle and hiss replaced by an ominous stillness. I got up and poured myself a cup from the pot, the aroma filling the air and momentarily lifting my spirits. But as I took a sip, I couldn't shake the feeling that this small pleasure was only a temporary reprieve from the cold, dark reality that had settled over our little house."
The snail’s-pace speed the pontoon put out somehow seemed faster with the beach approaching. Maddy threw it in reverse. The engine,"downshifted miserably, but we started to slow. Then to my horror we began to move backward, motor first, right into the dock.","roared to life, spewing water in a wide arc as the pontoon lurched backward, narrowly avoiding a collision with the shore.

"When we were safely away from anything we could crash into, Maddy killed the engine and slumped in the captain’s","seat. “If we’d been on the other side of the dock, we could have hit the yacht,” she said, looking shaken.","chair, exhausted.

The silence was a welcome relief after the cacophony of the engine and the sound of crunching metal. I let out a deep breath and looked over at Maddy, who was staring blankly ahead, her eyes fixed on some point in the distance. I followed her gaze, but there was nothing there, just the endless expanse of water stretching out to the horizon. I turned back to her, concern etched on my face. ""Maddy, are you okay?"" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. She didn't respond, didn't even flinch. I reached out and gently shook her shoulder, trying to rouse her from her trance-like state. Slowly, she turned to me, her eyes unfocusing as she took in my worried expression. A small, weak smile played on her lips as she reached out and took my hand in hers. ""I'm fine, kiddo,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ""Just a little...shaken up."" I nodded, trying to reassure her, but I could see the fear lurking in her eyes, the fear that we both knew was still out there, waiting for us."
"I lined the nose of the boat up with the side of the dock and started for it again, only this time I killed the thrust earlier. We",coasted along the side and I put us into reverse to slow us down while Maddy grabbed one of the dock poles and we came to a stop.,"drifted in, and I was able to grab the dock's edge and pull us in.

As we tied up, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over me. The sun was beginning to set, casting a warm orange glow over the water, and I knew we'd made it just in time. My friend, who'd been quiet for most of the ride, finally spoke up, ""Well, that was fun. You're a natural."" I smiled, feeling a sense of pride, and replied, ""Thanks, I've had my fair share of practice."" We both laughed, and I knew that this was a moment I'd always treasure, a moment of peace and tranquility, surrounded by the beauty of nature."
"Her phone rang. “Oh, hold on. I have to leave my ringer on in case Maddy gets in trouble trying to get back.” She looked at it. “It’s her.” She swiped and put the",phone to her ear. “Maddy? Are you okay?” She listened for a second and then glanced at me. “Okay.” Then she hung up. She nodded over her shoulder. “Can we go down there really quick?”,"phone to her ear.

""Okay, sweetie, drive safe,"" she said, trying to reassure her. ""I'll see you soon."" She hung up the phone and turned back to the TV, but she couldn't focus on the show. She kept thinking about Maddy and hoping that she would make it home safely."
I hadn’t really cared too much that Benny might not be here today. He wasn’t the point of this visit. But all that,had changed in the last ten minutes.

You guys can go in when you want.”,"at a door that I hadn't noticed before, which she pushed open to reveal a",27,"at a door that I hadn't noticed before, which she pushed open to reveal a narrow stairway leading down into darkness."

Well I’m glad you made it, I was worried. Okay. Okay. I will.

""Okay, Maddy, I'll be right there,"" she said finally, her voice firm but laced with a hint of resignation. She hung up the phone and turned to face me, a look of apology on her face. ""I'm so sorry, but I have to go. It's my mom. She needs me."" She grabbed her purse and headed for the door, her movements quick and decisive, leaving me to wonder what had just happened and what was waiting for her on the other end of that phone call."
“I hope so. It’s been a little stressful.” She picked up Murder Mittens. “I don’t think I really thought this island thing through. It,"sounded like a good idea at the time but it’s kind of inconvenient. Anyway, it’s only for six weeks and Maddy likes the cottage, so…”","was supposed to be a relaxing vacation, not some kind of bizarre adventure.

What is this thing, anyway? Is it some kind of animal? A monster? I glance over at Murder Mittens, who's still sitting calmly on the rock, looking like the epitome of innocence. I swear, that cat has a sixth sense or something. She always knows when something's up. I pick her up, cradling her in my arms, and begin to pace back and forth along the beach, trying to think of what to do next."
The woman’s eyes moved back and forth over the mouth of her open,Coach bag. Emma took her gently by the elbow. “I’m Emma. What’s your name?”,"purse, as if searching for the words that had been left unspoken, and then,",27,"purse, as if searching for the words that had been left unspoken, and then, with a quiet determination, she reached out and gently closed it, as if to seal in the secrets that lay within."
Maddy was already off the pontoon and running toward me across the beach. She skidded to,"a halt in front of me, still catching her breath from the sprint. “This bitch,” she managed.","a stop in front of me, her eyes wide with excitement, and said, ""I saw it, I saw it, it's huge!""",33,"a stop in front of me, her eyes wide with excitement, and said, ""I saw it, I saw it, it's huge!"" as she tugged on my arm, pulling me toward the water's edge."
"Amber was in a flowing white-and-peach chiffon summer dress with a slit up the thigh. Her long brown hair was down, she had on a floppy wide-brimmed hat and huge sunglasses. She was carrying","a bottle of champagne in one hand and her sandals in the other, dangling off the tips of her fingers. She was beaming, running toward us across the beach, kicking up sand. “Emma!” She laughed.","a large straw tote bag and her feet were clad in a pair of worn-out sandals, giving off a relaxed and effortless vibe as she strolled along the sun-kissed beach, the warm breeze rustling her hair",69,"a large straw tote bag and her feet were clad in a pair of worn-out sandals, giving off a relaxed and effortless vibe as she strolled along the sun-kissed beach, the warm breeze rustling her hair and the sound of the waves gently lapping at the shore creating a soothing melody that seemed to match the rhythm of her footsteps. As she walked, the slit in her dress would occasionally reveal a glimpse of her tanned leg, adding a touch of playfulness to her overall demeanor, and the floppy hat would sometimes slip down over her eyes, forcing her to push it back up, a gesture that seemed almost habitual, yet endearing nonetheless."
"“Emma, you won’t believe my day,” she said, looking back at me. “So I wanted to surprise you. I flew all the way over here on","a red-eye, got an Uber, and came out to the address you gave me, but when I knocked on the door this handsome man answered instead.”","a whim, just to see you and give you this gift in person.

So, here I am, with a silly gift and a big smile, hoping to bring a little bit of joy into your life."
“Are you kidding me with this?” Maddy hissed as soon as they were out,of earshot. “She’s here for what? Six hours? And she’s already hypnotized our landlord?”,"of the restaurant, her voice low and even, but vibrating with suppressed anger as she glared",28,"of the restaurant, her voice low and even, but vibrating with suppressed anger as she glared at her sister, who was still trying to stifle a grin."
Maddy crossed her arms. “What she always does? Show up and leave a path of,"destruction in her wake? She’s not staying with us,” she said in her end-of-discussion voice.","destruction in her wake? I'm not sure I'm ready for that kind of drama in my life right now,""",30,"destruction in her wake?

Maddy wasn't sure she was ready to deal with that kind of fallout again, not when she was still trying to pick up the pieces of her own life."
Maddy rolled her eyes in the way that I knew meant she was aware. “Please tell me I don’t have to stay and watch,you eat crustaceans with that woman. Let’s just go back to the island and you see her tomorrow or something when she’s done with what’s-his-face.”,"this train wreck of a date,” she said, her voice low and even, but with a hint of pleading in her eyes.

I watched him walk to the beach and I let out a long breath. Maddy was right.,"This was bad. Mom never left anywhere on good terms. Not jobs, or apartments, or relationships. Especially relationships.","He had been distant for days, and I knew he needed some time to clear his head.

The sound of the waves and the cries of seagulls filled the air, and I felt a sense of peace wash over me. I knew that Maddy had been right, and that sometimes, the best thing you can do for someone is to let them go."
I felt relieved the instant he said he would stay with me because it let Maddy off the hook. She would walk through hell for,me—and this cookout was her hell. I was glad she didn’t have to be here.

She just smiled and gave me a hug, and then she turned and walked back to the house, leaving Daddy and me to go to the hospital together."
"“Thanks.” I looked back at the lake, at Maddy fading into",the distance on the pontoon. “And thanks for pushing her off.”,"the distance, and felt a pang of sadness.

"“He’ll probably completely forget we even exist,” she mumbled, resting her head on","the cushion. “Amber has a way of making people do that,” she said tiredly.","the back of the couch, her eyes drifting shut as the soft hum of the TV lulled",27,"the back of the couch, her eyes drifting shut as the soft hum of the TV lulled her into a restless sleep, her worries and fears momentarily forgotten in the darkness of her subconscious."

Or maybe it's the way she always seems to be holding something back, like there's more to her than what she's letting on. Whatever it is, it's definitely intriguing."
"When I got back to the cottage an hour later, Maddy was in the screened-in porch, reading. She","wore shorts and flip-flops, and she was drinking a beer. She set down her book when I came in.","looked up from her book and smiled, and I could tell by the way she was smiling that she had been",37,"looked up from her book and smiled, and I could tell by the way she was smiling that she had been crying.

I didn't say anything, just sat there with my head against her shoulder, feeling the warmth of her body and the comfort of her presence. After a while, she spoke again. ""I've been thinking,"" she said. ""I've been thinking a lot about us, and about our life here."" I looked up at her, curious, and she went on. ""I've been thinking that maybe it's time for us to leave this place. To start fresh somewhere else."" I felt a jolt of surprise, and a little bit of fear. Leave the cottage? Leave the only home I had ever known? I didn't know what to say, so I just sat there, waiting for her to go on."

It was never going to happen. I knew this. But Maddy wouldn’t let it go unless,"I tried—and really, I should try. Maddy was right, this whole situation was a ticking time bomb.","she had exhausted every last avenue of possibility, and even then, she would still hold on to the",33,"she had exhausted every last avenue of possibility, and even then, she would still hold on to the hope that somehow, someway, things would magically work out in the end, no matter how improbable it seemed."
"I paused, not sure how much I wanted to share. I decided on all of it.

Emma listened intently, her expression a mixture of shock, concern, and curiosity. As I spoke, I could see the wheels turning in her mind, processing the information and trying to make sense of it all. When I finally finished, she sat in silence for a moment, collecting her thoughts before speaking."
"I studied the woman sitting next to me. Imagine someone who went through what she did, turning out the way she had. Able to give",grace to someone who’d let her down so badly.

It was as if she had been tempered by her experiences, like steel forged in fire, and had emerged stronger and more radiant as a result. I found myself drawn to her, wanting to know more about her story, and to understand the secrets behind her remarkable transformation."
I might kiss her tonight. I almost did the other night at the,"dock, but then Amber showed up. I was looking forward to the do-over.","party, but I didn't want to ruin the moment, and I was also afraid of",26,"party, but I didn't want to ruin the moment, and I was also afraid of how she might react, so I hesitated and the opportunity slipped away, leaving me with a lingering sense of what could have been."
I’d tried to be softer with her the last few days. The energy shift I’d had over Mom after my talk with Emma,"was almost as bad as being mad at her.

But as I looked at Rachel, I could feel my defenses rising up again, like a fortress walling me off from the world. I knew I had to try harder, to be more patient, but it was like my emotions were a runaway train, and I was just along for the ride."

But the thought of her leaving was always there, lurking in the back of my mind, making me feel anxious and unsure of myself. I didn't want to think about it, but it was hard to shake the feeling that our time together was limited, that soon she would be gone and I would be left with nothing but memories. I pushed the thought aside and focused on the present, on the fact that she was still here, and that we still had time together. But the knowledge that our time was limited hung over us like a shadow, a constant reminder that our relationship was temporary, that it would eventually come to an end."
"“Yeah,” I said. “Thank you.

I've tried every used bookstore in town, but no one seems to have a copy."" I leaned in, my voice taking on a conspiratorial tone.

Emma pulled two Ziploc bags from her purse. They had Wheat Thins and celery in them.

He took it with a nod of thanks and began to munch on the crackers and celery, his eyes never leaving the road. Emma did the same, savoring the salty flavor of the Wheat Thins and the crunch of the fresh celery. It was a simple, satisfying snack, one that she had packed for them to eat on the go, as they made their way to their destination. As they drove, the silence between them was comfortable, the only sound the crunch of their snack and the hum of the engine."
"I think I would have been embarrassed if I’d been on a date with anyone else. My mother, sobbing drunk the night before",she left for prison. But I knew Emma didn’t judge.

On the other hand, I was also sitting alone in a quiet hospital room, holding the hand of my grandmother, who was taking her last breaths. It was as if the universe had decided to test my emotions, forcing me to experience the highest of highs and the lowest of lows simultaneously. The irony was not lost on me, and I couldn't help but wonder if this was some kind of cosmic balance, a reminder that life is full of contradictions and that every moment of joy is often accompanied by a moment of sorrow."
"What did I have to offer her? I had nothing but baggage. Emotionally damaged, traumatized children that had been catapulted from one tragedy to the next, and me, barely keeping my head above water.

I took her hand and did my best to make my face straight. People were already stopping to watch.

My mom was expertly flipping pancakes, while my dad was attempting to get the coffee maker to work, and my little sister was sitting at the table, coloring in her favorite book. I slid onto the empty chair beside her, and she looked up at me with a big smile, her eyes sparkling with excitement. ""Morning, sleepyhead!"" she chimed, and I couldn't help but smile back at her, feeling a sense of contentment wash over me.
