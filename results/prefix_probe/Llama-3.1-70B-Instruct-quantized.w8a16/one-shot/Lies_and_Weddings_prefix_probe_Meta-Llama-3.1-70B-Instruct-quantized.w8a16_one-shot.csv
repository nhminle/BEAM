RG: Why am I the last one to find out that Eden isn’t coming to Hawaii? I find it hard to believe,that you wouldn’t want her beside you on your special day. Shall I talk to Mum?

"They approached the altar positioned at the edge of the cliff and gazed out at the dramatic view of the Kona coastline just as the sun was dipping into the ocean.

The words were indistinguishable, but the rhythm was unmistakable, a slow, pulsing beat that seemed to match the pounding of the surf against the rocks below. As he chanted, the air around him began to shimmer and the sky seemed to darken, as if night was falling prematurely. The onlookers watched in rapt attention, their faces upturned and their eyes fixed on the shaman as he summoned the spirits of the land."
"Gopal Das tucked the tight white tee that showed off his sinewy pecs into his camo-green cargo shorts and said, “Close your eyes. Now breathe","in deeply…. Let your first chakra connect with the ground, rooting in the earth, connecting with Gaia, connecting with spirit. Now, what do you feel?”","deeply.

I blinked, feeling a little disoriented, but as my gaze met his, I felt a jolt of electricity run through my body. I saw a man who was both familiar and yet, utterly mysterious. A man who seemed to hold secrets and stories that I was desperate to uncover."

""We need to get her to a hospital, now,"" he said, his voice firm and urgent. ""We can't just leave her here like this."" He looked around the room, taking in the scene, trying to piece together what had happened.

""I didn't mean to cause such a commotion."" Her mother's expression softened as she looked at her daughter, concern etched on her face. ""It's alright, dear. Accidents happen. But perhaps next time, you should be more careful when handling hot liquids."" Arabella nodded, feeling a mix of relief and embarrassment. She knew she had to be more mindful in the future, especially when it came to her love of tea."
*3 Although “cottage” could be rather misleading for the spacious four-bedroom house with a thatched roof,"that was decomposing so perfectly, Thomas was constantly finding DIY influencers taking selfies by the garden gate.","that stood proudly on the outskirts of the village, its name had been passed down through generations, and the locals",33,"that stood proudly on the outskirts of the village, its name had been passed down through generations, and the locals had grown accustomed to the charming anomaly. The thatched roof, a testament to the region's rich history, blended seamlessly into the rolling hills that cradled the village, as if nature itself had intended for the house to be a part of the landscape. Despite its spacious interior, the house exuded a sense of warmth and coziness, with its exposed wooden beams and roaring fireplace that seemed to beckon in the chill of the winter nights. It was a place where time stood still, where the air was sweet with the scent of blooming wildflowers, and where the sound of birdsong filled the air, a true haven from the hustle and bustle of city life."
"*4 Though Arabella was raised speaking the Queen’s English in what was then the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong and spoke with the poshest of accents, whenever she came into contact with other Asians—particularly","family members and service people—her accent would take on the inflections and sentence structuring that were peculiar to upper-crust Hong Kongers.

It was as if the sounds and rhythms of her childhood had been lying dormant, waiting to be reawakened by the familiar cadences of her heritage. This phenomenon was not unique to Arabella, for many of her friends who had also been raised in the colony experienced similar linguistic shifts when interacting with others from their ancestral homelands. It was a testament to the enduring power of culture and the complex, often subconscious, ways in which our identities are shaped by the languages we speak."
"“That’s because I’m the only one around here who eats carbs,” Eden said as she took","a bite of her chocolate croissant, still warm from the oven. “You really ought to try one.”","a big bite of her sandwich, the crunch of the bread and the freshness of the lettuce a welcome",33,"a big bite of her sandwich, the crunch of the bread and the freshness of the lettuce a welcome respite from the usual protein-heavy meals that dominated the cafeteria menu, a small act of defiance in a sea of diet-obsessed peers."
"Suddenly Arabella’s eyes lit up and she seemed to recover slightly. “Yes, she will be good","for OS, won’t she?

"“The older woman said, ‘Excuse me, do you speak English?’ I was used to this question, so I simply nodded. The younger woman said, ‘We see you here every day. You’re so good with the baby. She clearly adores you.’ ‘Thank you,’ I replied. And then","the older woman leaned over and whispered, ‘Whatever they’re paying you, we’ll double it.’ I was so confused, and then it hit me: These women think I’m the nanny!

"Arabella credits her own mother for her confidence to upend centuries of tradition. “My mother grew up in Shanghai, which was the Paris of the East, so for her, Asian Fusion wasn’t a fad, it was a way of life.” Arabella’s barrister father","hailed from one of Hong Kong’s most respected legal families. “People are constantly surprised to learn that I didn’t grow up in a rice paddy.

"The countess never imagined that her modern spin on Marco Polo would spawn her own design and hospitality empire, but after a famously finicky Qatari prince spent the weekend and was wowed by the countess’s hospitality, he commanded her to design a hotel in London “for people who can only bear to stay in palaces when they travel,” promising to book out","the entire place every year for the London Season.

"Eden awoke to the sound of unfamiliar chirps. The chorus of birds outside sounded more spirited than anything she’d heard before, and they had been at it all night. Having arrived very late the previous","evening to a house at the end of a pitch-black road, she had no inkling of what lay outside.

She groggily got out of bed and stumbled to the window, pulling back the curtains to reveal a sky ablaze with hues of pink and orange. The birds, a flock of starlings by the look of it, were perched on the telephone wires, singing their hearts out. Eden rubbed the sleep from her eyes, wondering what had gotten into them. She had never seen them so spirited before, and she couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement herself. She quickly got dressed and rushed outside to join in the chorus, feeling the cool morning air fill her lungs as she breathed in deeply. The birds, seeming to sense her presence, turned to her and sang even louder, as if welcoming her to their little concert. Eden laughed and twirled, feeling carefree and alive, the music of the birds washing away all her worries and concerns. As she danced, she felt a sense of connection to the natural world around her, and a sense of wonder at the beauty of it all. The birds, the sky, the trees, everything seemed to be alive and vibrant, and Eden felt grateful to be a part of it all. As the sun rose higher in the sky, the birds slowly began to disperse, their song fading away into the distance. Eden, still feeling the music in her heart, reluctantly made her way back inside, feeling refreshed and renewed, ready to face whatever the day might bring."

“Why? Are you going to the Wolseley? Look how I’m dressed.” Rufus gestured to his tattered board shorts and bare feet as they cut through a wooded path that led from the beach to a road that to Eden seemed straight out of a dream. Tall coconut,"palms, fragrant hibiscus bushes, and mango trees lined the winding lane of relaxed old bungalows and wooden beach cottages next door to the occasional sprawling mansion. Rufus reached up into one of the low-hanging branches as they walked past and plucked two ripe mangoes. “For breakfast.” He grinned.","trees towered above them, their leaves rustling softly in the breeze, and the sound of the waves gently lapping against the shore created a soothing melody that seemed to lull the world into a peaceful slumber.

Rufus's eyes sparkled with excitement as he quickened his pace, his bare feet padding softly on the dusty path. ""Come on, Eden, we don't want to miss the sunset,"" he called out, his voice barely above a whisper, as if he feared breaking the spell that had been cast over this enchanted place. Eden quickened her pace, her long blonde hair bouncing behind her as she followed Rufus through the winding path, the trees growing closer together here, forming a canopy above them that filtered the sunlight, casting dappled shadows on the ground. The air was thick with the scent of blooming flowers and the sound of birdsong filled the air, creating a sense of magic that was almost palpable. As they walked, the trees began to thin out, and the sound of the waves grew louder, until they emerged from the woods and found themselves standing at the edge of a cliff, the ocean stretching out before them, the sun hovering just above the horizon, casting a golden glow over the water. Rufus turned to Eden, a grin spreading across his face, ""Isn't it beautiful?"" he asked, his eyes shining with excitement. Eden nodded, her eyes fixed on the breathtaking view, a sense of wonder washing over her. ""It's incredible,"" she breathed, her voice barely above a whisper. Rufus nodded, his grin growing wider, ""I told you it was special,"" he said, his eyes never leaving the view. They stood there in silence for a moment, taking in the beauty of the scene before them, the only sound the waves gently lapping against the shore, and the distant call of a bird. Then Rufus turned to Eden, his eyes sparkling with mischief, ""Want to go exploring?"" he asked, his voice low and conspiratorial. Eden's eyes lit up with excitement, ""Yes,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper, and together they set off, ready to uncover the secrets that this enchanted place held."
"“Puako Beach Road is one of the only places left on the entire island that still has these original cottages from the sixties right on the beach,” Rufus","explained. “It’s a real neighborhood, as opposed to some poncy resort. You love hunting down the local hangouts whenever you travel, so I thought you’d prefer it over here.”","explained, his eyes scanning the horizon as if searching for a glimpse of the past.

The sound of the waves, the smell of the saltwater, the trade winds rustling through the palm trees... it's like nowhere else on earth."""
Rufus gestured outside. On one end of the back deck was an outdoor shower nestled between thick tropical bushes and a,wall of stacked volcanic rocks. Rufus pointed to a galvanized steel cistern on the roof. “That tank collects rainwater for the shower.”,"large wooden storage cabinet, its door slightly ajar, as if someone had recently passed through it.

He walked towards the shower, his footsteps quiet on the worn wooden planks, and peered around the corner of the cabinet. A small puddle of water had formed on the deck, and a few droplets of water still clung to the leaves of the nearby bushes. It was clear that someone had recently used the shower, but there was no sign of them now. Rufus's gaze swept the surrounding area, his eyes scanning the trees and the underbrush, but he saw nothing out of the ordinary. He turned back to the shower, his mind working overtime to piece together what might have happened."

They went outside to the wooden deck and sat down on a pair of canvas butterfly chairs.

It was moments like these that she cherished, moments of peace and quiet, away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. And as she sat there, she felt grateful for this little slice of heaven, this tiny corner of the world where she could escape and be herself."

"No you’re not, Eden thought to herself as she sipped on her coffee, taking in the sounds of the waves","pounding onto the lava rocks and the ecstatic screech of birds. “I’ve never heard birds quite like this before,” she said.","crashing against the shore, the cries of seagulls wheeling overhead, and the distant hum of a boat engine.

Eden nodded, grateful for the reprieve, but as they walked away from the spot, she couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched, that unblinking eyes were trained on them, waiting for them to make their next move."

"No sooner had Rufus said this than a now-familiar roar filled the air and Freddy’s fantastical boat pulled up to the dock. As everyone climbed on board, a pair of dark-tinted glass doors automatically opened, revealing a sleek, Zenlike interior cabin where Freddy (CEE/Crossroads/NYU/Pepperdine), dressed in a pale beige cashmere sweater over a white","linen shirt and pleated linen trousers, lounged like a pasha on plush white cashmere cushions.

As they settled into the plush, cream-colored leather seats, Freddy began to explain the purpose of their journey, his voice low and soothing, like a gentle breeze on a summer's day. ""We are headed,"" he said, ""for a place of great beauty, a place where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are blurred, where the imagination knows no bounds."" He paused, surveying his guests with an air of quiet anticipation. ""A place, my friends, that few have ever seen, and even fewer have ever returned from."" The words hung in the air, like a challenge, a promise, and a warning, all at once."

"The dream was always the same. She was six, maybe seven years old.

The dream had been recurring for years, a constant ache in her heart, a longing for a love and a presence that was no longer there. Eden would lie in bed, her eyes wide open, trying to hold on to the feeling of her mother's love, but it would slowly fade away, leaving her with nothing but tears and a deep sadness that seemed to have no end."

""It's a reminder, kiddo,"" he said, his voice low and gentle, ""of just how much beauty and wonder there is still to explore in this world."""

"“Sure looks like it,” Eden said as one of the floppy-haired waiters skated up and placed a tall fluted glass filled with a frothy dark liquid","in front of her.

I thought she was going to faint or something. Rufus, of course, was completely oblivious to the commotion he had caused. He just kept on talking, telling us all about how he and Hester had met in the jungle and fallen deeply in love. I have to admit, it was a bit of a shock to me too, but I tried to be supportive, for Hester's sake. But Mummy, she just couldn't handle it.

"“Ah, you’ve been here before, then,” the docent said, looking pleased that this lady knew about the remarkable feature of the Picture Room. Sir John Soane, the architect and collector who had built this house for himself in 1808, designed special “picture planes”—ingenious wall panels","that moved and flipped open—allowing him to double his hanging space and fill the small thirteen-by-twelve-foot room with over a hundred of his favorite paintings.
