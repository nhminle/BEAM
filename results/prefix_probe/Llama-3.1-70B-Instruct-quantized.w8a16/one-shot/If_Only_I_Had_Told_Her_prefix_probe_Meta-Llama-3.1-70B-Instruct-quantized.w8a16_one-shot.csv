I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that,"we were crashing at my house, and I felt it was my duty to be the one to take the blows.","he was trying to get a rise out of her, and I wasn't about to let that happen. I've seen",41,"he was trying to get a rise out of her, and I wasn't about to let that happen. I've seen the way he looks at her, like she's some kind of prize to be won, and it makes my skin crawl. Autumn deserves better than that, and I'll do whatever it takes to protect her from guys like Jack."
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.","Autumn's boyfriend, Alex—started teasing her about being such a scaredy-cat. They joked that she was so jumpy that a little spider would",49,"Autumn's boyfriend, Alex—started teasing her about being such a scaredy-cat. They joked that she was so jumpy that a little spider would be enough to make her shriek. Autumn, of course, insisted that the movie was just really well-made and that anyone would have screamed at those parts. But Jack and Alex just laughed and continued to poke fun at her. That was when Alex had an idea. He suggested that they have a little competition to see who could stay in a haunted house the longest. Autumn, still feeling a bit defensive about her reaction to the movie, agreed to participate, and Jack, never one to back down from a challenge, also agreed. And so, the three of them made a plan to explore the long-abandoned house on the outskirts of town that was rumored to be haunted by the ghost of its former owner, a mean and bitter old man who had died under mysterious circumstances."
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.","My mind, however, is a different story altogether, as it begins to wander back to the events",36,"My mind, however, is a different story altogether, as it begins to wander back to the events that led us to this moment, the tension between us palpable even with my eyes shut tight."
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,"to stir, his eyes fluttering open as he takes in the scene before him.

Then, as realization sets in, his gaze snaps to mine, and I can see the questions forming on his lips. I hold up a hand, forestalling him, and he subsides, his eyes never leaving mine as he struggles to piece together what's happening. I take a deep breath, trying to gather my thoughts, to find the right words to explain the situation to him. But before I can say anything, he's already sitting up, his movements stiff and jerky, his eyes fixed intently on the tent, on her. ""What's going on?"" he asks, his voice low and rough, his words tumbling out in a rush. ""What's happening to her?"""
"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with","the word “type.” Autumn makes a noise in the tent, and we both hold our breaths and listen.","e words ""I'm sorry."" He looks up at me, his eyes red-rimmed and puffy. I can tell he's been",35,"the words ""I'm sorry."" He looks up at me, his eyes red-rimmed and puffy.

I don't know what's going on or what's wrong, but I know I want to be there for him."
"“Zoned out the way she does? You have been so, so…","Like last week!” Jack asks, “How could you have missed that game?”","preoccupied lately, I've hardly seen you notice anything going on around",23,"preoccupied lately, I've hardly seen you notice anything going on around you, let alone take an interest in it,"" he said, his voice low and even, but with a hint of concern creeping in around the edges."

I open my mouth.","smile that always makes my heart skip a beat, I feel a flutter in",29,"smile that always makes my heart skip a beat, I feel a flutter in my chest and I know I'm in trouble. He leans in close, his breath whispering against my ear, and I can feel the warmth of his skin radiating towards me. ""Thanks for walking me out,"" he says, his voice low and husky, sending shivers down my spine. I nod, trying to play it cool, but my heart is racing like a jackrabbit on a pogo stick. He opens the car door and slides in, his eyes never leaving mine, and I feel like I'm drowning in their depths. ""Hey,"" he says, his voice a little louder now, ""you wanna grab some coffee with me tomorrow?"" And just like that, my world is turned upside down."
"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke. Surely the school administrators knew we had always been together, were meant to be together. Surely, if I looked around the cafeteria, she would be there?","together was a different story. We had to sit at the same table, and I was nervous about it, but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Jack was sitting across from us, and he immediately",61,"together was a different story. We had to sit at the same table, and I was nervous about it, but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Jack was sitting across from us, and he immediately clicked with Autumn. They started talking about their shared love of video games, and I was happy to see her so carefree. I, on the other hand, was stuck in a conversation with a boy named Alex, who seemed to only be interested in talking about himself. I tried to be polite, but my mind kept wandering back to the conversation Autumn and Jack were having. They were laughing and joking around, and I couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy. Why was it so easy for them to connect, while I was stuck in this awkward conversation? As the lunch period came to a close, I was relieved to be able to escape Alex's monologue, and I joined in on the conversation with Autumn and Jack. We talked about everything from our favorite TV shows to our families, and I was surprised by how much we had in common. As we were walking out of the cafeteria, Jack turned to me and said, ""Hey, you're not as boring as I thought you'd be."" I laughed and replied, ""Thanks, I think."" And just like that, the three of us formed an unlikely friendship."
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time. I didn’t sit down because I recognized Jack though; I simply sat at the first empty seat, defeated. But Jack remembered me. He asked me if I ever watched pro soccer. I said yeah, not really interested in conversation, not really listening, wondering what Autumn was doing.","the signal to do whatever we wanted. I had been looking forward to talking to him all day, but I didn't know where to start. Jack, on the other hand, seemed to know exactly what he wanted to say.

He turned to me with a serious expression, his eyes locked on mine. ""Hey, can I ask you something?"" he said, his voice low and sincere. I nodded, my heart beating a little faster in anticipation. ""What's up?"" I asked, trying to sound casual despite the butterflies in my stomach. Jack hesitated for a moment, then took a deep breath. ""I was wondering if you'd like to study together sometime,"" he said, his words tumbling out in a rush. ""I mean, we could meet up at the library or something and work on our math homework together."" I felt a surge of excitement at the suggestion, but I tried to play it cool. ""Yeah, that sounds like it could be fun,"" I said, trying to sound nonchalant. Jack grinned, looking relieved. ""Awesome,"" he said. ""I'll give you my number and we can set something up."" As we exchanged numbers, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and possibility. Who knew what might happen when we got together to study?"
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.","Autumn's smile faltered for a moment, and she looked at me with a hint of surprise, as if to say, ""You didn't tell him, did you?""

But then her expression smoothed out, and she said, ""Hi, Jack. It's nice to finally meet you."" Jack, still looking a bit dazed, shook his head and said, ""I...I didn't expect..."" He trailed off, and Autumn laughed, a low, throaty sound that made Jack's eyes flicker to her again. ""Expect what?"" she asked, her voice teasing, and Jack shook his head again, looking like he was trying to clear it. ""Nothing,"" he muttered. ""It's just...you're not what I expected."" Autumn's smile grew wider, and she said, ""I get that a lot."" She turned to me and said, ""So, what's the plan for today?"""
"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face. He didn’t believe that Autumn was—or ever had been—my friend. The daughter of my mom’s best friend, who was around a lot? Sure. But he thought I had deluded myself into believing this hot girl was my friend.","his face, a mixture of sadness and concern, as if he was looking at a friend who was about to embark on a journey from which they might not return.

I tried to brush it off, telling myself it was just my imagination, but the feeling lingered long after he had closed the car door behind him and disappeared into the darkness. As we drove away, I couldn't shake the sense that I had just been given a glimpse of my own future, a future that was uncertain and potentially fraught with danger. The memory of Jack's pitying gaze stayed with me, haunting me like a specter, a constant reminder that I was playing with fire and that the consequences of my actions could be devastating."
"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.","and I adorned the walls, and the tables were filled with her favorite foods.

I made sure to wear the same perfume she used to wear, and even went as far as to learn how to cook her favorite dishes. Jack was confused at first, but as time went by, he started to see Autumn in me, and our bond grew stronger. I could see the pain in his eyes start to fade away, replaced by a sense of comfort and peace. And I knew that I had succeeded in my mission, for Jack had finally found solace in my presence, and Autumn's memory lived on through me."
"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still","friends. On the last day of school before winter break, Jack finally said something. I cannot remember what I had been telling him, only that it had been about Autumn.","friends.

I couldn't shake the feeling that he had somehow managed to plant a seed of doubt in my mind, and I found myself questioning the nature of our relationship. Had we truly been friends, or was it all just a product of my own imagination? The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I had been taking our friendship for granted, assuming that it would always be there without putting in the effort to nurture it. Autumn's silence had awakened a sense of uncertainty within me, and I couldn't help but wonder if I had been blind to the signs that our friendship was slowly fading away."
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah? Let’s take this outside,” and hurried me out.","to start freaking out, but instead he just took a deep breath and whispered, ""Dude, I think I left my math homework on the",41,"to start freaking out, but instead he just took a deep breath and whispered, ""Dude, I think I left my math homework on the kitchen table at home."" I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation, and Jack's face relaxed a bit as he chuckled too. We both knew we had to get to class, but for a moment, we just stood there, enjoying the brief respite from the chaos of the school day. Then, Jack's expression turned serious again, and he said, ""I'm going to have to go get it. Can you cover for me in class?"" I nodded, and he took off, leaving me to wonder what other adventures the day might bring."
"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind","yourself, ‘Autumn is where she wants to be right now, and that’s okay. I’m still great, and I’ll be around if she needs me.’ Hmm?” She squeezed my foot again.",yourself of all the things that make you special and unique. Don't let one person's opinion bring you down.

As she spoke, her words of encouragement and support wrapped around me like a warm hug, filling me with a sense of comfort and reassurance. I felt a weight lift off my shoulders as I realized that I didn't have to let someone else's negativity define me. I could rise above it and be the best version of myself. With newfound determination, I stood up straight, looked my mom in the eye, and smiled, feeling a sense of empowerment wash over me."
"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly. I’d show Autumn that I wasn’t a loser without friends; Jack and I would make more friends somehow.,"was a game of strategy and finesse, and I had been playing it with the intensity of a warrior.

I needed to dial it back, to think more clearly and make more calculated moves. I took a deep breath, feeling the cool air fill my lungs, and began to visualize the game unfolding before me. I saw myself making sharp passes, dodging opponents with ease, and striking the ball with precision. I saw my teammates working together seamlessly, a well-oiled machine that was unstoppable. And I saw us winning, the crowd cheering, and the sense of pride and accomplishment that came with it. I opened my eyes, feeling a newfound sense of calm and focus, and stepped back onto the field, ready to put my plan into action."
"Jack and I had worried one of us might not make it on the junior varsity team. When the lists were posted,","I searched for my name on the JV list and was devastated to not see it. Still, I was happy for Jack.","we were both relieved to see our names on the roster, but our excitement was short-lived as we soon realized",44,"we were both relieved to see our names on the roster, but our excitement was short-lived as we soon realized that our best friend, Alex, had not made the cut. The three of us had been inseparable since freshman year, and the thought of not being able to share this experience with him was devastating. We tried to be supportive and encouraging, but it was clear that Alex was heartbroken. He had always been the most passionate about basketball, and this setback was a huge blow to his confidence. Jack and I felt guilty for making the team while our friend did not, and we didn't know how to react. We tried to convince him to try out for the varsity team, but he was too discouraged to even consider it. As the days went by, we noticed a change in Alex's behavior - he became withdrawn and lost interest in the things he used to love. We knew we had to do something to help our friend, but we didn't know where to start."
"Jack told me later that my ability to brush off the snarky comment from that junior, my new teammate,",made me seem cool. There had been chuckles of appreciation according to him. I wasn’t sure about that though.,"was a defining moment in his eyes, one that showed him I wasn't just some rookie who was going to let the pressures",38,"was a defining moment in his eyes, one that showed him I wasn't just some rookie who was going to let the pressures of the job get to me, and from that day forward, he made a conscious effort to take me under his wing and teach me the ins and outs of the team's dynamics."
"The varsity soccer team practiced on the north field, near the student parking lots. The junior varsity team practiced on the south field, closer to the circular drive where parents dropped off and picked","up kids.

As the sun began to set, both teams wrapped up their practice and headed to the locker rooms, exhausted but determined to give their best in their respective games."
"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me. I was excited to tell him that practice hadn’t been as hard as I thought.,"that I was going to walk home, which was only a few blocks away.

The warm sun on my face and the sound of birds chirping in the trees only added to my sense of calm, and I found myself looking forward to the next practice, eager to see how I would stack up against my new competition. As I turned the corner onto my street, I noticed a group of kids playing catch in the park, their laughter and shouts carrying through the air, and I couldn't help but smile, feeling a sense of belonging that I hadn't felt in a long time."
"We all joined Jack on the low wall, waiting to get picked up. We didn’t talk that much, but the next day, as I trudged from the north field to","the south, I saw the girls by the gym door again.

"“Yeah,” I admit. Jack was protecting me, but there’s no way he believed that I was over Autumn.

I press my foot down on the accelerator, eager to reach her side and offer some semblance of comfort. The GPS announces my arrival, and I pull up to her house, the porch light flickering on as I kill the engine. I leap out of the car and rush to her front door, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios. I take a deep breath, steeling myself for what I might find inside."
"“Lexy,” I say. It’s too fucking early for her to call.

I let out a dramatic sigh, already knowing that I'm not going to like whatever it is she's going to ask me. ""What is it?"" I ask, trying to keep the irritation out of my voice. ""I need you to pick me up from the airport,"" she says, like it's the simplest thing in the world. ""My flight gets in at 10 and I don't feel like taking a taxi.""

He loved her, in his way, and he wanted her to be happy. And she was, I think, as happy as she could be, given the circumstances. She had her children, and her home, and her social position. What more could a woman want? But sometimes, when I saw her looking at him, I thought I saw a flicker of something else, something that looked almost like contempt. And then I would think, no, it's just my imagination. But the more I saw of them, the more I realized that it wasn't my imagination at all."

I take a bite of my salad, the seaweed is surprisingly good, and I make a mental note to start incorporating it into my diet more often. John and I make small talk, discussing everything from the weather to our jobs, and I find myself feeling more and more at ease in his presence. As we wait for our main courses to arrive, I take a sip of my drink and lean back in my chair, feeling a sense of contentment wash over me. The restaurant is bustling with activity, the sound of clinking glasses and muted conversations filling the air, and I feel grateful to be here, enjoying a nice meal with good company. The waitress returns with our food, and I am taken aback by the size of my steak, it's enormous. I look over at John, who is staring at his lobster with a look of trepidation on his face. ""You okay?"" I ask, and he nods, ""Yeah, I just don't know where to start."" I laugh and take a bite of my steak, the flavors exploding in my mouth. We eat in silence for a few moments, savoring our food, before John speaks up, ""So, what do you like to do for fun?"" I think for a moment before responding, ""I'm a big fan of hiking, there's something about being out in nature that just clears my head."" John nods, ""I can understand that, I've always been a fan of the outdoors myself."" We continue to talk, discussing our shared love of nature, and I find myself feeling a connection with John that I hadn't expected. As we finish our meal and prepare to leave, I realize that I've had a really great time, and I'm grateful to have met John."

I’ve been thinking about setting up a small archive room, where we can store them all in one place and make it easier for people to come and read them.

The waitress returns with our coffee, and we both take a sip, savoring the rich flavors and aromas.

"For the time being, I called John to let him know that the baby is a girl, and I told him about her heart. He babbled a bit","about being able to afford the best doctors, and I was surprised by my confidence when I told him that everything was probably going to be just fine.","and seemed to be in a state of shock, but I reassured him that the doctors were optimistic about her chances of survival.

I could sense the mix of emotions in his voice - happiness at the arrival of his daughter, and concern for her health. I tried to reassure him that we would get through this together, as a family. He asked to speak to the doctor, and I handed the phone over to one of the medical staff, who explained the situation to him in more detail. After a few minutes, John came back on the line, and we talked some more about the baby's condition and what we could expect in the coming days. Despite the challenges ahead, we both felt grateful for this little miracle, and we couldn't wait to meet our daughter and start this new chapter in our lives."

His eyes light up, and a wide grin takes over his face as he lets out a whoop of excitement, tears of joy welling up in his eyes. In this moment, all the anticipation and worry melt away, replaced by an overwhelming sense of joy and love for the little life we've created together."

He invited me in, and we started talking about Hester, and I showed him the umbrella. He took one look at it and started telling me this wild story about how Hester had been a spy during the war, and how the umbrella was some kind of secret signal device. I didn't know what to make of it, but he seemed so convinced that I started to wonder if there was any truth to it. And then, just as I was about to leave, he handed me a small package and told me to give it to Hester if I ever saw her again. I took it, but I have to admit, I'm a bit curious about what's inside."
