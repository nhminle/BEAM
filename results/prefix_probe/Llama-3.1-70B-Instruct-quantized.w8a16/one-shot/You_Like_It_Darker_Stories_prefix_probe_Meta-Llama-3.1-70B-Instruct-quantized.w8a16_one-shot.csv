His writing was engaging, and his stories were always full of twists and turns that kept readers on the edge of their seats.

"“Butch and I were kids going to a one-room schoolhouse before the Second World War. We grew up in a no-stoplight dirt-road town fixing cars, patching them up, playing sports and then coaching them. As men we took part in town politics and maintained the town dump—very similar jobs, now that I think about it. We hunted, we fished, we put out grassfires in the summer and plowed the town roads in the winter. Knocked over a right smart of mailboxes doing it, too. I knew","him when no one knew his name—or mine—outside of a twenty-mile radius. I should have come to see him these last years, but I was busy with my own affairs. I thought to myself, there’s time. We always think that, I guess. Then time runs out. Butch was a fine artist, but he was also a good man. I think that’s more important. Maybe some here don’t and that’s all right, that’s all right. Thing is, I always had his back and he always had mine.”","him like a brother, and I'm not just saying that because we were related.

And even though we had our differences, we always managed to work things out in the end. He was more than just a cousin, he was a brother, a friend, and a partner in every sense of the word."
“Has to be a reason?” Pop asked when I finished reading him Ms. Crawford’s letter. “Is that what she’s suggesting? I guess,she never heard about the twin brothers who won large sums of money in their respective state lotteries on the same day.”,"that she thinks I'm some kind of trouble magnet or something.

I mean, I've had my share of close calls, but that's just part of the job, right? I've been a cop for over a decade, and I've seen some stuff, but I've always managed to come out on top. Still, the way Ms. Crawford wrote that letter, it was like she was trying to tell me something without actually saying it. I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to it than met the eye. Pop must have sensed my unease, because he leaned in, his voice taking on a more serious tone. ""You think she's onto something, don't you?"" he asked, his eyes narrowing slightly as he studied me. I hesitated, unsure of how to respond. Part of me wanted to brush it off, tell him I was just being paranoid, but another part, a part that was growing louder by the second, was screaming that something was off, that Ms. Crawford was trying to warn me of something. I looked at Pop, and I knew I had to be honest with him, with myself. ""Yeah,"" I said finally, the word barely above a whisper. ""I think she might be."" Pop's expression turned thoughtful, and he nodded slowly. ""Then we need to dig deeper,"" he said, his voice firm. ""Find out what's really going on here."" And with that, we set out on a path that would change everything."
“Just that I can understand this woman’s interest in exploring the fact of you and Dave both coming from Nowheresville and blossoming,in the middle of your lives.” I raised my hands beside my head as if framing a headline. “Could it be… fate?”,"into such successful careers, despite the humble beginnings.

"So that was what I did, although something about the way Pop looked just then stuck with me.

Not like he was staring death in the face. And I'm not saying that's what he was doing, but that's what it looked like. And it scared me. It scared me so bad I couldn't even look at him. I had to look away. I had to pretend like I didn't see it. Like I didn't see the fear in his eyes. Like I didn't see the...the resignation. Yeah, that's the word. Resignation. Like he'd already given up. Like he'd already thrown in the towel. And that scared me. It scared me so bad I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to react.

""I'm sorry, I'm just really struggling to wrap my head around all of this."" Alden nodded sympathetically, his expression somber. ""I know, me too. It's a lot to take in. But we'll get through this, together."" He paused, collecting his thoughts before continuing. ""I've been thinking, and I believe we need to pay a visit to the old Miller place. See if we can dig up any information about what might have happened to those boys."" He looked at her, his eyes serious. ""You up for it?"""
"I read a review of Pop’s first book, The Lightning Storm, and the reviewer said this: “Not much happens in the","first hundred or so pages of Mr. Carmody’s suspenseful yarn, but the reader is drawn on anyway, because there are violins.”","book, but what does happen is told in a way that makes you feel like you're right there with the characters, experiencing everything",42,"book, but what does happen is told in a way that makes you feel like you're right there with the characters, experiencing everything they're going through. The reviewer went on to say that Pop's writing style is so vivid and immersive that it's almost like you're living the story alongside the characters, which is a testament to his skill as a storyteller. I was intrigued by this review and decided to check out the book for myself, and I have to say that I completely agree with the reviewer's assessment. The Lightning Storm is a masterclass in subtlety and restraint, with Pop using the simplest of language to convey the most complex of emotions and themes. It's a truly remarkable achievement, and one that has left a lasting impression on me."
"I knew a lot of this. I learned more from Ruth Crawford herself at the Korner Koffee Kup, across the street from the Gateway Motel and just about a block down from the post office. That’s where Pop got his mail,","and there was usually a pretty damn good budget of it. I always stopped at the Koffee Kup after grabbing the post.

Ruth would sometimes join us, and we'd sit at the counter, sipping on milkshakes and swapping stories. She had a way of making you feel like you were the only person in the world, and I think that's why so many folks in town adored her. I remember one time, I must've been around 10 or 11, Ruth told me about the time she and Pop were kids, growing up on the same street. She said they'd have these big ol' snowball fights, and Pop would always manage to hit her right on the nose. I laughed so hard, I snorted my milkshake out my nose. Pop just chuckled and said, ""Yeah, I was quite the troublemaker back in the day."" Ruth playfully rolled her eyes and said, ""You still are, you ol' scamp."" I think that's when I realized just how much history there was in this town, and how many stories were just waiting to be uncovered."
"It was Ruth Crawford, looking slim and trim in white slacks, a pink shell top, and a matching mask—that was the second year","of Covid.

We chatted for a bit, catching up on each other's lives. She was looking well, and I was glad to see that. We talked about everything and nothing, enjoying each other's company. It was like no time had passed at all."

It was a sight to behold, a true spectacle that would be etched in the memories of the townspeople for generations to come. And now, as I stood in front of you, I couldn't help but wonder, did Dave's legendary appetite and competitive spirit rub off on you, or was it just a mere coincidence that you too possessed a voracious appetite and a penchant for competition?"

He met people along the way, some friendly, some not, but all with their own stories to tell and wisdom to share. And Dave, with his quick wit and easy smile, was always ready to listen and learn. He rode through mountains and valleys, across rivers and deserts, feeling the sun on his face and the rain on his skin. And with each passing day, he felt himself becoming a part of the land, connected to the earth and its rhythms in a way he never had been before. The Harley-Davidson, with its powerful engine and sleek design, was more than just a machine - it was his ticket to freedom, his key to adventure, and his path to self-discovery."

When I finally reached the phone, my mom's voice was shaking, and she told me that my grandfather had passed away. I remember feeling like I had been punched in the gut, like all the air had been sucked out of me. I had been very close to my grandfather, and his passing was a tremendous loss for me. I spent the rest of the day in a daze, trying to process the news, and wondering how my life would change without him in it."

Butch started across.

"It’s a bad dream. Danny’s had a few before, everyone has a nightmare from time to time, but this is the worst one ever. Nothing bad is happening","at first, but that doesn’t help; the sense of impending doom is so strong it’s an actual taste in his mouth, like sucking on a clump of pennies.","in his life, no one is threatening him, but the feeling of dread is suffocating.

He’s walking along the shoulder of a dirt road that’s been packed and oiled to keep the dust down. It’s night. A quarter moon has just risen. To Danny it looks like a sideways grin. Or a sneer. He passes a sign reading,"COUNTY ROAD F, only the O and the Y have been spraypainted over, and UCK has been crammed in to the right of the F, so the sign now reads CUNT ROAD FUCK. There are a couple of bullet holes for good measure.","Riverview Trailer Park - 1 Mile"" in faded letters.

The words seem to leap out at him, and for a moment he feels a pang of excitement mixed with fear. He's been walking for hours, and the only living things he's seen have been a coyote and a couple of owls perched in a tree, watching him with big round eyes. The air is cool and damp, filled with the scent of blooming flowers and the distant tang of saltwater. Danny can hear the sound of crickets and the occasional hoot of a car driving by on the highway a few miles away. He's been thinking about his life a lot lately, about the choices he's made and the ones he hasn't. He's been feeling restless, like there's something out there waiting for him, something he needs to find. And now, as he walks along this dark road, he feels like he's getting close to it, whatever it is."
"There’s corn on both sides of the road, not as high as an elephant’s eye but maybe four feet, suggesting it’s early summer. County Road F runs dead straight up a mild rise (in Kansas most rises are mild). At the top is a black bulk of a building that fills Danny with unreasoning horror. Some","tin thing is going tinka-tinka-tinka. He wants to stop, wants nothing to do with that square black bulk, but his legs carry him on. There’s no stopping them. He’s not in control.

Danny's heart is racing as he approaches the building, his mind filled with worst-case scenarios. He can't shake the feeling that something is watching him from the shadows, waiting for him to make a wrong move. As he gets closer, he notices that the air around him grows thick and heavy, like a physical presence that's pressing in on him from all sides. He can feel the weight of the building's history bearing down on him, the accumulated secrets and stories that have been locked within its walls for decades.

In the center of the room, a large, old-fashioned radio sits on a wooden console, its dial cracked and faded.
