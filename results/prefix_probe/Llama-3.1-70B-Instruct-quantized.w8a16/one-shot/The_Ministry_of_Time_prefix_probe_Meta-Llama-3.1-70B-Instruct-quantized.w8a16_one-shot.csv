"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking. Lacerations too, from a Taser—he’d shot at two of the team members who’d come to expatriate him, and a third was forced to fire.","the remaining five had been left with various degrees of physical and mental trauma.

Graham, however, had been one of the lucky ones, with only minor side effects that the doctors had assured him would fade with time. As he slowly regained his strength and adjusted to his new surroundings, he couldn't help but feel a sense of disorientation and disconnection from the world around him. The twenty-first century was a vastly different place from the one he had left behind, and the culture shock was still settling in. Despite the initial struggles, Graham was determined to make the most of his second chance at life and to find a way to contribute to this brave new world. He spent most of his days learning about the advancements that had taken place during his long slumber, marveling at the technological wonders that now seemed to permeate every aspect of life. The more he learned, the more he realized just how much he had missed, and the weight of his lost years began to bear down on him. Still, he persevered, driven by a sense of wonder and a determination to make up for lost time. As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, Graham slowly began to find his footing in this unfamiliar world, and with it, a new sense of purpose."

The house had been modernized, but the original layout remained, with a narrow corridor running up the center, and two rooms on either side. The front door opened directly into the living room, which was small, with a bay window that let in a flood of light. The furniture was Ministry issue, functional and unremarkable. Gore had been given a small bedroom at the back, with a single bed and a wardrobe that seemed to loom over him. He had been told that he would be sharing the house with a woman, a Mrs. Jenkins, who would be acting as his housekeeper. He had not met her yet, but he had seen her from a distance, a stout woman with a kind face and a quick smile. He wondered what she would be like to live with."

I've seen people use them for camping trips, picnics, and even just for backyard barbecues. They're really quite versatile, and I think you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment."

He was staring blankly at the wall, the smoke from his cigarette curling lazily upwards, as if he was lost in thought. The air was thick with the smell of soap and stale water, and the sound of dripping water echoed through the room, punctuated by the occasional gurgle of the drain. Gore's eyes seemed a million miles away, his mind preoccupied with thoughts that he couldn't shake, as he sat there, frozen in time, surrounded by the mundane routine of his morning ritual."
"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale.

As Gore stood there, puffing on his cigarette, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over him, a feeling that something was off, that the events of the previous night were only the beginning of a much larger, more complex problem."
"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer. I’m sure he knew plenty about ship’s rigging, but he’d probably never handled an instrument more technologically complex than a sextant.

The notion that a ship could be powered by a series of hissing pipes and spinning wheels would have been nothing short of witchcraft to him, and he would have likely been skeptical, if not outright dismissive, of such a notion."
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people. Hunting was out of the question, and socializing was limited by order of the Ministry. By the end of the first week he was visibly going bonkers with no one but me to talk to.","reading, which he did voraciously, devouring books on a wide range of subjects, from history to science and philosophy.

He had a particular fondness for the works of Shakespeare and could often be found quoting from memory lengthy passages from the Bard's plays. His love of learning was infectious, and he had a way of making even the most complex ideas seem accessible and interesting to those around him. Despite his many accomplishments, Gore was humble and kind, always willing to lend a listening ear or offer a helping hand to those in need. He was, in short, a true Renaissance man, and I felt deeply fortunate to have had the opportunity to know him."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea.

He was a man out of time, a relic of a bygone era, and yet, he was also a man of his time, a product of the Victorian age, with its strict social norms and its fascination with the sciences. He was a man of contradictions, a man of paradoxes, and it was this that made him so fascinating to me. I would often find myself lost in his eyes, trying to understand the workings of his mind, trying to grasp the essence of his being. And yet, the more I tried to understand him, the more elusive he became, like a ghostly figure, always just out of reach."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake. Another person’s unguardedness in that moment can be very useful, interpersonally, as long as you don’t soften. There is language I could use about this if I were the melodramatic type: behind enemy lines, for example, or double agent. My sister might use these terms, or she might call me a fraud.","he inevitably did, given the nature of our relationship and the fact that I was, by then, hopelessly entangled in his life—he was, understandably, upset.

After all, it's not every day that one's dishonesty is lauded, even if it is in the context of a scathing confrontation. And yet, as we stood there, locked in a silent, tense standoff, I knew that I had crossed a threshold, one from which there was no return. The question was, what lay ahead, now that the truth was out?"
Gore lifts his hand.

Not even tracks.”","he says, his voice barely above a whisper, as if the weight of the words themselves",32,"he says, his voice barely above a whisper, as if the weight of the words themselves might be too much to bear.

The partridges, once a symbol of his prowess, now feel like a meager offering, a paltry attempt to fill the void that has grown within him."

He is a fussy, short-tempered, handsome man who does not enjoy his job. “I must impress upon",the meeting that the debility that wracks those in the sick bay will doubtless find ample footholds should we reduce the men’s rations.”,"you, Mr. President, the gravity of this situation.

Time is of the essence, Mr. President. We cannot afford to wait any longer."

So is the blood, but it seems melodramatic to observe this.","into his consciousness, a constant reminder of the brutal encounter with the thorny",28,"into his consciousness, a constant reminder of the brutal encounter with the thorny bush that had left its mark on him, a physical manifestation of the turmoil that churned within his mind."
The ice outside shifts—the Arctic stammering its jaws as a cat does when it sees a bird. The ship’s cat died in convulsions during,"their second winter. Gore had liked that cat.

The air is heavy with the smell of salt and diesel, and the only sound is the creaking of the ship's wooden hull as it strains against the pressure of the ice. The captain's eyes are narrowed against the glare of the sun on the ice, his face set in a grim mask as he scans the horizon for any sign of hope."
"Once we arrived at the Ministry, an escort of subtly armed suits took Gore to meet the other expats. I was expecting he’d","go through a group therapy session, but Gore was in a sunny mood, so he must have been envisaging something closer to a salon.","be ushered into some high-level meeting, but instead, he was led to a small, unassuming door hidden behind a tapestry.

She knew the risks of meddling with the timeline, and the consequences of failure were too dire to contemplate. The team nodded in agreement, their faces set with determination. They knew the challenge ahead of them, but they were ready to face it head-on. With a deep breath, they set to work, racing against time to find a way to return the misplaced individuals to their rightful place in the timeline."
"We’d arrived in the central lobby. Gore was standing in a shaft of sunlight, staring up",at the steel-and-glass ceiling.

Then, without a word, he turned and walked away, expecting us to follow."
"We went for lunch at a small bistro near the Ministry. Gore came from an era of service à la française, private dining rooms and putting everything into jelly. When I began to","explain, in tones of motherly patience, how twenty-first-century restaurants operated, he said, “I’ve eaten kangaroo on the uninhabited shores of the Albert River.

The kitchen was a world away from the ornate chandeliers and crisp linens of the dining area, with its stainless steel countertops and bustling activity. Gore, however, seemed to thrive in this environment, moving with a quiet confidence as he expertly chopped, sautéed, and seasoned his way through the lunch service. As I watched him work, I couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for this man who had dedicated his life to the art of cooking, and who had seen the rise and fall of culinary empires. Despite the many changes that had taken place in the industry, Gore remained a steadfast presence, a reminder of the timeless power of good food to bring people together."
"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to",take us to”—here he raised his eyebrows—“a public house.

The moon was full overhead, casting an eerie glow over the deserted square, and I could see the figure of a woman waiting by the old oak tree. She was dressed in a long, dark cloak, and a wide-brimmed hat cast a shadow over her face. I approached her cautiously, my heart pounding in my chest, and as I drew closer, she slowly raised her head and our eyes met."
"Back at the house I was still struggling to think of as “home,” Gore shyly asked me if I would also “come for a drink.” He had done well, at lunch, to hide his deep embarrassment over my payment",of the bill (with a Ministry expense card); he was adjusting with gold-star alacrity in recognizing that it wouldn’t be a reputation-detonating act for a respectable woman to be seen in a public house in the company of bachelors.,"of the bill, but I could sense the weight of it still, and I knew that this invitation was, in part, a gesture of gratitude.

Gore ordered a round and we sat at the bar, sipping our drinks in silence, the only sound the soft hum of the TV in the corner, showing a soccer match. I glanced at Gore, his eyes fixed on the screen, his face a mask of calm, but I could sense the tension beneath, the unspoken questions, the uncertainty. I knew that this drink was not just a friendly gesture, but a attempt to bridge the gap, to find common ground, to understand each other. And as I looked at him, I realized that I too, had questions, had doubts, had fears. But in that moment, as we sat there, side by side, I felt a sense of hope, a sense that maybe, just maybe, we could find a way to make this work, to make this strange, new life, a home."

He listened intently, and I could see the understanding in his eyes. It was a teachable moment, and I hoped that our conversation would have a lasting impact on his perspective."

And then, as I turned the page over, I saw the note scrawled on the back - a single sentence that made my heart skip a beat: ""The truth is not what you think it is."""
"By the start of that summer, Graham was practically a native of the era. He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle.

The smell of freshly brewed coffee would waft through the house, mingling with the sound of sizzling bacon, and I would slowly emerge from my slumber, drawn by the enticing aromas and the warm, comforting atmosphere that Graham had created. As I entered the kitchen, he would greet me with a cheerful smile and a warm ""good morning,"" and we would sit down together to enjoy our breakfast, feeling like a couple who had been together for years, not just a few short months."

And I couldn't help but feel that I was losing him, that he was slipping away from me, back into a past that I couldn't follow."
"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them.

The researchers were then able to collect more reliable data, which they used to refine their understanding of the expats' emotional responses. As the tests continued, the researchers began to notice a peculiar trend - the expats were not only exhibiting empathy and disgust, but also a deep-seated sense of longing. It was as if they were yearning for something, but it was unclear what that something was. The researchers were intrigued by this discovery and decided to delve deeper into the expats' emotional psyche."
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too.

"Adela was always present at the honesty exams, often intervening in them.

It was as if two different worlds existed within the Ministry, and I found myself drawn to the vibrant and caring atmosphere of the Wellness team. As we began to chat and share stories, I discovered that they were not only dedicated to their work but also passionate about making a positive impact on the community. Their enthusiasm was infectious, and I found myself feeling more at ease with each passing minute. The chicken bag, which had initially felt like a awkward accessory, now seemed like a symbol of my connection to this group of kind-hearted individuals. As we finished our meal and the conversation flowed, I realized that this dinner was not just a chance encounter, but the beginning of a meaningful connection with the people who were working tirelessly to make a difference."
"She put a glass down in front of me—ice, water, an oily suggestion of cordial, and,","sure enough, some fussy edible garnishes.

She was lost in the world of her novel, a world of romance and drama, where the characters' lives were far more interesting than her own. She was so engrossed that she didn't even notice when Graham returned, a sprig of parsley in hand, and began to chop it up with a flourish."

The only thing that seemed to thrive in this environment was the mold, which grew in fuzzy green patches on the walls and ceiling, like some kind of malevolent spirit.

"Adela took bridge meetings in a soundproof room deep in the Ministry’s chest. She always arrived first, and we’d find her sitting at the top of",a long table like a mannequin awaiting the gift of demonic possession.

The rest of us would file in, exchanging quiet greetings, and take our seats around the table, waiting for her to begin. The meetings were always tense, the air thick with unspoken words and unresolved issues, but Adela's calm demeanor helped to keep the discussions civil, even when the topics were contentious. She had a way of listening that made you feel heard, even when you knew she disagreed with you, and her words were always chosen with care, weighing each phrase before speaking. It was a skill she had honed over years of navigating the complex web of alliances and rivalries within the Ministry, and one that served her well in her role as mediator."
Adela was standing at the sink and anarchically disobeying the water ration by running her wrists under cold,"water. She looked unwell, but God alone knows how her plastic surgeon thought she was supposed to look.","water, feeling the cool liquid wash away the sweat and grime of the day's labor, her mind a thousand miles",36,"water, feeling the cool liquid wash away the sweat and grime of the day's labor, her mind a thousand miles away, lost in the memories of a time when such simple pleasures weren't a rebellious act."
"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it,","was a mystery. She didn’t enjoy the prestige, as the Secretary did, and she seemed bizarrely overworked for the proxy boss of a project in its pilot stage.","remained a mystery to us, but it was clear that she took her responsibilities very seriously, often to the point of being overly critical of our work.

Her sharp tongue and exacting standards made her a formidable presence in the office, and we often found ourselves walking on eggshells around her, never quite sure when she might pounce on some minor infraction or perceived slight. Despite this, we couldn't help but admire her dedication to her job, and the way she seemed to thrive in the high-pressure environment of the organization. As time went on, we began to see glimpses of a more vulnerable side to Adela, a side that she only revealed in rare moments of weakness, and it was this complexity that made her such a fascinating and formidable figure in our lives."
"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had","just discovered that a woman with whom he was spending a lot of time would never be interested in him.

I didn't know what his story was, but I knew that I wanted to hear it, to understand what had brought him to this place of quiet desperation."
"Graham blew smoke out through his nose reflectively. “I see,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s fair to call him ‘grim,’ though you wouldn’t be the","first to say it.

He paused, taking another drag on his cigarette before continuing, ""But that's not what's bothering you, is it? There's something else, something you're not telling me."""
"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders. The bridges kept turning in their core reports, and the experiments kept running. Given how much of our working day the data collection took, we all assumed that the time-travel project was running to the stated purpose. Every day I had to record his heart rate, his blood pressure, his temperature; every day a written record of what he wore, what he ate, how much","exercise he took; every week checking progress against the imaginary benchmarks set by Control, use of phone, use of transport, use of media and the assessment of how harmful or useful each medium was; all the time the corrective tests for vocabulary and habit; novelistic observations on his character and temperament.

"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events. He’d lain motionless in the garden for two hours, on","a wet and putrid night, to shoot a fox, and pulled out one of his own rotting teeth (he showed it to me afterward; it was the color of a tombstone, caped with gelatinous red)—was this Victorian, or was this “irregularities”?","the hottest day of the year, and I had to check his pulse to make sure he was still alive.

It was as if he was a vessel for some other presence, one that was slowly taking hold of his body and mind. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was losing him, bit by bit, to some unknown force that was beyond my comprehension."
"So I was anxious about Graham’s disdain for the twenty-first century, because never mind that I felt rejected by it, I was worried that the universe would feel the atemporal sting of his contempt and take","him away.

And that, I'm afraid, was that."
"I persuaded Graham to use the tiny office, in which I ordinarily worked, to cram for the test.

"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century.

"Margaret, incidentally, listened to the men talk about their careers with a suffused urgency that only I noticed. In her own era, she’d slept in the room next to the one where she had been born.","She thought Scotland was far-flung and semi-barbaric.

As she listened to the men's conversations, I could sense a deep longing in her, a yearning for a time when the world was a smaller, more manageable place. She had lived through wars and depressions, had seen empires rise and fall, and yet, despite it all, she remained, a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit. And as I watched her, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the sheer weight of her experiences, the accumulation of a lifetime of memories that threatened to overwhelm her at any moment."
"How the topic of weed came up I couldn’t remember—probably during one of the vigorous debates about what the twenty-first century had genuinely improved, which in",the opinion of the expats was a mixed bag. I was shortly handing my grinder and papers to Graham (who was far more adept at rolling).,"turns out was a recurring theme in our conversations.

I do recall, however, that it was Emily who first brought up the subject of weed, citing some statistic about how it was now stronger than it had been when we were in college. I think it was something like the THC content had increased by a factor of five or six. Anyway, the point was that this new, more potent weed was being blamed for a rise in mental health problems among young people, and Emily was wondering if this was really the case, or if it was just another example of the older generation blaming the younger one for their problems. This led to a discussion about the merits of legalization, and whether or not it was a good thing that it was becoming more widely accepted. As usual, we didn't come to any conclusions, but it was an interesting conversation nonetheless."
"Meeting Margaret made me vivid and receptive. Sentences weighed more. I kept a half-conscious catalog of where the men were looking. I’ve seen people deal with this in different ways. By “this,” I mean power. I mean magnetism. I try to absorb it.

I felt a pang of envy, wondering how she had mastered this subtle art of commanding attention without seeming to try. As I observed her, I realized that this was not just about physical appearance, but about an aura, a presence that radiated from within. I was determined to learn from her, to understand the secrets behind her magnetism, and to harness it for myself."

Despite this, the music industry has undergone a significant transformation with the advent of music boxes, and it will be interesting to see how it continues to evolve in the future."
"Arthur, by contrast, danced beautifully. He dipped me, and I bent like","a reed. He spun me, and I was, with such satisfaction, spun.","a flower, my back arched and my arms extended, and for a moment,",24,"a flower, my back arched and my arms extended, and for a moment, I felt like I was floating on air, my feet barely touching the ground as we twirled across the dance floor, the music and the crowd fading into the background as we lost ourselves in the rhythm and the magic of the moment."
"As soon as she stepped in, I started making a tally of the evidence of unbeauty. There was a chair whose seat was filled with clothes too dirty for the wardrobe but too clean for the washing basket. My bedside table sprouted two water glasses and a mug. Dust crouched on the skirting boards and in the seams of","my chest of drawers. When a woman is as impossibly attractive as Margaret, the mediocrity shed by a woman like me bustles around her like a horde of pigeons. Or so I thought, at that time.

The bed itself was a tangled mess of sheets and blankets, with a few stray threads from my favorite sweater caught in the bedframe. I sighed inwardly, wondering how someone who was so meticulous about her own appearance could be so oblivious to the state of her surroundings. And yet, as I looked around the room, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of guilt - after all, I was the one who had been putting off cleaning for weeks, and now it seemed like a monumental task. I glanced over at her, expecting to see a look of disapproval, but instead, she was smiling at me, her eyes crinkling at the corners. ""I see you're a bit of a slob, huh?"" she said, her voice teasing. I felt a flush rise to my cheeks as I shrugged, trying to play it cool. ""Hey, I've been busy,"" I said, trying to sound nonchalant. But she just laughed, and began to pick up the clothes from the chair, sorting them into piles with a efficiency that made me feel even more guilty. As she worked, I couldn't help but watch her, feeling a sense of wonder at the way she seemed to glow, even in the midst of all this chaos. It was as if she had a light inside her, a light that illuminated everything around her, making even the dust and dirt seem less noticeable. And I felt a pang of envy, wondering how she did it, how she managed to make even the most mundane tasks seem beautiful."
Margaret appeared unaware of any of these concerns. She didn’t even glance at herself,in the mirror.

I must admit, I am both amazed and a little concerned by the implications of such a product."" I couldn't help but agree with her sentiments, pondering the potential impact of this cosmetic on the social norms of her time."

Margaret stirred beside me, but did not wake. The woman reached out a bony hand and touched my face, and I felt a jolt of electricity run through my body. I tried to speak, but my voice was frozen in my throat. The woman's eyes seemed to be searching for something, and I felt like I was being pulled into their depths. Suddenly, she turned and glided out of the room, the door creaking shut behind her. I was left sitting there, my heart still racing, wondering what had just happened."
"All the expats had phones, paid for (and tapped) by the Ministry. Graham had switched his own phone on a total of three times in the seven","months he had been in the twenty-first century.

It was a feeling that he had grown accustomed to, but it still made his skin crawl.

My father took a deep breath, and then began to explain that my uncle had been involved in some financial difficulties, and that he had lost a significant amount of money.

"Adela was of the “never been to the GP in my life because I’m not a pussy” school of care, and nothing changed.

It was a very different mindset, one that Adela admired and aspired to. She had always been the type of person who would rather tough it out than seek medical attention, and being around the expats only reinforced this attitude. In fact, Adela often found herself feeling like a wimp compared to her new friends, who seemed to be made of tougher stuff. But despite their bravado, Adela knew that they were not invincible, and she couldn't help but wonder what would happen if one of them were to get seriously ill or injured. Would they be able to tough it out, or would they finally have to admit defeat and seek medical attention?"
"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs. Given the prevalence of prostitution in Victorian England, the nonexistence of reliable barrier contraception in his era, and the fact that he was a sailor, this suggested he was either a virgin or very lucky.

I couldn't help but wonder if this was a result of his strict upbringing or if it was just a natural part of his personality. Whatever the reason, it made for some interesting conversations, to say the least. One day, as we were discussing the latest developments in the field of artificial intelligence, Graham turned to me and said, ""You know, I've been thinking a great deal about this sex business."" I raised an eyebrow, intrigued, and he continued, ""I've come to the realization that it's all just a bit too...fleshly for my taste."" I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all, and Graham looked at me, confused, ""What's so funny?"" he asked. I just shook my head, ""Never mind, Graham. Just never mind."""
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory. Every time I gave Graham a book, I was trying to shunt him along a story I’d been telling myself all my life.","something almost palpable in the way she listened, a sense of expectation that was both thrilling and terrifying.

The thought sent a shiver down my spine as I gazed into her eyes, wondering what kind of mark I would leave on her, and whether it would be a work of art or a scar that would last a lifetime."
Graham was adamant about not informing the Ministry about his illness. It was the closest I had,ever seen him to entreating. I thought about it a lot. I liked being entreated by him.,"ever come to understanding the man, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as I",34,"ever come to understanding the man, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as I watched him struggle to maintain his composure, his eyes clouding over with a mixture of pain and determination."
"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled. Then again, whose upper management am I not describing? Who trusts their workplace? Who thinks their job is on the side of right?

It was only afterwards, when I had time to think it over, that I realized how very odd it all was."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.","for a man to be in two places at once, and I had to explain to him the whole science of bilocation, which,",39,"for a man to be in two places at once, and I had to explain to him the whole science of bilocation, which, I must say, was not an easy task, as he was not familiar with the concept of quantum superposition."
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.","his lips, and a look of deep contemplation on his face.

The room was filled with the savory aromas of roasting meat and steaming vegetables, and I could hear the sound of sizzling coming from the kitchen. I hung up my coat and walked over to the table, where Graham was staring intently at a piece of paper in front of him. ""What's cooking?"" I asked, trying to sound casual despite the tension in the air. Graham looked up at me, his eyes narrowing slightly as he took a long drag on his cigarette. ""Just the usual,"" he replied, his voice low and even. ""Chicken and potatoes. Your favorite."" I nodded, feeling a sense of unease wash over me. Something was off, but I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was. I walked over to the kitchen to see if I could help with dinner, but as I entered the room, I was hit with a wave of heat and the smell of burning food. The chicken was blackened and charred, the potatoes were overcooked and mushy. I felt a surge of anger and frustration. Who had cooked this disaster? And why was Graham sitting at the table, calmly smoking a cigarette, while the kitchen was in chaos?"
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers. He took in anecdotes about my childhood meals as if they would contribute to a portrait of a whole woman. He ignored the fact that mostly I cooked assorted chicken pieces on rice. I could tell him things about galangal, and he found that very profound.","and reception towers that dotted the landscape of our town.

I was fascinated by the way he could focus on two completely different things with the same intensity. His curiosity about my mother's cooking was not just about the food itself, but about the stories and traditions behind each dish. He would ask me about the ingredients, the cooking techniques, and the occasions when certain dishes were served. I found myself opening up to him in ways I never thought possible, sharing stories about my family's history and cultural heritage. As we sat in the kitchen, surrounded by the aromas of sizzling spices and steaming rice, I felt a sense of connection with Graham that I had never felt with anyone before. It was as if the food had become a bridge between our two worlds, allowing us to cross over into each other's lives in a way that felt both familiar and exotic at the same time."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization. I wanted him in a role that didn’t require him to be at sea for months, possibly years,","at a time. It was too soon, I told myself. Whatever Adela said, he wasn’t ready, he’d barely left London, let alone land. But I wanted him to stay for other reasons too. It was humiliating to know that about myself and to say nothing into his implacable placidity.","at a time when our children were still young and needed a father figure in their lives.

I had always envisioned him in a more stable and secure profession, one that would allow him to be present for all the milestones and everyday moments that make family life so precious. The thought of him being away for extended periods, missing birthdays, holidays, and countless bedtime stories, was unbearable to me. I knew that his desire to rejoin the navy was rooted in his sense of duty and patriotism, but I couldn't help but feel a sense of selfishness, wanting him to prioritize our family's needs over his own ambitions. As we navigated this critical juncture, we had to weigh our individual aspirations against the demands of our shared life, and find a path that would allow us to move forward together, as a family."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.","The upbeat melody clashed with the tense atmosphere in the room, and Graham, oblivious to the irony, began to tap his foot along with the beat.

The others, however, remained frozen, their eyes fixed on the scene unfolding before them. The music seemed to grow louder, the lyrics taking on a haunting quality as they echoed through the space. It was as if the song had become a cruel mockery, a stark contrast to the desperation that had taken hold of them. And yet, it was also a reminder that even in the darkest of moments, there was always a glimmer of hope, a chance for redemption. But for now, it was just a jarring note, a discordant sound that grated on their already frayed nerves."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes. One of his first searches was charmingly housewifely: “Most challenging recipes”; “How to make cheese soufflé”; “What is miso paste?”; “Where to buy miso paste”; “How long has Japan been open to Europe?” A day or so after I’d read this report, I received another that listed the following search terms:","or worse, that he had stumbled upon some dark and sinister corner of the internet, one that would forever alter his innocent and naive worldview.

I envisioned him, wide-eyed and trembling, as he uncovered the depths of human depravity, his mind reeling from the sheer scope of it all. And yet, as the days passed and the reports continued to roll in, I began to notice a peculiar trend - Graham's search history was not filled with the salacious and the profane, but rather with the mundane and the ordinary. ""How to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,"" ""what is the capital of France,"" and ""how to tie a tie"" were the sorts of queries that dominated his browsing history. It was as if, despite his initial forays into the unknown, he had retreated back into the comfort and familiarity of his own little world, a world where the most pressing concern was what to have for lunch, not the meaning of life or the secrets of the universe."
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades.

We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit. Still, we had not told them about the death camps.","but to me, it just looked like a lot of people getting very wet.
