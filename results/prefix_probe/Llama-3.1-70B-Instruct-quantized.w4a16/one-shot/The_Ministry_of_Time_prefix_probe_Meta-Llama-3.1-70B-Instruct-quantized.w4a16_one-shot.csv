"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking. Lacerations too, from a Taser—he’d shot at two of the team members who’d come to expatriate him, and a third was forced to fire.","the remaining five were still struggling to adjust to their new surroundings.

Graham, however, had been deemed fit for duty and was now standing in the middle of a bustling operations room, trying to make sense of the unfamiliar equipment and jargon that seemed to be the norm in this strange new world. As he scanned the room, his eyes landed on a large screen displaying a map of the globe, with various symbols and markers indicating ongoing operations and hotspots. He felt a shiver run down his spine as he realized the sheer scale of the world's conflicts and the complexity of the systems in place to manage them. A gentle voice interrupted his thoughts, and he turned to see a young woman with a kind smile and a clipboard approaching him. ""Commander Gore, welcome to the team. I'm Lieutenant Thompson, your liaison officer. We've got a lot to catch you up on, but first, let's get you settled in and briefed on your role here."" Graham nodded, still trying to process the overwhelming amount of information, and followed Lieutenant Thompson out of the operations room and into the unknown."
"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into","his eighties. As it was, he was thirty-seven years old and had not experienced crinolines, A Tale of Two Cities, or the enfranchisement of the working classes.","the early twentieth century.

The house had been modified over the years, with a small extension added to the back and a dormer window inserted into the roof, but it still retained much of its original character. The front door, painted a deep shade of blue, opened onto a narrow hallway with a staircase curving up to the left. The interior was decorated in a style that was functional rather than fashionable, with cream-painted walls and dark-stained woodwork. Gore would have recognized the layout, the proportions of the rooms, and the way the light fell through the windows, but he would have been surprised by the furnishings, which were modern and minimalist. The Ministry had provided everything that was necessary for a comfortable life, from a well-equipped kitchen to a small garden at the back, but there was no sign of personal touches, no family photographs or favorite possessions. It was a house that was waiting for someone to make it a home."

The air was thick with the smell of tobacco and dampness, and the sound of dripping water echoed through the small room. Gore's gaze was fixed on the image in the mirror, his mind preoccupied with the events of the previous night, and the decisions that lay ahead. He took another long drag on his cigarette, the ember glowing brightly in the dim light, as he sat there, lost in thought."
"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale. A vile smell was seeping up from the floor.","plumber, a gruff but lovable man named Joe, was already on his way to the house, having been summoned by Gore's",39,"plumber, a gruff but lovable man named Joe, was already on his way to the house, having been summoned by Gore's frantic phone call the night before. As the sun rose over the small town, the sound of dripping water echoed through the empty halls, a constant reminder of the chaos that was to come. Meanwhile, Gore paced back and forth in the kitchen, his mind racing with the endless list of tasks that needed to be completed before the house could be deemed habitable. The air was thick with the smell of smoke and sweat, a potent mix that seemed to cling to everything it touched. Despite the mayhem, Gore felt a sense of excitement building in his chest, a sense of possibility that he hadn't felt in years. This old house, with all its quirks and flaws, was going to be his home, and he was determined to make it shine."
"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer. I’m sure he knew plenty about ship’s rigging, but he’d probably never handled an instrument more technologically complex than a sextant. Men in their right minds are","not usually overcome with a mania for pulling the plumbing apart. I suggested he might like to wash his hands at the sink downstairs, and I could, perhaps, call a plumber, and we could, potentially, take a constitutional walk on the nearby heath.","unlikely to have attempted to navigate the complexities of a modern computer system, let alone a spacecraft's control panel.

The thought of him trying to comprehend the intricacies of orbital mechanics or the subtleties of interstellar communication would have been almost laughable. And yet, here he was, a relic from a bygone era, thrust into a world of advanced technology and cutting-edge science. It was a testament to his adaptability and determination that he had managed to survive this long, but it was clear that he was struggling to keep up with the demands of his new environment. As he stared at the unfamiliar controls, his mind racing with the implications of his situation, it was hard not to wonder how much longer he could continue to cope."
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people. Hunting was out of the question, and socializing was limited by order of the Ministry. By the end of the first week he was visibly going bonkers with no one but me to talk to.","reading, devouring books on a wide range of subjects, from philosophy to science and history.

He had a passion for learning that was contagious, and his love for life was evident in the way he approached every new experience. As I spent more time with him, I found myself drawn to his zest for living, and I began to see the world through his eyes, discovering new wonders and marvels that I had previously overlooked. His enthusiasm was infectious, and soon I found myself sharing his excitement for the simple things in life, like watching a sunset or listening to the songs of birds. Gore's presence had a profound impact on me, and I felt grateful to have had the opportunity to know him, to learn from him, and to be inspired by his remarkable spirit."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea. He told me stories as if he were trying to catch himself in amber.

It was as if he had stepped out of a time machine, observing the world around him with a mixture of fascination and bewilderment. His eyes would light up with excitement as he discovered something new, a gadget or a phrase that was unfamiliar to him. And yet, despite his fish-out-of-water demeanor, he possessed an uncanny ability to adapt, to navigate the complexities of modern life with a ease that belied his antiquated appearance. It was a trait that served him well in his line of work, allowing him to move seamlessly between the past and the present, always staying one step ahead of the curve."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake. Another person’s unguardedness in that moment can be very useful, interpersonally, as long as you don’t soften.

I wasn't sure I was ready for that, for someone to really see me, to know the truth about who I was and where I came from. But at the same time, I couldn't help but feel drawn to it, to the possibility of being truly understood. It was a risk, I knew, but it was one I was willing to take, at least for now."

He’s left a smear on the table the color of tamarind flesh.,"There is a sour, steady pain in his palm that he briefly misunderstands as a taste.","The stain seems to be spreading, like a dark flower blooming in the sterile environment",32,"The stain seems to be spreading, like a dark flower blooming in the sterile environment of the laboratory, and for a moment, it's as if the very essence of the fruit has been transferred to the cold, metallic surface."
"Gore considers the weight of the sack he’d carried, which had felt so meaningful. “Three partridges,”","he says, “and a boatswain gull too far off to hit. Nothing else. Not even tracks.”","he says, shaking his head in wonder, “and a few scraps of bread, a flask of water,",32,"he says, shaking his head in wonder, “and a few scraps of bread, a flask of water, and a small sack of flour – it was hardly enough to sustain a man for more than a day or two, and yet it had felt like the weight of the world to him as he trudged through the forest, the straps digging into his shoulders like a physical manifestation of his own desperation and fear.”"
"At this, Stanley leans in.

"Once we arrived at the Ministry, an escort of subtly armed suits took Gore to meet the other expats. I was expecting he’d","go through a group therapy session, but Gore was in a sunny mood, so he must have been envisaging something closer to a salon.","be whisked away to some high-level meeting, but instead, he was led to a small, windowless room deep in the Ministry's basement.",47,"be whisked away to some high-level meeting, but instead, he was led to a small, windowless room deep in the Ministry's basement.

"We’d arrived in the central lobby. Gore was standing in a shaft of sunlight, staring up",at the steel-and-glass ceiling.

I followed his gaze, trying to see what had captured his attention, but there was nothing out of the ordinary to be seen - just the usual array of gleaming marble and polished steel that seemed to characterize this entire complex. Still, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that there was more to this place than met the eye."
"We went for lunch at a small bistro near the Ministry. Gore came from an era of service à la française, private dining rooms and putting everything into jelly.

As we ate, our conversation turned to the intricacies of diplomacy and the delicate balance of power within the Ministry, and I found myself drawn into a world of subtle maneuvering and high-stakes politics."
"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to",take us to”—here he raised his eyebrows—“a public house.

"Back at the house I was still struggling to think of as “home,” Gore shyly asked me if I would also “come for a drink.” He had done well, at lunch, to hide his deep embarrassment over my payment",of the bill (with a Ministry expense card); he was adjusting with gold-star alacrity in recognizing that it wouldn’t be a reputation-detonating act for a respectable woman to be seen in a public house in the company of bachelors.,"of the bill, but I could tell he was still feeling a bit self-conscious about the whole thing.

"Graham used other words too, not wrong, exactly, but not right, like “your people,” or “your culture.” When I said, in a wincingly tight voice, that we had the same people and culture, he replied, mildly, “But I don’t think that we do.” Then came the image searches about Cambodia, on food and dress","and customs.

His dedication to blending in was impressive, and I often found myself wondering how someone who had traveled through time could adapt so seamlessly. The way he moved with a quiet confidence, his mannerisms and speech patterns all perfectly in tune with the era, was a testament to his determination to fit in. Despite his efforts, however, there were still moments when his true nature would peek through, a fleeting glance or a misplaced word that would remind me of the incredible circumstances that had brought him here."
"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past. I was prickly and defensive about","this; I could not look at why directly. I heard the way I spoke to him about it: adjustment, reasonable, citizen, responsibility, values. He blew a lot of pensive cigarette smoke at me.","the way he spoke about the modern world, as if his criticisms were a personal attack on me and my way of life.

I couldn't help but feel that he was judging me, that he saw me as a product of this century, flawed and inferior. His words cut deep, and I often found myself wondering if I was somehow less than him, if my experiences and perspectives were less valid because I hadn't lived through the same struggles and hardships that he had. But at the same time, I was drawn to his passion, his conviction, and his unwavering commitment to his values. I admired the way he stood by his principles, even when it meant standing alone, and I couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy for the sense of purpose and direction that he seemed to possess."
"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them. Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled","to focus on the tests—eyes moving rapidly.

The change of scenery seemed to help, and the expats began to settle into the routine of the tests. They were shown images and videos, asked to read stories and respond to hypothetical scenarios, all designed to elicit a specific emotional response. The researchers watched their every move, monitored their vital signs, and took meticulous notes. As the weeks went by, the expats grew accustomed to the probing and prodding, but they couldn't shake the feeling that they were being slowly unraveled, their deepest fears and desires laid bare for the sake of science. And yet, they continued to participate, driven by a mix of curiosity and desperation, hoping that the tests might somehow, someway, lead to a breakthrough in their quest to understand the strange and wondrous world they found themselves in."
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too. Even Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had","fought in large-scale battles, were laid out by the ultramodern scope of the harm.

The test was eventually scrapped, but not before it had caused a significant amount of distress among the expats. The incident raised questions about the ethics of using such graphic and disturbing content in the empathy exams, and whether it was truly necessary to assess their emotional intelligence. As a result, the testing methods were revised, and more consideration was given to the potential impact on the expats' mental health. Meanwhile, Nineteen-sixteen's reaction had sparked a new area of research, focusing on the long-term effects of exposure to traumatic events on individuals with unique neurological profiles. The study aimed to develop more effective coping mechanisms and support systems for those who had experienced extreme stress and anxiety. Graham, in particular, was invested in this research, as he had witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of the test on his fellow expats. He worked closely with the researchers, sharing his insights and helping to design more humane and effective testing methods. As the study progressed, the expats began to heal and rebuild, but the memory of the traumatic test lingered, serving as a reminder of the importance of prioritizing their well-being and safety above all else."
"Adela was always present at the honesty exams, often intervening in them. I got the impression that she was listening to offstage prompts that only she could","hear, being the only one among us who was aware she was on a stage, and was trying to chivvy us along the right course of action.","hear, and that these unheard voices were guiding her actions.

As I watched her in action, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and curiosity about the mysterious forces that seemed to be at work in these exams."
"Adela smiled with about a third of her mouth. Her face had changed again.

"I went along to one of the earliest dinners, chicken bag slung over my shoulder.

The conversation around the table was muted, with everyone focused on their food, but I caught snippets of discussion about the latest Wellness initiative and the upcoming team-building exercise. As I ate, I couldn't help but feel a sense of detachment from the rest of the team. I had always been an outsider, and it seemed that no matter how hard I tried, I would never quite fit in. The operators, with their crisp uniforms and neatly pressed hair, seemed to embody the very essence of the Ministry, while I, with my worn jeans and faded t-shirt, stuck out like a sore thumb. I finished my meal in silence, lost in thought, as the others around me chatted and laughed, their camaraderie and shared experiences a stark contrast to my own isolation."
"She put a glass down in front of me—ice, water, an oily suggestion of cordial, and,","sure enough, some fussy edible garnishes. I blinked at it and then at Margaret, who smiled.","a slice of lemon, its yellow a faint echo of the sun that had long since set, casting the room",32,"a slice of lemon, its yellow a faint echo of the sun that had long since set, casting the room in a warm orange glow that seemed to emanate from the very walls themselves, a comforting ambiance that stood in stark contrast to the turmoil brewing inside me."
"Graham said, “Hm!” and pulled hard on his cigarette.

He strolled through the garden, his eyes scanning the neatly trimmed hedges and the vibrant flowers that seemed to dance in the gentle breeze. The sound of children's laughter carried on the wind, mingling with the sweet scent of blooming roses, and Graham felt a pang of nostalgia wash over him. He had always loved this time of day, when the world seemed to slow down and the beauty of nature was at its most breathtaking. As he turned a corner, he spotted a small, rusty gate hidden behind a tangle of overgrown bushes. His curiosity piqued, Graham pushed the gate open and slipped through, finding himself in a narrow, winding path that seemed to lead to a secret world beyond the garden's manicured borders."
"“No,” said Margaret. She shrugged at my expression. “An’ I forsake this duty,” she said, “we’ll sicken. Forty-seven",thinks tobacco is an herb.

The Brigadier drifted closer. He did look hungry. He looked like I did as a student when I ate nothing but buttered,toast and apples. He turned the white of used candlewax when Margaret opened the oven to better squint at her roast potatoes.,"toast for a week because I couldn't afford anything else.

There was a desperation in his eyes, a hunger that went beyond the physical, and I felt a shiver run down my spine as he drew closer."

Graham's absence was a welcome relief, as I didn't have to worry about making small talk or pretending to be interested in his mundane conversations. The silence was a balm to my frazzled nerves, and I reveled in the solitude. But as the days turned into a week, and the week into what felt like an eternity, I began to feel the effects of isolation. My mind started to wander, and I found myself wondering if anyone would even notice if I just disappeared. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I pushed it aside, focusing instead on the sound of my own ragged breathing. And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the heat wave broke, leaving behind a sense of unease and disquiet that lingered long after the temperature dropped."
"Adela took bridge meetings in a soundproof room deep in the Ministry’s chest.

Her voice was always calm and collected, but there was an undercurrent of tension that seemed to vibrate through every word, a sense that the decisions made in this room would have far-reaching consequences. As the meetings progressed, the discussion would grow more heated, with different factions vying for dominance, but Adela remained steadfast, her eyes locked on some point in the distance, her expression unyielding. It was as if she could see something that the rest of us couldn't, some hidden pattern or trajectory that only she was privy to. And when the meetings finally adjourned, and we filed out of the soundproof room, the sense of tension would linger, a palpable presence that seemed to seep into every corner of the Ministry."
Adela was standing at the sink and anarchically disobeying the water ration by running her wrists under cold,"water. She looked unwell, but God alone knows how her plastic surgeon thought she was supposed to look.","water, feeling the cool liquid soothe her parched skin as she stared out the window at the dry, cracked",36,"water, feeling the cool liquid soothe her parched skin as she stared out the window at the dry, cracked earth that seemed to stretch on forever, a constant reminder of the severe drought that had been plaguing their small town for months.

She closed her eyes, letting the water cascade down her arms, and felt a sense of momentary peace wash over her, a fleeting respite from the worries that had been weighing on her mind."
"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it,","was a mystery. She didn’t enjoy the prestige, as the Secretary did, and she seemed bizarrely overworked for the proxy boss of a project in its pilot stage.","remains a mystery to this day, but one thing was certain - her tenure was marked by a trail of frustrated colleagues and unfinished tasks, as if her very presence",56,"remains a mystery to this day, but one thing was certain - her tenure was marked by a trail of frustrated colleagues and unfinished tasks, as if her very presence seemed to suck the productivity out of the room.

Despite her polished resume and impressive credentials, Adela's people skills were severely lacking, and it was only a matter of time before her attitude caught up with her."
"Graham put down his mug.

The sound of the coffee shop faded into the background, and all that was left was the gentle hum of the espresso machine and the soft rustle of Graham's breathing. It was as if time itself had slowed down, allowing us to savor this fleeting instant, this spark of connection that seemed to hold the promise of something more."
"Graham blew smoke out through his nose reflectively. “I see,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s fair to call him ‘grim,’ though you wouldn’t be the","first to say it.

"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders. The bridges kept turning in their core reports, and the experiments kept running.

I was worried that his refusal to adapt would be a form of hubris, a challenge to the universe to prove him wrong, and that the universe, in its infinite wisdom, would take him up on that challenge. And so, I tried to reason with him, to explain to him that the twenty-first century was not all bad, that there were still moments of beauty and wonder to be found in it, but he just laughed and told me that I was naive, that I was drinking the Kool-Aid, that I was a pawn in a much larger game. And I didn't know what to say to that, because a part of me wondered if he was right, if I was just a fool for thinking that things could be different."

As I stood there, I could feel the weight of my responsibilities slowly lifting, like the steam rising from the tub, and I couldn't help but smile at the simple pleasure of the moment."
"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century. On ships there were cooks and officers’ stewards; at home, on the few occasions he was at home, there were women. Nevertheless, he had taken to cooking in a way he had failed to take to","television or texting or the use of deodorants (“I bathe every day,” he’d said to me with hurt dignity). Tonight, he hummed with a busyness that hardly shielded nervousness. He burned the onions and automatically reached for his cigarettes.

Graham's culinary skills had improved dramatically since his arrival, thanks in large part to the patient guidance of his colleague, Dr. Sophia Patel. She had taken him under her wing, teaching him the fundamentals of cooking and introducing him to a world of flavors and ingredients he never knew existed. As he chopped, sautéed, and seasoned his way through the kitchen, Graham felt a sense of calm wash over him, a feeling that was all too rare in his line of work. The sizzle of onions and the aroma of freshly baked bread were a balm to his frazzled nerves, and he found himself looking forward to his time in the kitchen as a much-needed escape. And so, as he stood at the stove, stirring the pot of stew that would be his dinner, Graham felt a sense of contentment wash over him, a feeling that was both familiar and foreign, like a warm hug from an old friend."
Margaret was wearing high-waisted cerulean bell-bottoms and a white blouse clocked with lace. She looked like a disco,"goddess, an astonishing concoction given that she was only barely older than the piano, never mind the synth.","queen from another era, and the way she moved with the music, her hips swaying and her arms waving in the air,",36,"queen from another era, and the way she moved with the music, her hips swaying and her arms waving in the air, only added to the illusion.

As she spun and twirled, her bell-bottoms flared out around her, shimmering like the surface of a tropical ocean, and her white blouse seemed to glow with an otherworldly light, as if it were infused with the magic of the disco era. The crowd around her seemed to fade into the background, and all that was left was the music, the lights, and Margaret, lost in the rhythm and the moment, a true child of the disco age."
"Arthur was happy and flushed. He was one of those unusual extroverts who have all the attributes of an introvert, save that they like being around other people.

His eyes sparkled with warmth as he moved through the crowded room, his smile effortlessly drawing people to him like a magnet. Despite his outgoing nature, Arthur was also a deep thinker, often lost in thought as he pondered the mysteries of life and the human condition. This unique blend of traits made him a compelling and empathetic listener, and people from all walks of life were drawn to his compassionate and non-judgmental ear. As he navigated the room, Arthur's presence seemed to have a profound effect on those around him, calming the anxious, uplifting the downtrodden, and inspiring the uninspired. His was a gift that went far beyond mere charm or charisma – it was a profound and abiding connection to the hearts of those he met."

"Margaret, incidentally, listened to the men talk about their careers with a suffused urgency that only I noticed. In her own era, she’d slept in the room next to the one where she had been born.","She thought Scotland was far-flung and semi-barbaric. When we came round to talking about my time working as a translator in Cambodia, I felt her attention all over me.

As she listened, she couldn't help but think of her own life, and the ways in which she had been shaped by the stories of those who had come before her. The men's words were like a whispered secret, a reminder of the fragility and beauty of human connection in a world that seemed increasingly fragmented and disjointed."
"How the topic of weed came up I couldn’t remember—probably during one of the vigorous debates about what the twenty-first century had genuinely improved, which in",the opinion of the expats was a mixed bag.

But somehow, amidst all the back-and-forth, someone had brought up the topic of weed, and now it seemed to be the focal point of our conversation. I vaguely recalled someone mentioning the recent legalization in several states, and how it had become a sort of cultural phenomenon, with dispensaries popping up on every corner and cannabis-infused everything being sold online. The group had been debating the merits of it all, with some arguing that it was a harmless way to unwind, while others claimed it was a gateway to harder substances. I had zoned out for a bit, lost in my own thoughts, but now I found myself tuning back in, curious to see where the conversation would go from here."
"Meeting Margaret made me vivid and receptive. Sentences weighed more. I kept a half-conscious catalog of where the men were looking. I’ve seen people deal with this in different ways. By “this,” I mean power. I mean magnetism. I try to absorb it.

Was it her beauty, her intelligence, or something more intangible? Whatever it was, I was determined to learn from her, to absorb some of that magnetism for myself, and to understand the secrets behind her effortless charm."
"“Such matters are between myself and God,” he said gravely. “Oh, stop frowning, Sixty-five.","Arthur, will you please lead her in a polka, if you can still stand.”",You look as if you have lost your last marble.

"“In this age, musicians are imprinted inside music boxes, and there is no need for the band to","keep time,” said Margaret. “You will instruct me in the polka, or I will step on your toes.”","be physically present to play their instruments, as the music boxes can produce the same sounds",36,"be physically present to play their instruments, as the music boxes can produce the same sounds with perfect fidelity, allowing people to enjoy their favorite tunes in the comfort of their own homes, or even on the go, without the need for live performances."

He spun me, and I was, with such satisfaction, spun.","a flower, my back arched and my arms extended, and he spun me",24,"a flower, my back arched and my arms extended, and he spun me around with a gentle yet firm hand, the music swirling around us like a vortex of sound and color."
"As soon as she stepped in, I started making a tally of the evidence of unbeauty. There was a chair whose seat was filled with clothes too dirty for the wardrobe but too clean for the washing basket. My bedside table sprouted two water glasses and a mug. Dust crouched on the skirting boards and in the seams of","my chest of drawers. When a woman is as impossibly attractive as Margaret, the mediocrity shed by a woman like me bustles around her like a horde of pigeons. Or so I thought, at that time.

I watched as she navigated this landscape of neglect, her eyes scanning the room with a mixture of curiosity and trepidation. She paused at the window, where the curtains hung limp and faded, filtering the sunlight into a dull haze that struggled to penetrate the gloom. The silence between us was oppressive, punctuated only by the creaks and groans of the old house, which seemed to be shifting and settling around us like a living, breathing entity. As she turned to face me, I could see the faintest glimmer of a question in her eyes, a question that seemed to ask: how did it come to this?"
Margaret appeared unaware of any of these concerns. She didn’t even glance at herself,in the mirror. She gave me an interested grin as I pulled out my lipsticks.,"in the mirror that hung on the wall, her attention solely focused on the old,",29,"in the mirror that hung on the wall, her attention solely focused on the old, leather-bound book lying open on the small, cluttered desk in front of her."

She looked at me with a curious expression, and I could tell she was thinking about the implications of this strange, new substance. ""What is this made of?"" she asked, and I launched into an explanation of the ingredients and the process of creating it. As I spoke, I realized that I had been taking this technology for granted, and it was interesting to see it through Margaret's eyes. She was fascinated by the way it could change the appearance of the skin, and she asked me if I thought it could be used for other purposes.

It was a woman, her face pinched with worry, and her eyes red-rimmed from lack of sleep. She moved quietly to Margaret's side and gently shook her awake, whispering something in her ear. Margaret stirred, yawned, and sat up, rubbing her eyes, and the woman handed her a small, folded piece of paper. Margaret's eyes scanned the contents, and her face went white. She looked up at the woman, then at me, and I could see the fear and uncertainty etched on her face."
"All the expats had phones, paid for (and tapped) by the Ministry. Graham had switched his own phone on a total of three times in the seven","months he had been in the twenty-first century. I was therefore unsurprised when, about half an hour after their plane landed, I got a call from Arthur’s phone.","months he'd been in the country, and only then to make a few, brief, and pointedly non-sensitive calls.

As a result, he was surprised when the phone suddenly buzzed to life in his hand, shrill in the quiet of the hotel lobby. He glanced around, feeling a flicker of unease, before answering in a low voice."
"Arthur was striding up the street, bent slightly against a wind which didn’t exist. He was wearing a tweed jacket and looked like a period piece,","but then again, so did Pimlico.

He was a man on a mission, driven by a sense of purpose that he couldn't quite explain, even to himself. The streets seemed to stretch on forever, a never-ending labyrinth that he navigated with a sense of detachment, his feet carrying him forward on autopilot as his mind wrestled with the questions that had been plaguing him for weeks."

I raised an eyebrow, intrigued, and she continued, ""I've been going over the accounts in my head, and I think I've found a way for us to make ends meet after all.""

"Adela was of the “never been to the GP in my life because I’m not a pussy” school of care, and nothing changed.

Adela's approach to health was simple: if it wasn't broken, don't fix it, and if it was broken, it would probably heal on its own with a bit of rest and some TLC. This philosophy had served her well so far, and she saw no reason to change it now, even in the face of the expats' constant worrying and hand-wringing about their various ailments."
"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs.

According to the analyst's notes, Graham's responses to questions about sex were characterized by a ""marked ambivalence"" and a tendency to "" intellectualize"" the subject. He seemed to view sex as a relic of a bygone era, a quaint and somewhat distasteful custom that had been rendered obsolete by the advances of modern technology. The analyst had noted that Graham's attitudes towards sex were ""curiously Victorian,"" and had speculated that his upbringing in a strict, fundamentalist household may have contributed to his prudishness. I couldn't help but wonder, as I read through the report, whether Graham's aversion to sex was a result of his upbringing, or if it was simply a manifestation of his own unique personality. Whatever the reason, it was clear that sex was a subject that made Graham deeply uncomfortable, and I found myself wondering if he would ever be able to overcome his inhibitions and engage in a normal, healthy sex life. As I pondered this question, I couldn't help but think back to our own awkward encounters, and the way that Graham's reserve had made me feel like a clumsy, overeager suitor. I had to admit, I was curious to see how things would develop between us, and whether Graham would ever be able to reconcile his desire for intimacy with his deep-seated aversion to sex."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory.

But as I gazed into her eyes, I caught a flicker of something else, a spark of curiosity that hinted at a depth beyond her years. It was a reminder that even the most seemingly blank of slates can hold secrets and surprises, and that the true power of knowledge lies not in its possession, but in its exchange."
Graham was adamant about not informing the Ministry about his illness. It was the closest I had,ever seen him to entreating. I thought about it a lot. I liked being entreated by him.,"ever come to seeing him so vulnerable, and it stirred up a mix of emotions within me -",34,"ever come to seeing him so vulnerable, and it stirred up a mix of emotions within me - concern for his well-being, fear of the unknown, and a deep-seated loyalty to keep his secret safe, no matter the cost.

"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled.

But even as I sprang into action, I couldn't help but wonder what secrets Adela was hiding, and what the true nature of our mission was."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.","that a man could be so utterly convinced of his own righteousness, yet so catastrophically wrong.

I sighed inwardly, wondering how someone so intelligent could be so obtuse. ""Graham, you have to consider the context,"" I began, but he cut me off, his voice rising in defensiveness."
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.","his lips, and a look of deep contemplation on his face.

The room was filled with the savory aromas of roasting meat and baking bread, and my stomach growled in anticipation of the meal to come. As I hung my coat and hat on the rack, Graham looked up and caught my eye, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. ""I've got a surprise for you,"" he said, his voice low and mysterious, and I felt a thrill of excitement run through me. I walked over to the table and sat down beside him, and he pushed a small, exquisitely carved wooden box towards me. ""What is it?"" I asked, my curiosity piqued, and Graham just chuckled and said, ""Open it and see."" I lifted the lid, and a faint scent of sandalwood wafted out, carrying with it memories of far-off lands and exotic spices. Inside, nestled in a bed of black velvet, lay a small, glittering gemstone, its facets glinting in the soft light of the evening. I gasped in wonder, and Graham's smile grew wider, his eyes sparkling with pleasure. ""I found it in a little shop in the city,"" he said, his voice full of excitement. ""I knew you'd love it."" And as I gazed at the gemstone, feeling its smooth, cool surface and marveling at its beauty, I knew that this was going to be a night to remember."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers. He took in anecdotes about my childhood meals as if they would contribute to a portrait of a whole woman. He ignored the fact that mostly I cooked assorted chicken pieces on rice. I could tell him things about galangal, and he found that very profound.","equipment, his eyes narrowing as he tried to pinpoint the exact balance of spices.

I began to look forward to these culinary interrogations, and soon found myself experimenting with new recipes, eager to see if I could recreate the complex flavors of my childhood. Graham's fascination with Southeast Asian food became a common ground for us, a way for us to connect beyond our shared work on the transmission project. As we sat down to eat, the smell of sizzling meat and steaming vegetables filled the air, transporting me back to my family's dinner table. Graham would listen intently as I described the different dishes, his face lighting up with excitement whenever I mentioned a new ingredient or cooking technique. Our conversations about food became a way for us to bond, to share stories and laughter, and to momentarily forget about the challenges of our work. And as the days turned into weeks, I found myself feeling a sense of belonging, of being part of a community that went beyond the confines of our research facility."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization. I wanted him in a role that didn’t require him to be at sea for months, possibly years,","at a time. It was too soon, I told myself.

I knew that I had to be strong, for his sake as well as mine, but the fear of being apart was always lurking in the back of my mind. We spent hours poring over job listings, searching for something that would be a good fit for him, something that would allow him to use his skills and experience, but also keep him close to home. It wasn't easy, but eventually, we found a few possibilities that seemed promising. There was a job at a local maritime museum, one that would allow him to share his knowledge and passion with others, and another at a company that specialized in marine conservation. Both options seemed like a good fit, but I knew that the decision ultimately rested with him. I just hoped that he would choose the path that would bring him the most happiness, and keep him safe."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.","The upbeat melody clashed with the tense atmosphere in the room, but Graham didn't seem to notice, too engrossed in the conversation to adjust the music.

His guest, however, couldn't help but tap their foot along to the infectious beat, a subtle smile creeping onto their face as they listened to the familiar lyrics. The contrast between the music and the conversation's tone was jarring, but it also seemed to be having an unexpected effect, slowly chipping away at the tension that had been building. As the song reached its climax, Graham's guest leaned forward, their eyes locked intently on his, and said something that made his expression change from one of curiosity to one of surprise."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes. One of his first searches was charmingly housewifely: “Most challenging recipes”; “How to make cheese soufflé”; “What is miso paste?”; “Where to buy miso paste”; “How long has Japan been open to Europe?” A day or so after I’d read this report, I received another that listed the following search terms:","and that his online activities would be the source of a scandal that would ruin my career and possibly even land me in jail.

I envisioned the headlines: ""Minister's Aide Embroiled in Sex Scandal,"" ""Government Official's Husband Caught in Online Indiscretions."" I could already see the looks on my colleagues' faces, the whispered conversations in the hallways, the pointed fingers. My mind was racing with worst-case scenarios, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was on the verge of a disaster. I tried to push the thoughts aside, focusing on my work and the tasks at hand, but my mind kept wandering back to Graham and his newfound love of the internet. What was he doing online? Was he really as innocent as he seemed, or was he hiding something from me? The not knowing was eating away at me, and I couldn't help but wonder if I was married to a man with a secret life."
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing,","as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday. This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option. We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit. Still, we had not told them about the death camps.","but to me it just looked like a lot of people getting very wet and trying to protect their homes from the rising water.

It was still open, despite the chaos outside, and the owner, Mrs. Jenkins, was serving hot tea and coffee to the people who had gathered there to wait out the storm. I joined the crowd, grateful for the warmth and the chance to catch my breath. As I sipped my tea, I couldn't help but think about how quickly things had changed. Just a few hours ago, the sun had been shining and the streets had been dry. Now, the whole town was underwater and people were struggling to cope. I wondered how long it would take for things to return to normal, and what other surprises the day might hold. The café was a small island of calm in the midst of the chaos, and I was grateful to be there, surrounded by the familiar faces of my neighbors and friends. As I looked around, I saw Mrs. Jenkins' husband, John, trying to fix a broken sandbag, and the Watsons' kids, playing with a ball of soggy paper in the corner. It was a strange and surreal scene, but it was also strangely comforting. We were all in this together, and as long as we had each other, we could face whatever the storm threw our way."

"Adela’s voice contracted on that last sentence. She wiped her gaze, concentrated in her one working eye, up and down my face, to see if I’d noticed, and continued, “Our first priority","is protecting the expats and the time-door.

Her voice was firm but laced with a hint of concern, and I could sense the weight of responsibility she felt in keeping me safe. As she spoke, she expertly guided me through the winding corridors, her eyes scanning the surroundings with a mixture of caution and urgency."

"Anne Spencer almost made it off those wards. After I read the email, an ancient and exuberant terror blazed through me.

And now, as I read the words on the screen, I felt that terror rising up again, threatening to consume me whole. I thought of all the times Anne and I had talked about this very scenario, about the what-ifs and the maybes, and how we had always managed to push the thoughts away, to convince ourselves that it wouldn't happen to us. But now, it seemed, it had. I felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead as I read the words again, my mind racing with questions and fears and worst-case scenarios. How could this have happened? Was she okay? Was she...? I couldn't even bear to think the word, couldn't bear to consider the possibility that Anne might be gone, that I might never see her bright smile or hear her infectious laugh again."

My eyes darted towards the door, my only hope for escape, but as I took a step towards it, I heard a faint rustling sound coming from the direction of Rogue Male. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest, as I wondered if I was really alone in the room."
