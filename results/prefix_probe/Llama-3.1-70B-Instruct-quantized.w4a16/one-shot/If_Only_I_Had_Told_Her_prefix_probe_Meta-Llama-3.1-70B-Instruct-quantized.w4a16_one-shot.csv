I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that,"we were crashing at my house, and I felt it was my duty to be the one to take the blows.","he was trying to get a rise out of her, and I wasn't about to let that happen. Autumn can",41,"he was trying to get a rise out of her, and I wasn't about to let that happen. Autumn can be a bit of a hothead, and Jack knows exactly which buttons to press to get under her skin. I've seen it before, and I wasn't going to stand by and watch it happen again. So, I made sure to keep a close eye on them, ready to intervene if things started to escalate. It was a tense moment, but thankfully, my presence seemed to diffuse the situation, and we were able to move on without any further incident."
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.","Autumn—started talking about how they wanted to go on a camping trip together.

They had been planning it for months, but something always came up, and they never got around to actually doing it. This time, however, they were determined to make it happen. They spent hours poring over maps and guides, trying to find the perfect spot to set up their tent. Jack was adamant that they should go to the mountains, while Autumn was pushing for a trip to the beach. In the end, they decided to compromise and settle on a secluded lake in the woods, surrounded by tall trees and abundant wildlife. The more they talked about it, the more excited they became, and before long, they had convinced me to join them on their adventure."
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.","My mind, however, is a different story altogether, as it immediately begins to conjure up",36,"My mind, however, is a different story altogether, as it immediately begins to conjure up worst-case scenarios, each one more disastrous than the last, and I can feel my heart sinking with every passing moment, the sound of Jack's footsteps echoing through the room like a death knell, until he finally speaks, his voice low and husky, sending shivers down my spine as he says, ""Hey, I brought coffee."""
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,"to stir, and I can tell he's trying to get up, but I hold out a hand to stop him.

You need to rest,"" I say firmly, trying to keep my voice down. I turn back to the figure in the tent, my heart racing with a mix of fear and uncertainty. The person inside is still and silent, and I can feel Jack's eyes on me, waiting for an explanation. I take a deep breath and try to think of what to say, but before I can come up with anything, the figure in the tent starts to move, slowly sitting up and looking around in confusion."
"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with","the word “type.” Autumn makes a noise in the tent, and we both hold our breaths and listen.","e word ""again.""

""What's going on, Sam?"" he asks, his voice a little stronger now. ""Why are we...?"" He trails off, looking around the room as if hoping to find some answers. I take a deep breath and try to explain, but before I can get the words out, Jack's gaze lands on something behind me and his expression changes. ""Oh no,"" he whispers, and I turn to see what's caught his attention."
"“Zoned out the way she does? You have been so, so…","Like last week!” Jack asks, “How could you have missed that game?”","preoccupied lately, I'm starting to get worried that something's going",23,"preoccupied lately, I'm starting to get worried that something's going on and you're not telling me, is everything okay?"

I open my mouth.","smile that always makes my heart skip a beat, I feel a flutter in",29,"smile that always makes my heart skip a beat, I feel a flutter in my chest and my mind goes blank for a moment, as if the world around us has melted away, leaving only the two of us standing there, suspended in time."
"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke. Surely the school administrators knew we had always been together, were meant to be together. Surely, if I looked around the cafeteria, she would be there?","together was a small price to pay for the freedom to make new friends.

Jack was one of the first people I met in my first-period class, and we quickly discovered a shared love of video games and science fiction novels. We spent our lunch breaks exploring the school and getting to know each other, and by the end of the first week, we were inseparable. As the months went by, Jack became more than just a friend – he was a confidant, a partner in crime, and a constant source of support. We navigated the ups and downs of middle school together, from navigating the complexities of social cliques to dealing with the pressures of standardized tests. And through it all, our friendship only grew stronger, a bond forged in the fires of adolescence that would last a lifetime."
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time. I didn’t sit down because I recognized Jack though; I simply sat at the first empty seat, defeated. But Jack remembered me. He asked me if I ever watched pro soccer.

As I sat down, he flashed me a quick smile and pushed a chair out with his foot, gesturing for me to take a seat. The cafeteria was starting to fill up with the lunch crowd, but we were still early enough to grab a relatively quiet spot. Jack leaned back in his chair, eyeing me with a curious expression, and I wondered what was on his mind. We had never really talked one-on-one before, and I wasn't sure what to expect. ""Hey, how's it going?"" he asked, his voice low and relaxed, and I shrugged, feeling a bit self-conscious. ""It's going,"" I replied, trying to sound casual, and Jack chuckled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. ""That's deep,"" he said, and I laughed, feeling a bit more at ease. We sat there for a moment, the only sound the clinking of dishes and the murmur of conversation from the other tables, and I realized that I was actually starting to enjoy myself. Jack seemed to sense it too, because he leaned forward, his expression turning serious. ""So, what's your story?"" he asked, his eyes locked on mine, and I felt a flutter in my chest as I wondered where this conversation was going to go."
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.","Autumn's eyes sparkled with amusement as she replied, ""Hi, Jack.""

The air was filled with an awkward silence as Jack struggled to process the changes in Autumn's appearance. I could sense his confusion and surprise, but Autumn seemed to take it in stride, her smile never wavering. She walked towards us, her movements fluid and confident, and Jack's eyes followed her, his expression a mixture of fascination and discomfort. I felt a pang of anxiety, worried about how Jack would react to Autumn's new form, but Autumn seemed to sense my unease and reached out to reassure me with a gentle touch on the arm. ""It's okay,"" she said, her voice soft and melodious, ""I'm still the same person."" Jack's eyes snapped back to mine, and I could see the questions swirling in his mind, but before he could ask any of them, Autumn continued, ""So, Jack, what brings you here today?"" Her tone was light and casual, and Jack seemed to relax a little, his shoulders easing down from their defensive hunch. He launched into a story about his latest project, and Autumn listened intently, her eyes sparkling with interest. As they talked, I watched Jack's initial shock give way to curiosity, and eventually, to a sense of wonder. It was clear that Autumn's transformation had not diminished her charm, and Jack was quickly becoming entranced by her new presence."
"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face. He didn’t believe that Autumn was—or ever had been—my friend. The daughter of my mom’s best friend, who was around a lot? Sure.

As I watched him walk up the path to his front door, I couldn't shake the feeling that our friendship was about to change in ways I couldn't yet imagine. The drive back to my place was quiet, with only the sound of the engine and the occasional passing car breaking the silence. I was lost in thought, replaying the events of the night and wondering what the future held for us. When I finally pulled into my driveway, I sat in the car for a few moments, collecting my thoughts before getting out and heading inside. The house was dark and empty, a stark contrast to the chaos and noise of the night before. I wandered aimlessly from room to room, trying to clear my head and make sense of everything that had happened. But the more I thought about it, the more my mind seemed to spin in circles, unable to grasp the reality of the situation. I eventually collapsed onto the couch, exhausted and emotionally drained, and let the darkness wash over me."
"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.","adorned the walls, and the scent of pumpkin spice wafted through the air, a constant reminder of the season I had grown to adore.

I took him on hayrides, to apple orchards, and on long walks through the crunching leaves, determined to show him the beauty of Autumn. And as the days turned into weeks, I could see the change in him, the way his eyes would light up at the sight of a crimson maple, the way he'd smile at the taste of a warm apple cider. He was starting to see Autumn through my eyes, and I knew I had succeeded in my mission. But little did I know, Autumn had one more surprise in store for us, one that would change everything."
"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still","friends. On the last day of school before winter break, Jack finally said something. I cannot remember what I had been telling him, only that it had been about Autumn.","friends, and that our friendship was not a casualty of the events that had transpired.

As I stood there, trying to convince him of something I wasn't even sure I believed myself, I couldn't help but wonder if Autumn felt the same way. Had she moved on, or was she still holding onto the memories of our time together? I thought back to the last time we spoke, the way she had looked at me with a mix of sadness and longing in her eyes. It was a look that had haunted me ever since, and one that I couldn't shake no matter how hard I tried. I knew I had to see her again, to talk to her and clear the air once and for all. But as I turned to leave, I couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation. What if she didn't want to see me? What if she had moved on and I was just a relic of her past? The thought sent a pang of anxiety through my chest, but I knew I had to try. I had to know for sure where I stood with Autumn, and I had to know now."
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah? Let’s take this outside,” and hurried me out.","to start yelling at us, but instead he just shook his head and muttered something under his breath.

As we made our way out onto the field, the tension was palpable. The opposing team was already warming up, their coach barking orders at them. I couldn't help but feel a sense of dread wash over me as we took our positions. What was going on with Jack, and how was it going to affect our game?"
"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind","yourself, ‘Autumn is where she wants to be right now, and that’s okay. I’m still great, and I’ll be around if she needs me.’ Hmm?” She squeezed my foot again.","yourself of all the things that make you happy and special, and try not to let the mean things people say get to you.

You are so much more than what they say you are. You are kind, smart, and talented, and don't let anyone ever make you feel otherwise. Now, how about we make a plan to do something fun this weekend, just the two of us? Maybe we can go to the park or get ice cream? What do you say?"
"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly.

I decided to focus on that and see where it would take me. As I continued to play, I started to notice improvements in my overall fitness and agility, which in turn helped me to become a better player. I also began to appreciate the mental aspect of the game, the strategy and teamwork involved, and how it required a different kind of coolness, one that was more about being calm under pressure and working together with my teammates towards a common goal. This newfound appreciation for the game helped me to stay motivated and focused, and I found that I was able to apply the same principles to other areas of my life, becoming more confident and self-assured in the process."
"Jack and I had worried one of us might not make it on the junior varsity team. When the lists were posted,","I searched for my name on the JV list and was devastated to not see it. Still, I was happy for Jack.","we were both relieved to see our names side by side, a testament to the countless hours of sweat and",44,"we were both relieved to see our names side by side, a testament to the countless hours of sweat and hard work we had put in over the summer.

I couldn't help but feel a surge of determination and excitement at the prospect of taking our skills to the next level. Little did we know, this was only the beginning of an incredible journey that would push us to our limits and forge an unbreakable bond between us."
"Jack told me later that my ability to brush off the snarky comment from that junior, my new teammate,",made me seem cool. There had been chuckles of appreciation according to him.

"The varsity soccer team practiced on the north field, near the student parking lots. The junior varsity team practiced on the south field, closer to the circular drive where parents dropped off and picked","up kids. Even though Jack and I were on different teams, our schedules were still the same, and my mom would drive us to and from practice every day for those last weeks of summer.","up and dropped off their children.

The varsity team, consisting of the school's most skilled players, was led by Coach Thompson, a no-nonsense veteran of the sport who had been leading the team to victory for over a decade. In contrast, the junior varsity team was comprised of younger, less experienced players who were still honing their skills under the guidance of Coach Lee, a younger and more laid-back coach who focused on developing the players' technique and teamwork. Despite their differences, both teams shared a common goal: to make it to the state championships and bring home the coveted title. As the sun began to set on another day of practice, the teams packed up their gear and headed off to their respective locker rooms, already looking forward to the next day's challenge."
"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me. I was excited to tell him that practice hadn’t been as hard as I thought.,"that I was going to walk home, which was only about a mile away.

I thought about the upcoming season and all the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead, and I felt a sense of excitement and anticipation building inside me. As I approached my front door, I felt a sense of pride and satisfaction, knowing that I had taken the first step towards a new chapter in my life."
"We all joined Jack on the low wall, waiting to get picked up. We didn’t talk that much, but the next day, as I trudged from the north field to","the south, I saw the girls by the gym door again.

I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized that whatever was in that package was going to change things, and I wasn't sure if I was ready for it. The others began to gather around, sensing that something was about to happen, and Jack slowly stood up, the package clutched tightly in his hand. The air was thick with anticipation as we all waited for him to reveal what was inside, our minds racing with possibilities. And then, just as Jack was about to open the package, we heard the sound of a car engine in the distance, growing louder with each passing second."

What if she had tried to speak, but the words caught in her throat as she struggled to process the emotions swirling inside her? What if she had finally found her voice, and whispered my name, and I had turned to her, my face a mask of calm, but my eyes burning with a fire that threatened to consume us both?"
"It strikes me how backward my plan sounds: give up a girl who adores me, who I love well enough, to be a disciple for a different girl who will","never fall for me.

She shrugs, a small, careless movement that makes my anger spike. ""I just couldn't watch you two together anymore,"" she says, her voice dripping with malice. ""You were so happy, so in love. It was nauseating."" Her words are like a slap in the face, and I feel my eyes sting with tears. I thought we were friends, I thought we had a bond that went deeper than this. But now I realize I was wrong, that our friendship was just a facade, a way for her to get close to me, to manipulate me. I feel a wave of sadness wash over me, but it's quickly replaced by anger, by a desire to lash out at her, to hurt her the way she's hurt me. But I don't. I just stand there, frozen, as she turns and walks away, leaving me to pick up the pieces of my shattered heart."

It was a feeling she had never experienced before, and one that she would never forget."
“I don’t like him.” I shrugged. “I told you before: Autumn’s an old friend from when we were kids. Sucks that she,"likes such a show-off.” I shrugged again.

I just wish she'd see him for what he really is and leave him already."
My face must change because she smiles and clambers into my lap. We wrap our arms around each other and settle in.,"After a moment, she says, “You know, I never thought this would happen either.

"“Yeah,” I admit. Jack was protecting me, but there’s no way he believed that I was over Autumn.

All I know is that I'm stuck in this limbo, trying to navigate my feelings for both of them, and it's tearing me apart. I look over at Jack, who's still watching me with an intensity that makes my skin prickle, and I wonder what he's thinking.

I look around, taking in the rows of sleek, silver machines and the soft glow of computer screens. It's all so familiar, yet somehow alien. My parents lead me to a small room in the back, where a woman with a kind face and a warm smile is waiting for us. She introduces herself as Dr. Lee, and begins to explain the procedure, her words tumbling out in a soothing stream. I listen intently, trying to absorb every detail, but my mind keeps wandering back to the unknown, to the secrets that lie beyond the doors of this mysterious place."

He tried to laugh it off, but I could see the hurt in his eyes. It was like she was constantly trying to drive a wedge between him and the rest of us. And the worst part was, Stella seemed to be going along with it, like she was being manipulated by their mother's behavior. I felt so sorry for him, but at the same time, I was also angry that he didn't stand up for himself more. It was like he was just accepting of being treated this way, and that was hard for me to understand. As the years went by, I watched their relationship continue to deteriorate, and it was like a slow-motion train wreck that you couldn't look away from. You knew it was going to end badly, but you couldn't help but watch."

As we wait for our main courses to arrive, John and I make small talk, discussing everything from the weather to our jobs. I learn that he's a financial analyst, and I find myself zoning out as he launches into a detailed explanation of the current market trends. I try to feign interest, but my mind starts to wander, and I find myself glancing around the restaurant, taking in the other patrons. There's a couple on a date, giggling and holding hands, and a group of rowdy businessmen in the corner, clinking glasses and shouting. The atmosphere is lively, but I feel a sense of disconnection, as if I'm observing it all from outside my body. Before I know it, the waitress returns with our steaks and lobster, and the smell of sizzling meat and butter wafts up, snapping me back to reality. I dig in, savoring the flavors and textures, and for a moment, everything else fades away."

""And I've also been researching some of the local legends and myths, to see if we can find any connections between them and the stories people are sharing."" I smile, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment at the progress we're making. ""Great work, Jack,"" I say. ""Let's keep at it. I have a feeling that we're on the verge of uncovering something really special here."""

I reassured him that the doctors were taking good care of our little one and that we would get through this together as a family. We talked for a bit longer, and I could feel the weight of his emotions, even over the phone. After we hung up, I took a deep breath and tried to process everything that was happening. The baby's diagnosis had turned our world upside down, but in that moment, I felt a sense of determination wash over me – we would face this challenge head-on, and our love for each other and for our daughter would carry us through."

His face lights up, and tears of joy well up in his eyes as he reaches out to take my hand, his grip tight with emotion. In this moment, everything else fades away, and all that matters is the little miracle growing inside me, and the love we share as we embark on this new chapter in our lives."

The door creaked open, and I was surprised to see that it wasn't Emily who answered, but a man I had never seen before. He was tall, with a scruffy beard and a curious expression on his face. 'Can I help you?' he asked, eyeing the umbrella in my hand. I explained the situation, and he nodded thoughtfully. 'I think you'd better come in,' he said, stepping aside to let me enter. As I walked into the house, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The air inside was thick with an eerie silence, and I could sense that something was waiting for me, just out of sight."
