"They approached the altar positioned at the edge of the cliff and gazed out at the dramatic view of the Kona coastline just as the sun was dipping into the ocean. Gopal Das (Brimmer and May/Groton/Williams/UC Berkeley/Four Winds Shaman School), a tall, lanky Caucasian",man in his midforties with shoulder-length strawberry-blond hair and a matching beard stretched out his densely freckled arms in a godlike manner. “Let us welcome this blessed sunset.

The sound of his voice was like nothing they had ever heard before - it was as if the wind and the waves and the earth itself were singing in harmony. As he reached the climax of his chant, the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the landscape. The group stood in awed silence, feeling the energy of the moment wash over them. Suddenly, a gentle breeze picked up, carrying the sweet scent of plumeria through the air, and the group felt a deep sense of peace and tranquility settle over them. It was as if the ritual had awakened something deep within them, something that connected them to the land, to the universe, and to each other. As they stood there, bathed in the fading light of day, they knew that this was a moment they would never forget, a moment that would stay with them long after they left this magical place behind."
"Gopal Das tucked the tight white tee that showed off his sinewy pecs into his camo-green cargo shorts and said, “Close your eyes. Now breathe","in deeply…. Let your first chakra connect with the ground, rooting in the earth, connecting with Gaia, connecting with spirit. Now, what do you feel?”","deeply.

Gopal Das's eyes sparkled with excitement as he shouldered his backpack and set off along the winding trail, the dense foliage of the forest closing in around them like a vibrant, green tunnel. The air was thick with the scent of blooming flowers and the earthy smell of damp soil, and the sound of birdsong filled the air, a melodic accompaniment to their journey."

How can you be so calm after what we just saw? I swear, sometimes I don't even know how you can be so reckless and impulsive. We could have been killed, and you're just standing there, smiling like it was some kind of amusement park ride. I don't know whether to be amazed or appalled by your nonchalance."
*3 Although “cottage” could be rather misleading for the spacious four-bedroom house with a thatched roof,"that was decomposing so perfectly, Thomas was constantly finding DIY influencers taking selfies by the garden gate.","that stood on the outskirts of the village, it was a term that had stuck since the original, much smaller dwelling had",33,"that stood on the outskirts of the village, it was a term that had stuck since the original, much smaller dwelling had been built centuries ago, and locals still referred to it by that name, even though the current structure was a far cry from the humble abode it once was, with its beautifully manicured gardens and a babbling brook running along its edge, creating a serene and idyllic atmosphere that was a perfect haven for the family who called it home."
"*4 Though Arabella was raised speaking the Queen’s English in what was then the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong and spoke with the poshest of accents, whenever she came into contact with other Asians—particularly","family members and service people—her accent would take on the inflections and sentence structuring that were peculiar to upper-crust Hong Kongers.

It was as if her mind was a repository of linguistic and cultural nuances, and being around others who shared her heritage unlocked a part of her that she rarely accessed in her daily life. This phenomenon was not unique to Arabella, of course; many people who have grown up in multicultural environments can attest to the experience of code-switching, where they seamlessly transition between different languages, accents, and even identities. But for Arabella, this ability to navigate multiple cultural spheres was both a blessing and a curse, a constant reminder of the complex and often fraught nature of her own identity."
"“That’s because I’m the only one around here who eats carbs,” Eden said as she took","a bite of her chocolate croissant, still warm from the oven. “You really ought to try one.”","a large bite of her sandwich, the crunch of the crust and the softness of the bread a welcome",33,"a large bite of her sandwich, the crunch of the crust and the softness of the bread a welcome respite from the protein-heavy meals that dominated the cafeteria's menu, a quirk that often led to good-natured teasing from her friends and colleagues, who couldn't fathom why anyone would willingly indulge in something as ""basic"" as a sandwich when there were far more exotic options available."
"Suddenly Arabella’s eyes lit up and she seemed to recover slightly. “Yes, she will be good","for OS, won’t she? Eden, you’ll offer your assistance, won’t you, in our time of need?”","for you, I am sure of it,” she said, her voice a little stronger now. “She has a kind heart,",32,"for you, I am sure of it,” she said, her voice a little stronger now. “She has a kind heart, that one. I have seen the way she looks at you, with a deep affection in her eyes. You must be gentle with her, though - she is fragile, like a flower that blooms only in the warmest of sunlight.”"

"“The older woman said, ‘Excuse me, do you speak English?’ I was used to this question, so I simply nodded. The younger woman said, ‘We see you here every day. You’re so good with the baby. She clearly adores you.’ ‘Thank you,’ I replied. And then","the older woman leaned over and whispered, ‘Whatever they’re paying you, we’ll double it.’ I was so confused, and then it hit me: These women think I’m the nanny!

The younger woman pulled out a piece of paper and a pen from her bag and started writing down their contact information. 'We're usually busy on weekdays, but we need someone to watch the baby on weekends. Would that work for you?' I nodded eagerly, still trying to process the unexpected turn of events. As we exchanged numbers and made plans, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and responsibility. Little did I know, this chance encounter would lead to a life-changing experience."
"Arabella credits her own mother for her confidence to upend centuries of tradition. “My mother grew up in Shanghai, which was the Paris of the East, so for her, Asian Fusion wasn’t a fad, it was a way of life.” Arabella’s barrister father","hailed from one of Hong Kong’s most respected legal families. “People are constantly surprised to learn that I didn’t grow up in a rice paddy.

As a result, Arabella developed a strong sense of self and a willingness to take risks, which ultimately led her to pursue a career in the culinary arts. Her parents' influence can be seen in the eclectic menu at her restaurant, which seamlessly blends traditional Asian flavors with modern twists and ingredients. The dishes are a testament to Arabella's heritage and her ability to balance seemingly disparate elements into something entirely new and innovative. By combining the familiar with the unexpected, Arabella has created a unique dining experience that is both a reflection of her roots and a bold step forward into the future of cuisine."
"The countess never imagined that her modern spin on Marco Polo would spawn her own design and hospitality empire, but after a famously finicky Qatari prince spent the weekend and was wowed by the countess’s hospitality, he commanded her to design a hotel in London “for people who can only bear to stay in palaces when they travel,” promising to book out","the entire place every year for the London Season. Arabella quickly conceived of Bella’s, the gemlike London oasis that has set the standard for boutique establishments everywhere.

She spent months scouring the globe for the finest materials and craftsmen, from the intricate marble mosaics of Italian artisans to the plush silk fabrics of French weavers. As the hotel began to take shape, the countess's vision for a modern-day palace began to materialize, with lavish suites, opulent public spaces, and even a private cinema and spa. And when the prince finally arrived for his month-long stay, he was so impressed with the countess's creation that he extended his booking for another month, and then another, cementing the hotel's reputation as the go-to destination for discerning travelers from around the world."

"Eden awoke to the sound of unfamiliar chirps. The chorus of birds outside sounded more spirited than anything she’d heard before, and they had been at it all night. Having arrived very late the previous","evening to a house at the end of a pitch-black road, she had no inkling of what lay outside.

Now, as she slowly opened her eyes to the bright sunlight streaming through the window, the morning melody was almost deafening. She lay in bed for a moment, trying to shake off the remnants of sleep and get her bearings. The room was simple, with cream-colored walls and a patchwork quilt that seemed to have been lovingly stitched together. A small wooden dresser stood against one wall, adorned with a vase containing a single, delicate wildflower. Eden's gaze lingered on the flower, and she felt a sense of peace wash over her. She had been drawn to this place for a reason, and as she swung her legs over the side of the bed, she felt a thrill of excitement at the prospect of exploring her new surroundings. The birds, it seemed, were just the beginning of a whole new world waiting to be discovered."

A faint rustling in the underbrush caught her attention, and she froze, her senses on high alert as she waited to see what would emerge from the thicket."

“Why? Are you going to the Wolseley? Look how I’m dressed.” Rufus gestured to his tattered board shorts and bare feet as they cut through a wooded path that led from the beach to a road that to Eden seemed straight out of a dream. Tall coconut,"palms, fragrant hibiscus bushes, and mango trees lined the winding lane of relaxed old bungalows and wooden beach cottages next door to the occasional sprawling mansion. Rufus reached up into one of the low-hanging branches as they walked past and plucked two ripe mangoes. “For breakfast.” He grinned.","trees towered above them, their slender trunks swaying gently in the breeze as the sound of the waves grew fainter.

The air was thick with the scent of frangipani and hibiscus, and Eden felt as though she had stepped into a different world. Rufus, seemingly oblivious to the beauty around them, continued to chat about the Wolseley, a restaurant that was apparently a favorite among the locals. As they walked, the trees gave way to a small village, with colorful buildings and bustling streets that seemed to pulse with a vibrant energy. Eden's eyes widened as she took in the sights and sounds, feeling a sense of excitement and wonder that she hadn't experienced in a long time. Rufus, noticing her gaze, grinned and said, ""Welcome to our little slice of paradise, Eden. I think you're going to like it here."" And with that, he led her into the heart of the village, where the sounds of laughter and music filled the air, and the smell of delicious food wafted from the restaurants, making Eden's stomach growl with hunger."
"“Puako Beach Road is one of the only places left on the entire island that still has these original cottages from the sixties right on the beach,” Rufus","explained. “It’s a real neighborhood, as opposed to some poncy resort. You love hunting down the local hangouts whenever you travel, so I thought you’d prefer it over here.”","explained, his eyes scanning the horizon as if searching for a glimpse of the past. “They're a reminder of a simpler time, before the high-rise resorts and luxury condos took",57,"explained, his eyes scanning the horizon as if searching for a glimpse of the past. “They're a reminder of a simpler time, before the high-rise resorts and luxury condos took over. It's a piece of old Hawaii that's slowly disappearing.” He paused, his voice filled with a mix of nostalgia and concern. “That's why it's so important to preserve these cottages, to keep the character of the island intact.” As he spoke, a gentle breeze rustled the palm trees, and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore created a soothing melody that seemed to underscore the importance of preserving this slice of paradise."
Rufus gestured outside. On one end of the back deck was an outdoor shower nestled between thick tropical bushes and a,wall of stacked volcanic rocks. Rufus pointed to a galvanized steel cistern on the roof. “That tank collects rainwater for the shower.”,"large palm tree, its trunk wrapped in a thick layer of ivy, the leaves of which had begun to curl up the wooden slats of the shower's exterior",43,"large palm tree, its trunk wrapped in a thick layer of ivy, the leaves of which had begun to curl up the wooden slats of the shower's exterior wall. The sound of the water cascading down created a soothing melody that seemed to blend in harmony with the chirping of the birds and the rustling of the leaves in the gentle breeze. As Rufus stepped under the cool water, he felt the tension in his muscles begin to ease, the warm sun on his skin a stark contrast to the cool water that rained down on him. The sensation was almost therapeutic, and for a moment, he forgot about the reason he had come to this place, forgot about the stress and the anxiety that had been weighing him down. All that mattered was the present, the feeling of the water on his skin, and the peace that came with it."
"“Now, you and I both know that Rufus is wasting his life away",in Hawaii.

Arabella nodded. “She is one of the hottest emerging artists around. She already has important galleries in,"London, Paris, and LA, and everyone’s flipping her work, so she can satisfy all of Rufus’s artistic pretensions.”","New York and London clamoring for her work, and her last show in Los Angeles was a huge success.

"“Not only is she to the manor born, she is to the hotel born too!” Bea jumped in. “The de Courcys own a fabulous crop of hotels all over",France and the French Caribbean.

After all, she's been groomed for this role her entire life, and I'm sure she'll make her family proud. The question is, will she be able to bring some much-needed modernity to the business, or will she stick to the traditional ways of her ancestors?"
They went outside to the wooden deck and sat down on a pair of canvas butterfly chairs. Eden,"inhaled the steam from her coffee mug, which was infused with a sweet scent. “Did you add vanilla?”","sat with her back to the railing, her eyes fixed on the dark shape of the island, while Jack settled",36,"sat with her back to the railing, her eyes fixed on the dark shape of the island, while Jack settled into the chair beside her, his eyes fixed on her profile.

Jack was the first to speak, his voice low and gentle, ""You're really something, you know that?"" Eden turned to him, a hint of a smile playing on her lips, ""What do you mean?"" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. Jack leaned forward, his eyes locked on hers, ""I mean, you're not like anyone I've ever met before,"" he said, his words hanging in the air like a challenge."
"“Mmm. Love it.” Eden smiled as she took a long, slow sip, closed her eyes, and eased into her chair. The sun on her face","felt so lovely, she could hardly believe that it was the middle of winter back in Britain. “Now I feel like I’m truly on holiday.”","felt warm and comforting, and the sound of the birds chirping in the nearby trees added to the serene atmosphere.

The coffee shop was her happy place, where she could escape the chaos of her daily life and just be. She took another sip, savoring the rich flavor, and let her mind wander to all the things she wanted to accomplish in the coming weeks.

"No you’re not, Eden thought to herself as she sipped on her coffee, taking in the sounds of the waves","pounding onto the lava rocks and the ecstatic screech of birds. “I’ve never heard birds quite like this before,” she said.","crashing against the shore, the salty air filling her lungs as she sat on the beach, watching the sun rise over the horizon,",41,"crashing against the shore, the salty air filling her lungs as she sat on the beach, watching the sun rise over the horizon, its golden hues casting a warm glow over the entire scene, a sense of peace washing over her as she felt the stress of the past few weeks slowly melt away, the sound of the waves and the cries of seagulls creating a soothing melody that seemed to lull the world into a serene slumber, and for a moment, Eden felt like she was the only person in the world, the coffee in her cup a warm comfort that seemed to complete the perfect morning, a morning that she wished could last forever."

The music swelled, and she lost herself in the magic of the night, her worries about what to wear now a distant memory."

""Yeah, I'm fine,"" she lied, trying to shake off the feeling of unease that had settled in the pit of her stomach. But as she glanced at the phone, still clutched in her friend's hand, she couldn't help but feel a sense of dread wash over her. How much longer could she keep this up?"

"No sooner had Rufus said this than a now-familiar roar filled the air and Freddy’s fantastical boat pulled up to the dock. As everyone climbed on board, a pair of dark-tinted glass doors automatically opened, revealing a sleek, Zenlike interior cabin where Freddy (CEE/Crossroads/NYU/Pepperdine), dressed in a pale beige cashmere sweater over a white","linen shirt and pleated linen trousers, lounged like a pasha on plush white cashmere cushions.

As the passengers settled in, Freddy took his place at the helm, his eyes flicking between the various controls and readouts with the practiced air of a seasoned pilot. With a soft hum, the boat began to move, gliding smoothly away from the dock and out into the open water. The sun was beginning to set, casting a warm golden light over the waves as Freddy expertly navigated the vessel through the choppy surf. As they picked up speed, the wind whipping through their hair, the group couldn't help but feel a sense of exhilaration and freedom. Where were they headed? Only Freddy knew, and he wasn't telling – at least, not yet. For now, they were content to simply enjoy the ride, the thrum of the engines and the rush of the wind combining to create a sense of weightlessness and joy. As the stars began to twinkle in the night sky, Freddy finally spoke up, his voice low and mysterious. ""We're almost there,"" he said, his eyes glinting with a hint of mischief. ""Just a little farther..."" And with that, the boat surged forward, leaving the group to wonder what wonders – or dangers – lay ahead."
"Laurel (Balboa/Thacher/Cornell/MIT) winced. “We’re not hunting whales, Mr. Farman-Farmihian. Not today or any other day.

With a deep breath, he pushed open the massive wooden doors and stepped inside, his eyes adjusting slowly to the dim light within.

"The dream was always the same. She was six, maybe seven years old.

As she grew older, the dream began to fade, but the memory of it remained, a bittersweet reminder of the bond she shared with her mother. Even now, as an adult, Eden couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness whenever she thought about that dream, and the longing it stirred up within her. She often found herself wondering what her life would be like if her mother were still there, if she could turn back time and join her on that walk to the supermarket. The what-ifs swirled in her mind, a constant reminder of the choices she didn't make, and the life she didn't have.
