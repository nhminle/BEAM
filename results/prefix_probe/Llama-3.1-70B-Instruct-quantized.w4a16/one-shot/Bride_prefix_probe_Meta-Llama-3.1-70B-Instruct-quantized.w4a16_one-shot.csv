"Not quite the stuff of childhood dreams. Then again, I’m no dreamer. I only ever contemplated marriage once, back in the gloomy days of my childhood. Following a few too-harsh punishments and a","poorly executed assassination attempt, Serena and I concocted plans for a grand escape, which was going to involve pyrotechnics-based diversions, stealing our math tutor’s car, and flipping off our caregivers in the rearview mirror.","particularly brutal beating, I recall lying in bed, praying fervently for a fairy-tale rescue.

I envisioned a dashing prince, arriving just in time to sweep me off my feet and transport me to a world of happiness and tranquility. But as the years went by, reality set in, and I came to realize that such fantasies were nothing more than a desperate attempt to escape the hardships of my life. My focus shifted from romantic daydreams to the harsh realities of survival, and I learned to rely solely on myself for protection and comfort. The idea of marriage, once a distant hope, gradually faded into the background, replaced by the daily struggles of growing up in a world that seemed determined to break me. Yet, as I grew older, I began to realize that the notion of marriage wasn't entirely lost on me. It was just that my perception of it had changed, influenced by the harsh realities of my life and the people I had encountered along the way."
"That was fourteen years ago, though, and Serena never married me. In fact, she’s long gone. I’m here alone, with a giant heap of","expensive wedding favors that’ll hopefully fool guests into overlooking the lack of love, genetic compatibility, or even previous acquaintance between me and the groom.","unpaid bills, a dwindling bank account, and a lingering sense of regret that I've never been able to shake.

The memories of our time together still linger, a bittersweet reminder of what could have been. I often find myself wondering what would have happened if she had stayed, if we had worked through our differences and built a life together. But life has a way of moving on, and I've been left to pick up the pieces of a dream that never came to fruition. The silence is deafening at times, a constant reminder of the emptiness that fills my days. I've tried to move on, to fill the void with work and hobbies, but nothing seems to fill the gap that Serena left behind. I'm left to wander these empty halls, haunted by the ghosts of what could have been."
I did try to arrange a meeting. Suggested to my people that they suggest to his people that we could grab lunch the week before the ceremony. Coffee the previous day. A glass of tap water the morning of—anything to avoid a “How do you do?” in front of the officiant. My request,"was escalated to the Vampyre council, and resulted in a phone call from one of the members’ aides.

I figured we'd just have to wing it on the big day. After all, how hard could it be to pretend to be in love in front of a few hundred people? I was about to find out."
"One of the agents stops us in front of the double doors that lead into the courtyard. “Councilman Lark, Miss Lark, one minute. They’re not quite ready for you.” We","wait side by side for a handful of uncomfortable moments, then Father turns to me. In my stylist-mandated heels, I nearly reach his height, and his eyes easily catch mine.","exchange a look, and I can tell we're both thinking the same thing: this is it.

I can feel my palms growing sweaty and my legs trembling beneath my dress. Councilman Lark, on the other hand, seems completely composed. He gives me a reassuring smile and nods at the agent. ""Very well,"" he says. ""We'll wait."" The agent nods and steps aside, allowing us to wait in front of the doors. I glance around, taking in the opulent decorations and the stern-faced guards standing at attention. It's hard to believe that in just a few minutes, our lives could be changed forever."

"The first things I notice are the two walls of windows, which is exactly what Father wants. Every Human I’ve talked with assumes that Vampyres hate light and relish darkness, but they couldn’t be more wrong. The sun may be forbidden to us, toxic always and deathly in large quantities, but that’s precisely why","we covet it with such intensity.

Father's design for our home is a testament to this paradox. The walls of windows, which stretch from the polished marble floor to the vaulted ceiling, are a deliberate attempt to capture the sun's splendor, to bottle its luminescence and preserve it for our own private enjoyment. As I step further into the room, I notice the way the light pours in, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the floor, a dazzling display of oranges, yellows, and pinks. It's almost as if the sun itself has been invited into our midst, its presence both a comfort and a reminder of the world we can never truly be a part of. I feel a pang of melancholy at this thought, but it's quickly dispelled by the sound of Father's voice, calling out to me from the far corner of the room."
"“Whose? Yours? Are you going to . . .” I don’t bother finishing the sentence—the sheer thought is ludicrous. It’s not just weddings that have gone out of fashion hundreds of years ago, but the entire idea","of long-term relationships. As it turns out, when your species sucks at producing children, encouraging sexual walkabouts and the search for reproductively compatible partners takes precedence over romance. I doubt Vampyres were ever particularly romantic, anyway. “Whose?”","of romantic love and commitment as we once knew it.

The world has moved on, and the concept of marriage has become a relic of the past, a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era. I shake my head, chuckling at the absurdity of the idea, and turn my attention back to the task at hand."

"“You hold a Human child as a deterrent for ten years, with the mutual understanding that if the Humans","violate the terms of our alliance, the Vampyres will instantly murder the child.

Despite the circumstances of her captivity, Aria has grown to love her caretaker, a kind and gentle being named Zorvath, who has taught her the ways of our people and the secrets of the universe. But as the tenth year of her captivity draws to a close, Aria begins to feel the weight of her destiny, and the choice that will soon be hers to make: to remain with the only family she has ever known, or to return to a planet and a people she has never known, and claim her rightful place as a leader among them."
"He nods. “A little more than a week ago, her little brother, Abel, turned fifteen. That night, he and three friends were out partying, and found themselves near the river.

But as they swam, a strong current swept Abel away from the others, and despite their frantic cries for help, he was pulled under the water and disappeared. The search party found his body the next morning, tangled in a mess of branches and debris near the river's edge. The news of Abel's death sent shockwaves through the small community, and his family was consumed by grief.

The question is, which side will emerge victorious, and what will be the cost of their triumph?"
"I only ever laughed out loud with Serena, which means that it must have been well over a month since I last did","it.

"Serena was like that, too, when I first met her. “So crucifixes burn you?” she asked me a couple of weeks","into our cohabitation, after I failed to convince her that the viscous red liquid I kept in my fridge was tomato juice.","after we'd met, her eyes sparkling with mischief as she leaned in close, her breath a whisper against my ear.

As they try to soothe their children, they exchange a brief, knowing glance, a glance that speaks volumes about the challenges and complexities of their lives as mothers of supernatural creatures. The Vampyre's eyes flicker with a hint of worry, while the Were's eyes seem to hold a deep understanding, a sense of solidarity that only comes from sharing a unique experience.

And yet I still remember it, that first churning twist in my stomach when Serena didn’t","turn up to my place for laundry night. Didn’t reply to my texts. Didn’t pick up the phone. Didn’t call in sick to work, and simply stopped showing up. It felt a lot like fear.","come home that night, the first time I had to sit across from my parents and explain why my best friend was lying in a hospital bed, her body broken and battered beyond recognition.",69,"come home that night, the first time I had to sit across from my parents and explain why my best friend was lying in a hospital bed, her body broken and battered beyond recognition. It was a feeling that would become all too familiar in the years to come, but at the time, it was a sensation that shook me to my core. I recall the way my mother's eyes seemed to bore into mine, as if searching for any sign of guilt or complicity, while my father's face remained a mask of stoic concern. The police came and went, asking their questions and taking their statements, but I knew that I would never be able to shake the memory of that night, the night that changed everything. Even now, I can still feel the weight of it, the way it settled into my bones like a chill that refuses to thaw."
"“A few days? She still wouldn’t let the little asshole starve,” I hurried to add, but the officer had already dropped his pen. And even though I went back to the station three times that week, and eventually managed to get a missing person report filed, no one did anything","to find Serena. The hazard, I guess, of being alone in the world: no one to care that she was safe, and healthy, and alive. No one but me, and I didn’t count. I shouldn’t have been surprised, and I wasn’t. But apparently I still had the capacity to feel hurt.","about it. The police didn't send out a search party, they didn't put up posters, they didn't even bother to ask me any follow-up questions.

I was starting to lose hope, wondering if I would ever see her again. The thought of her being out there, alone and scared, was eating away at me. I felt helpless, like I was the only one who truly cared about her disappearance. I began to wonder if anyone would even notice if I disappeared too. The feeling of being ignored and dismissed by the authorities was infuriating, and I couldn't shake the feeling that they were hiding something from me. I decided to take matters into my own hands, to start my own investigation, no matter how futile it may seem. I started by retracing her last steps, talking to people she knew, and searching for any clues that might lead me to her. I was determined to find my sister, no matter what it took."
"Because no one cared whether I was safe, or healthy, or alive. No one but Serena. The sister of my heart,","if not of my blood.

"I had the keys, after all. Because the key to everything is but a line of code. I was able to rifle through her bank statements, IP addresses, cell phone locations. Herald emails, metadata, app usage. Serena was a journalist, one who","wrote about delicate financial stuff, and the most likely option was that she’d gotten embroiled in something fishy while working on a story, but I wasn’t going to exclude other possibilities. So I went through everything, and found . . . nothing.","had a knack for uncovering secrets, but it seemed she had a few of her own.

I found a trail of encrypted messages, hidden behind a VPN, that led me to a mysterious contact known only by their handle 'Echo-1.' The messages were innocuous enough, discussing everything from the latest news to their favorite books, but the fact that Serena had gone to such great lengths to conceal them piqued my interest. I decided to dig deeper, following the digital breadcrumbs to a small café on the outskirts of town. It was a place I had never been before, but something about it seemed familiar. As I sat down at a table, I noticed a figure in the corner, hood up and face obscured. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched, and I wondered if I had just stumbled into something much bigger than I had initially thought. The barista, a friendly woman with a warm smile, came over to take my order, and I asked her if she knew anything about the mysterious figure. She leaned in close and whispered, 'You're not the first person to ask about them. They've been coming in here for weeks, always sitting in the corner, always wearing that hood. Some folks say they're a whistleblower, others a hacker. But one thing's for sure, they're trouble.' I thanked her for the warning, but my curiosity was already getting the better of me. I decided to approach the figure, to see if I could uncover the truth behind the mysterious messages and the secrecy surrounding Serena's life. As I walked over, the figure slowly stood up, its movements deliberate and calculated. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, and I wondered what I was getting myself into."
"And that’s when I did it: I kneeled in front of Serena’s damn fucking cat. He was playing like he always did after dinner, pawing at a crumpled receipt in a corner of the living room, but managed to squeeze a couple of hisses into his busy schedule just for me. “Listen.” I swallowed. Rubbed my","hand on my chest and then even slapped it, trying to dull the ache. “I know you only knew her for a few days, but I really, really . . .” I scrunched my eyes shut. Oh fuck, this was hard. “I don’t know how it happened, but I think that Serena might be . . .”","hands together, trying to warm them up, and then reached out to the cat.

But I'm trying to change that. I want to make things right between us."" The cat looked up at me, his ears perked up slightly, and for a moment, I thought I saw a glimmer of understanding in his eyes. I continued, my voice shaking slightly. ""I know I've been a terrible person, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the way I've treated you, and for the way I've treated Serena. I'm trying to be better, I really am."" The cat blinked at me, and then looked away, but I could sense a slight relaxation in his posture. I took it as a sign that maybe, just maybe, I was on the right track."

"Or maybe not quite. A distant bell rang, reminding me of a game Serena and I used to play as kids, a primitive substitution cipher we made up to gossip freely in front of our caregivers. We’d named it the butterfly alphabet, and","it mostly consisted of adding b- and f- syllables to normal words. Nothing complicated: even rusty as I was, it took my brain only a few seconds to untangle it. And once I was done, I had something.

I felt a pang of nostalgia, remembering the countless hours Serena and I had spent encoding and decoding messages, our minds racing with the thrill of secrecy. The butterfly alphabet had been our own private language, a way for us to communicate without fear of being overheard or understood. As I stood there, lost in the past, I couldn't help but wonder if Serena had ever thought of it too, and if she had, what she might be trying to say to me now. The bell rang again, louder this time, and I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized that maybe, just maybe, I was being summoned to a game of butterfly alphabet, one that would unravel the mysteries of the past and lead me to the truth."
"I didn’t scream, or cry, or attack that old hag. I was paralyzed, unable to function properly for the rest of the night, and only started processing what had happened when I","got home and told Serena, who was furious on my behalf and demanded a promise from the caregiver on shift: that I would never be forced to attend a similar function again.","walked into school the next day, the fluorescent lights overhead seeming to hum in sync with the anxious buzzing in my head.

I couldn't concentrate on anything my teachers were saying, my mind replaying the events of the previous night like a broken record. The image of her twisted face, the sound of her voice, it all lingered, refusing to be shaken off. I felt like I was living in a nightmare, and I couldn't wake up. As I sat in class, I caught glimpses of my classmates chatting and laughing, completely oblivious to the turmoil brewing inside me. I wondered if anyone would believe me if I told them what had happened, or if they would just think I was crazy. The uncertainty was suffocating, making it hard for me to breathe. I just wanted to go back to my normal life, but I knew things would never be the same again."

I sigh, feeling a mix of emotions swirling inside me. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that I'm married, that I've committed to spending the rest of my life with someone. It's a daunting thought, but at the same time, it's exhilarating. I think back to the ceremony, to the way my heart skipped a beat when I saw my husband walking towards me. I remember the way he smiled, the way his eyes crinkled at the corners. I feel a flutter in my chest as I think about the future, about all the memories we'll make together. I look down at the ring again, feeling a sense of wonder and excitement. This is just the beginning of our journey together, and I'm eager to see what the future holds."

""It's a classic."" I hesitated, unsure of what to expect, but Serena's enthusiasm was infectious, and soon I found myself sampling the various dishes, marveling at the complexity of human flavors and textures. It was a strange, disorienting experience, but also strangely exhilarating, like a door had been opened to a whole new world of possibilities."

I find myself wondering what his story is, what brings him to this place, and what's troubling him so deeply. Is he running from something, or someone? Or is he searching for something, or someone?
