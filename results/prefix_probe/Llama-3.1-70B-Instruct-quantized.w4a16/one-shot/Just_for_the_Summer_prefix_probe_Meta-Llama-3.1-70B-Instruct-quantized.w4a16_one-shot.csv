I [29m] have been friends with Chad [32m] since we were born.

As kids, we were inseparable, and our friendship only deepened as we entered adulthood. We went to different colleges, but we remained close, often meeting up during breaks and sharing stories about our lives. Chad was more than just a friend to me; he was a brother, a confidant, and a partner in crime. We had our fair share of wild adventures, from road trips to music festivals, and through it all, our bond remained unbreakable. Even as we entered our thirties, our friendship continued to evolve, with Chad becoming a source of support and guidance as I navigated the ups and downs of life."
"Anyway, forward to five months ago. I dated Hope [28f] for a few weeks. Not a big deal. We decided we weren’t feeling it, no chemistry, so we called it quits. And then lo and behold she hits","it off with Chad. Of course in true Good Luck Charm fashion, this means Chad is her soulmate. Chad is all googly-eyed over her, they’ve met the parents, they’re ring shopping—and they want to move in together. Immediately.","me up on social media a month later, asking if I wanted to grab coffee and catch up. I agreed, thinking it would be nice to part on good terms and maybe even remain friends.

I agreed, thinking it would be nice to part on good terms and maybe even remain friends. We met up, had a nice conversation, and I thought that was the end of it. But then she started texting me regularly, asking for advice on various things and sharing stories about her life. I was happy to help and chat with her, but I didn't think much of it, assuming she just needed someone to talk to. That was until she started making comments about how much she missed me and how she regretted ending things between us. I tried to brush it off, thinking she was just being friendly, but it soon became clear that she was developing feelings for me again. I didn't feel the same way, but I didn't want to hurt her, so I tried to let her down easy. I told her I valued our friendship, but I didn't think we were compatible in a romantic way. I thought that would be the end of it, but she kept pushing, asking me to reconsider and telling me that she couldn't stop thinking about me. It got to the point where I had to be blunt with her and tell her that I wasn't interested. I felt bad for hurting her, but I thought that was the end of it. But then she started showing up at my favorite coffee shop, ""coincidentally"" bumping into me, and making awkward small talk. I began to feel uncomfortable and even a little scared, wondering if she was stalking me. I tried to avoid her, but she kept finding ways to ""run into"" me. I'm not sure what to do at this point, as I don't want to be mean to her, but I also need to protect my own boundaries and well-being."
"The only problem is that Chad has six more months on our lease but found a perfect new house for him and Hope, and he can’t afford to pay rent on two places at the same",time. So he had to make the difficult decision to screw me over or screw her over—and he picked me. Now I have to find a way to cover his rent until the lease is up.,"time.

He's been trying to find someone to take over the lease, but so far, no one has been willing to commit. I've been helping him post ads on social media and local classifieds, but it's been tough. We're starting to get a little worried that we'll be stuck with a vacant room and a hefty rent bill. Chad and Hope are really excited about their new place, and I'm happy for them, but I'm also going to miss having them around. We've had some great times together, and it's going to be weird not having them here. I just hope we can find someone to take over the lease soon, so we can all move on with our lives."
"I’m annoyed, but I decided to try to find a reason to spend more time outside so I don’t have to stare out my window. I’ve always wanted a dog, but Chad would never agree to it. So I went to a rescue and found the ugliest animal there. The one so hideous, nobody else wanted it. This dog’s got an underbite and mange, and he’s missing half an","ear. He’s a little Brussels Griffon, so he’s got that deep frown—he looks like a judgmental gremlin. I adopted him and named him Chad since the dog is now my new best friend. If you’re reading this, you’re dead to me, human Chad. (Not really, I still love the guy.) But I tag him in the captions of every Chad the Dog Instagram post with “Look, a loyal Chad!”","ear, but he's got the biggest personality I've ever seen.

At first, Chad was furious, but Rocky's charm eventually won him over too. Now, Rocky and I spend hours exploring the neighborhood, and I've even started a little garden in our backyard. It's amazing how much joy this little ball of fur has brought into my life. I still get annoyed with the view from my window, but with Rocky by my side, I don't mind it as much. In fact, I've started to appreciate the little things, like watching the sunset with my new furry friend. We've become quite the local celebrities, with people stopping to pet Rocky and comment on his unique appearance. I've even started a little Instagram account for him, and he's gained a surprising following. Who knew that a rescue dog with an underbite and mange could bring so much happiness into my life? As I look back, I realize that getting Rocky was the best decision I ever made, and I'm grateful for that annoying view from my window that prompted me to take the leap."
I tilted my head so my braid fell to one side and held up four fingers. Maddy,"didn’t look happy, but she took the picture with my phone, then handed it back to me.","raised an eyebrow, her eyes flicking to my hand before she nodded and held up three fingers",34,"raised an eyebrow, her eyes flicking to my hand before she nodded and held up three fingers in response, a silent understanding passing between us as we stood there, the tension in the air momentarily broken by our wordless exchange."
"“That dog trusts him,” Maddy said. “And that’s a rescue dog, so that means something. They’re usually all","skittish and freaked out.” She went quiet again looking at his wall. “Go down further,” Maddy said. “The billboard.”","skittish around new people, but that dog is practically leaning against him. I think we can trust him too.” Maddy's words",37,"skittish around new people, but that dog is practically leaning against him. I think we can trust him too.” Maddy's words were reassuring, but Emily couldn't shake off the feeling that there was something more to this stranger than met the eye. As they walked towards him, Emily noticed the way the dog's tail wagged lazily, its eyes fixed adoringly on the man. It was clear that the dog had found a kindred spirit, but Emily's instincts were still on high alert. She glanced at Maddy, who was smiling warmly at the stranger, and wondered if her friend was being too hasty in her judgment."
That night after work Maddy made dinner. Grilled portobello mushrooms and rice pilaf. I did,"the dishes and cleaned the kitchen, then took a shower and blew out my hair.","the dishes, and we sat down to eat together, the soft hum of the evening news",30,"the dishes, and we sat down to eat together, the soft hum of the evening news in the background, a comforting routine that felt like a warm hug after a long day.

"“Sorry, I had to give Brad his dewormer. I brought some for",you too. Faith said you’ve been dragging your ass on the carpet?”,"you too, just in case. I know it's not the most pleasant experience,",24,"you too, just in case. I know it's not the most pleasant experience, but it's necessary to keep you healthy and happy. Here, let me just give you this treat to make it easier to swallow."
My best friend was in a Hawaiian shirt and pink cargo shorts. He was a general manager at Trader Joe’s. I missed not having to go to the grocery store now,"that he had moved out. Actually, I missed a lot of things now that Brad had moved out. Like having another human to talk to, even if it was this one.","because my friend would bring me all the Two Buck Chuck and Speculoos Cookie Butter I could ever want.

He was a great friend, but I was starting to think he was more of a great enabler. I mean, who needs that much Speculoos? But still, it was nice to have someone to hang out with, even if he was a bit of a goofball. We spent our days lounging on the couch, watching TV, and eating Cheetos. It was a pretty sweet deal, but I knew it couldn't last forever. Eventually, I'd have to get a job and start contributing to society again. But for now, I was just going to enjoy the ride and the endless supply of Speculoos."
"“This is true,” Brad said, looking at his phone. “We are",assholes. But only to each other. It’s the foundation of our friendship.”,"currently running about 20 minutes behind schedule, and if we don't leave",23,"currently running about 20 minutes behind schedule, and if we don't leave now, we'll miss the opening act of the concert."
"Brad nodded at me. “You know, if she’s got the same thing you do,","if you guys date each other, you’ll both find your soulmates when you break up.”","there's a good chance she'll be able to help you figure out what's going on. I mean,",29,"there's a good chance she'll be able to help you figure out what's going on.

We don't know what we're dealing with here, and I don't want you to get hurt.”"
They were starting to do the couples thing for all the trips and birthdays. They were all going up,"to Lutsen in October to go hiking. They asked me if I wanted to go, but I didn’t. Not alone.","to the mountains for a weekend, and then they were going to start taking vacations together,",39,"to the mountains for a weekend, and then they were going to start taking vacations together, and eventually, they would all be going to each other's weddings and having kids around the same time, and their friendships would evolve into a lifelong support system, a network of people who had known each other through all the ups and downs of life, and who would be there to offer a shoulder to cry on, or a celebratory drink, whenever it was needed."
Brad took a swallow of his drink. “Ask that nurse out. Go,"wherever she is. Pitch the idea to her, she might be into it.”","on, ask her out. What's the worst that could happen? She says no",25,"on, ask her out. What's the worst that could happen? She says no and you're in the same position you are now. But what if she says yes? You never know, you might just find yourself falling for her. Besides, you've got nothing to lose, right? You're already stuck in this hospital bed, so what's a little rejection going to hurt? Just do it, Brad, take a chance. You can't let fear hold you back, not now, not when you've got a second chance at life."
"“Yeah,” Brad said. “She dates you, you guys break up, and she rides happily into the sunset too. It’s a win-win. Seriously. This is your chance.",If you don’t do something you’re gonna spend the rest of your life sending women on to their forever families and never getting one for you.”,"to get back at her, to show her that you're not just some guy she can use and discard.

You're not the same guy you were back then, and I'm pretty sure you can come out on top this time around. So, what do you say? Are you in?"
Brad looked me in the eye. “You will never find someone as long as all the women you date aren’t actually meant for you. You’re not their,soulmate. Their soulmate is the person they meet after you. It’s decided the minute it starts. They are literally fated not to be The One. Think about it.”,"type, and they're not yours either.

You're just a stepping stone for them, a temporary distraction from whatever it is they're really looking for. And you're doing the same to them, using them to fill a void that you don't even know how to define. You need to take a step back and figure out what you want, what you're really looking for in a partner, before you can find someone who's truly meant for you. Otherwise, you'll just keep repeating the same pattern, and you'll end up alone, wondering why you can't seem to find anyone who truly gets you. Brad's words cut deep, but I knew he was right. I had been using dating as a way to avoid dealing with my own issues, and it was time for me to take a hard look at myself and figure out what I really wanted."
"I had actually thought about her. I’d checked once or twice to see if she’d messaged me again. She hadn’t. The last message was me telling her it was nice chatting with her, three days ago. Trying to keep talking to her was a dead end if she","lived somewhere else. But I don’t know. Maybe Brad had a point. What could it hurt to try?

But my mind kept wandering back to her, wondering what had happened and why she had suddenly stopped responding. Had I said something wrong? Had she lost interest? The questions swirled in my head, refusing to be silenced. I sighed and rubbed my temples, trying to shake off the frustration. It was just a casual conversation, after all. It wasn't like I had invested my heart and soul into it. Yet, the silence from her end still stung, leaving me with a nagging sense of uncertainty."
I already knew what he did for a living because Maddy had cyberstalked,"him. Of course I couldn’t tell him that, so I had to ask questions.",him on social media and told me all about his job as a freelance graphic,27,"him on social media and told me all about his job as a freelance graphic designer, but I had never met him in person before, so I wasn't sure what to expect from our encounter."

"For a moment I debated calling from a blocked number. He was nice, but I still didn’t know him. But I figured it",was just as easy to block him later if he got creepy.

As the phone rang, I couldn't help but think about how this conversation could go either way - he could be understanding and we could move forward, or he could be annoyed and that would be the end of it. The ringing stopped and he picked up, his voice cheerful as he said hello, and I launched into my explanation, trying to gauge his reaction from the tone of his responses."
“But what if it isn’t? I’m just playing devil’s advocate here. What if it isn’t? Brad said that everyone I’m serious enough to date more than twice is cosmically destined for someone else.” He went quiet for,"a beat. “Does nobody feel right to you?

His words hung in the air, and for a moment, it seemed like the entire world had come to a standstill, waiting for a response. The weight of his question settled heavily on her shoulders, and she felt the need to reassure him, to tell him that their connection was real, that they were meant to be together, no matter what the universe had in store for them. But as she looked into his eyes, she saw a glimmer of doubt, a spark of uncertainty that made her wonder if he was right. Was she just a placeholder, a temporary distraction from the person he was truly meant to be with? The thought sent a shiver down her spine, and she knew she had to find a way to convince him, to convince herself, that their love was strong enough to overcome any cosmic destiny."
"“Look,” he said. “I know the idea’s a little out there. But if this is actually a thing, we’re in a pretty low-risk/high-reward situation. We’d just have to hang out a few times and","then stop. That’s it.

I've done some research, and there are people out there who are willing to pay top dollar for this kind of thing. Of course, it's all very hush-hush, but I think it's worth a shot. We can always back out if things start to get too weird. What do you say? Are you in?"

This time, the silence was oppressive, weighing on me like a physical force. I found myself wandering the streets, scanning the crowds for a glimpse of her bright pink hair, my heart racing with every false sighting. I knew I had to do something, but what? The police wouldn't listen, and I had no idea where to start looking. All I could do was wait, and hope that Amber would come back to me before it was too late."

"When my mother was at her best, you could meet her and walk away thinking you’d been in","the presence of a Muse or an angel.

"Maddy’s moms were my foster parents. They’d wanted to be my real parents, but it just never felt right. I had a mom. And I was fourteen when they got me. The imprinting didn’t take.

I turned around to see what had caught his attention, and that's when I saw her - a girl with piercing green eyes and long, curly brown hair, laughing and chatting with a group of kids from our school. She looked familiar, but I couldn't quite place her. Alex, noticing my interest, raised an eyebrow and mouthed ""new student"" before turning back to his friends. I felt a sudden surge of curiosity and made a mental note to find out more about this mysterious girl."

NO.”","knew that something was wrong, her gaze narrowing as she took in the sight of the cracked",35,"knew that something was wrong, her gaze narrowing as she took in the sight of the cracked screen and the dark, unresponsive display, a look of alarm spreading across her face as she took a step closer to me."
"As we started pulling our bags from the trunk, a brown-haired middle-aged woman came out of",the side of the three-car garage. “Are you Emma?” she said in a thick Mexican accent.,"the house, a look of curiosity on her face, and approached us with a warm, friendly smile,",32,"the house, a look of curiosity on her face, and approached us with a warm, friendly smile, her eyes crinkling at the corners as she asked if we were the ones who had come to rent the cottage for the summer."

They can probably see it from space.”,"find any answers here, but I suppose it’s worth a shot,”",20,"find any answers here, but I suppose it’s worth a shot,” she said, her eyes scanning the dusty, cobweb-covered shelves that lined the walls of the old antique shop, the air thick with the scent of decay and forgotten memories."
Maddy must have been thinking the same thing I was. “Does it rain a,"lot in Minnesota?” she asked, raising her voice over the sound of the old motor.","lot here?” she asked, her eyes scanning the dry, cracked earth and the withered plants",29,"lot here?” she asked, her eyes scanning the dry, cracked earth and the withered plants that lined the deserted road. I shook my head, feeling a sense of unease wash over me as I gazed out at the desolate landscape. The sky above was a deep, foreboding grey, and I couldn't shake the feeling that a storm was brewing, despite the fact that the air was hot and still. Maddy and I stood there in silence for a moment, the only sound the creaking of the old wooden sign that hung crookedly from a rusty pole beside us. It read ""Welcome to Redemption"" in faded letters, a cruel joke given the state of the place."
We lugged our bags up the stairs and were sweating by the time we made it to the door. We came in through a screened-in porch that overlooked the lake. Maddy and,I shared a glance. It was adorable. White wicker rocking chairs and a small matching loveseat with thick floral cushions.

The smell of fresh-cut grass and lake water filled the air, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over me as I dropped my bag onto the floor. Maddy's mom, Karen, stood up to greet us, a warm smile spreading across her face as she enveloped us in a group hug. ""Welcome, girls! I'm so glad you're here. We've got a whole week of fun planned out for us."" She led us inside, where the house was cool and dim, with big windows that looked out over the lake. We spent the afternoon lounging around, getting settled, and catching up on each other's lives. As the sun began to set, Karen suggested we take a walk down to the dock, where we could watch the stars come out. We grabbed some blankets and headed down, the sound of crickets and frogs filling the air as we walked. The sky was a deep shade of pink and orange, with the stars just starting to twinkle like diamonds scattered across the fabric of the universe. We sat down on the dock, and Maddy pulled out a bag of marshmallows and a few skewers. ""S'mores, anyone?"" she asked, and we all cheered in unison."
"The bedrooms were off the living room on either side of a short hallway with a single bathroom shared in the middle. The bathroom had a white claw-foot tub, pale blue","tile, and an old pedestal sink. I took the room with the cushioned reading nook in the window and Maddy picked the one with the hanging swing chair in the corner.","walls, and a pedestal sink with a single faucet that had hot and cold water, a luxury for the time.

The bedrooms themselves were small, with just enough room for a bed, a dresser, and a closet. The floors creaked beneath your feet, and the windows let in a warm, golden light that seemed to dance across the walls. In the summer, the smell of fresh-cut grass and blooming flowers wafted in through the open windows, and in the winter, the fireplace in the living room crackled and popped, casting a warm glow over the entire house. Despite its age, the house had a cozy, welcoming feel to it, as if it had been waiting patiently for a family to come and fill it with love and laughter."
"Four hours later, Maddy and I were back at the cottage sitting in the screened-in porch.",We’d had dinner in town and then boated back. The fridge was stocked up and we’d unpacked.,"We were sipping lemonade and watching the sun set behind the trees, the tension between us",33,"We were sipping lemonade and watching the sun set behind the trees, the tension between us palpable as we both tried to process the events of the day. The air was thick with unspoken words, and I couldn't help but wonder what Maddy was thinking, her eyes fixed on some point beyond the horizon. I knew I had to break the silence, but the right words seemed to elude me, leaving us suspended in a state of uneasy quietude."
She looked away from me. “Emma…” Her eyes came back to mine. “Please. Please do it.,Do it now before you lose the chance to meet them altogether. People don’t live forever.”,"Don't make me beg.

Just do it and let me have some peace."
"“How about this,” Maddy said. “Run your DNA and make your account private. We’ll change your privacy settings for a few minutes, poke around. If you have any","relatives out there, we’ll screenshot it and go back to private. Then I’ll go and find them online and tell you if they seem like people worth knowing.”","relatives on the platform, we can see who they are and reach out to them.

We might find out something you don't want to know, or we might not find anything at all. Are you ready for that?"" Maddy's eyes were locked on hers, filled with a mix of excitement and concern. She took a deep breath and nodded, her heart racing with anticipation. ""I'm ready,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. Maddy smiled and pulled out her phone, opening the DNA testing app. ""Okay, let's do this."" With a few taps on the screen, the process began, and they waited anxiously for the results to come in."
We prioritized power for the coffee maker first and we brewed a pot while I sat in the kitchen with,"a towel wrapped around my head. When it was done, Maddy poured me a cup and handed it to me.","my laptop open, trying to get some work done while the aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled",40,"my laptop open, trying to get some work done while the aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air, and my roommate started making breakfast, the sizzling of bacon and eggs adding to the cozy atmosphere of our little apartment."
The snail’s-pace speed the pontoon put out somehow seemed faster with the beach approaching. Maddy threw it in reverse. The engine,"downshifted miserably, but we started to slow. Then to my horror we began to move backward, motor first, right into the dock.","roared in protest, spewing forth a cloud of noxious fumes as the pontoon jolted to a stop, its hull scraping against the rough",43,"roared in protest, spewing forth a cloud of noxious fumes as the pontoon jolted to a stop, its hull scraping against the rough stone of the jetty.

She took a deep breath, the salty air filling her lungs as she gazed out at the beach, the sound of the waves gently lapping at the shore a soothing balm for her frazzled nerves. As she stepped off the pontoon and onto dry land, the warm sun on her skin was a welcome sensation, and she felt a sense of peace wash over her, the tension of the journey slowly seeping away."
"When we were safely away from anything we could crash into, Maddy killed the engine and slumped in the captain’s","seat. “If we’d been on the other side of the dock, we could have hit the yacht,” she said, looking shaken.","chair, her eyes fixed on some point in front of her.

I followed her gaze, but there was nothing there, just the endless expanse of water stretching out to the horizon. The silence between us was oppressive, punctuated only by the sound of the waves gently lapping against the hull of the boat. I tried to break the silence, but Maddy just shook her head, her eyes welling up with tears. I knew better than to push her, so I just sat down beside her, putting a comforting arm around her shoulders. We sat there for a long time, the only sound the water and the creaking of the boat as it rocked gently in the swell. Eventually, Maddy spoke, her voice barely above a whisper. ""I'm sorry,"" she said, ""I just can't shake the feeling that we're being watched."" I scanned the horizon, but there was nothing in sight, just the endless blue of the ocean. ""There's no one out here, Maddy,"" I said, trying to reassure her. But she just shook her head, her eyes still fixed on some point in front of her. ""I know what I saw,"" she said, her voice firm. ""And I know what I felt."" I didn't know what to say to that, so I just sat there, holding her, as the sun began to set on the horizon."
"I lined the nose of the boat up with the side of the dock and started for it again, only this time I killed the thrust earlier. We",coasted along the side and I put us into reverse to slow us down while Maddy grabbed one of the dock poles and we came to a stop.,"coasted in, the rubber fenders compressing as we made contact with a gentle thud.

The sun was beginning to set, casting a warm orange glow over the marina, and I knew we had timed our arrival perfectly. Now, all that was left to do was to refuel, restock, and prepare for the next leg of our journey."
"Her phone rang. “Oh, hold on. I have to leave my ringer on in case Maddy gets in trouble trying to get back.” She looked at it. “It’s her.” She swiped and put the",phone to her ear. “Maddy?

I hadn’t really cared too much that Benny might not be here today. He wasn’t the point of this visit. But all that,had changed in the last ten minutes.

I had been so focused on what I wanted to say to him, on the words I had been rehearsing in my head for weeks, that I hadn't stopped to consider the possibility that he might not be here to hear them. Now, as I stood there, frozen in the doorway, I felt a wave of uncertainty wash over me. What was I supposed to do now? I looked around the room, hoping to find some kind of answer, but everyone else seemed to be going about their business as usual. It was as if nothing was out of the ordinary, as if Benny's absence was just a minor blip on the radar. But to me, it felt like a gaping hole, a reminder that sometimes the things we take for granted can disappear in an instant."
Jane led us through their living room and down a hall and stopped,by a closed door. “Everything’s ready. You guys can go in when you want.”,"at a door that she pushed open, revealing a room that seemed frozen in time,",27,"at a door that she pushed open, revealing a room that seemed frozen in time, the walls lined with old family photographs and dusty trophies that sparkled in the faint light that filtered through the grimy window."

Well I’m glad you made it, I was worried. Okay. Okay. I will. Bye.” She hung up.","in a deep breath and her eyes widened in surprise. ""What? When? Oh my god, Maddy, are you okay?""

“I hope so. It’s been a little stressful.” She picked up Murder Mittens. “I don’t think I really thought this island thing through. It,"sounded like a good idea at the time but it’s kind of inconvenient. Anyway, it’s only for six weeks and Maddy likes the cottage, so…”","was going to be a lot easier than it's turning out to be.

First, the contractor didn't show up on time, then the materials were delayed, and now I'm starting to worry that we won't be ready for the summer rush. And to top it all off, I've got a bunch of locals who are skeptical about the whole thing. I'm starting to feel like I've bitten off more than I can chew. Murder Mittens, on the other hand, seems to be taking it all in stride. She's been lounging around the house, napping in the sunbeams that stream through the windows, and purring contentedly whenever I pet her. I wish I could be more like her, but I'm afraid I'm just not wired that way. I'm a worrier, and this island thing is giving me plenty to worry about."

Maddy was already off the pontoon and running toward me across the beach.

""What is it?"" I asked, but she just shook her head and grabbed my arm, pulling me toward the water's edge. The waves were calm and peaceful, lapping gently at the shore, but Maddy's grip was tight and insistent. I followed her gaze out to sea, but saw nothing out of the ordinary - just the usual scattering of sailboats and seagulls wheeling overhead. ""What's going on?"" I asked again, but Maddy just pulled me closer to the water, her eyes fixed on something just beneath the surface."
"Amber was in a flowing white-and-peach chiffon summer dress with a slit up the thigh. Her long brown hair was down, she had on a floppy wide-brimmed hat and huge sunglasses. She was carrying","a bottle of champagne in one hand and her sandals in the other, dangling off the tips of her fingers.

She looked like a vision of summer itself, carefree and radiant, as she strolled through the crowded streets, drawing admiring glances from passersby. Despite the heat, she seemed to be glowing from within, her smile infectious as she made her way to her destination, wherever that might be."
"“Emma, you won’t believe my day,” she said, looking back at me. “So I wanted to surprise you. I flew all the way over here on","a red-eye, got an Uber, and came out to the address you gave me, but when I knocked on the door this handsome man answered instead.”","a whim, just to see you and give you this gift in person.

“Are you kidding me with this?” Maddy hissed as soon as they were out,of earshot. “She’s here for what? Six hours?

Maddy crossed her arms. “What she always does? Show up and leave a path of,"destruction in her wake? She’s not staying with us,” she said in her end-of-discussion voice.","destruction in her wake?

I'm starting to think we're all just a bunch of gluttons for punishment, eager to relive the same old drama and heartache that she always brings. But still, a part of me wonders, what's really going on behind those piercing green eyes of hers? What secrets is she hiding, and what's driving her to keep coming back to us, time and time again?"
Maddy rolled her eyes in the way that I knew meant she was aware. “Please tell me I don’t have to stay and watch,you eat crustaceans with that woman. Let’s just go back to the island and you see her tomorrow or something when she’s done with what’s-his-face.”,"the rest of this train wreck,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper, as she glanced around the room to make sure no one was listening in on our",49,"the rest of this train wreck,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper, as she glanced around the room to make sure no one was listening in on our conversation. I shook my head, trying to stifle a grin, knowing that Maddy had a knack for being brutally honest, even when it was the last thing I wanted to hear. “Unfortunately, you're stuck with me for the duration,” I replied, trying to sound as nonchalant as possible, despite the fact that my stomach was doing somersaults at the prospect of what was to come. Maddy let out a dramatic sigh and flopped down onto the couch beside me, her eyes fixed on the scene unfolding before us with a mixture of morbid curiosity and utter disdain."
I watched him walk to the beach and I let out a long breath. Maddy was right.,"This was bad. Mom never left anywhere on good terms. Not jobs, or apartments, or relationships. Especially relationships.","He was trouble, and I was better off without him.

I felt relieved the instant he said he would stay with me because it let Maddy off the hook. She would walk through hell for,me—and this cookout was her hell. I was glad she didn’t have to be here.

The shadows in my room seemed a little less ominous with him by my side, and I finally began to feel like I could breathe again. Little did I know, this was only the beginning of a long and difficult journey, but for now, I was just grateful for the small sense of peace that had settled over me."

And despite all her strengths, she's also got this vulnerable side that she only shows to those closest to her, which makes her all the more endearing. I have to say, I was really taken with her, and I think we could have a great time together."
"When I got back to the cottage an hour later, Maddy was in the screened-in porch, reading. She","wore shorts and flip-flops, and she was drinking a beer.

As I looked at my sister, I could feel the familiar frustration rising up, but I took a deep breath and tried to let it go. I reminded myself that she wasn't trying to be difficult, she was just struggling with her own issues. I made a conscious effort to soften my tone and my expression, to show her that I was there to support her, not to judge her. It wasn't easy, but I was determined to do better, for her sake and for mine."
"This was another thing I was trying not to think about—her leaving. I should be happy that she came at all, that she wasn’t in Hawaii. We still had three more dates, maybe more if I could convince her. I’d already gotten a freebie the other night at","Mom’s. But I dreaded the clock running out.

I had been thinking about it all day, and I was determined to make it happen. I had a plan, and I was going to stick to it. I would take her to the park, and then we would walk along the river. It was a beautiful night, and the stars were shining brightly. I could already imagine us sitting on a bench, holding hands, and talking about our dreams. I was excited, but at the same time, I was nervous. What if she didn't feel the same way? What if she was just being nice to me? I pushed those thoughts aside and focused on the present moment. I took a deep breath, grabbed my keys, and headed out the door to pick her up. As I drove to her place, I couldn't help but think about how much I wanted to make this night special. I wanted to make her happy, to make her feel loved. I wanted to show her that I was the right guy for her. I pulled up to her apartment, and my heart started racing. I took another deep breath, got out of the car, and walked to her door. I rang the bell, and she answered with a smile. My heart skipped a beat as I looked at her. She was beautiful, and I felt lucky to have her by my side. ""Hey,"" she said, and I smiled back at her. ""Hey,"" I replied, trying to sound calm. We stood there for a moment, looking at each other, and I could feel the tension between us. It was a good tension, a tension that I wanted to explore. I took her hand, and we walked to the car. The night was young, and I was ready to make it one to remember."

Emma pulled two Ziploc bags from her purse. They had Wheat Thins and celery in them.

"I think I would have been embarrassed if I’d been on a date with anyone else. My mother, sobbing drunk the night before",she left for prison. But I knew Emma didn’t judge.

He didn't judge me or try to offer any solutions; he just listened and let me be, which was exactly what I needed in that instant. As we sat there, watching the sun rise over the city, I felt a sense of peace wash over me, and I knew that I was exactly where I was meant to be."

On one hand, I was finally starting to find my footing in my career, landing a job at a prestigious company and receiving recognition from my peers. On the other hand, my personal life was in shambles, as I was going through a messy breakup and struggling to come to terms with the loss of a relationship that had defined me for so long. It was as if the universe was testing my ability to multitask, forcing me to navigate two opposing forces that were pulling me in different directions. I often found myself wondering how I was supposed to reconcile these two disparate aspects of my life, and whether it was even possible to find a sense of balance and harmony amidst the chaos."
"What did I have to offer her? I had nothing but baggage. Emotionally damaged, traumatized children that had been catapulted from one tragedy to the next, and me, barely keeping my head above water. Would I even have the time or the bandwidth to be any kind of partner while I was helping my",siblings navigate this situation?

I couldn't even begin to imagine how I would balance the needs of my kids with the needs of a partner, or if I would even be able to recognize what those needs were. The weight of responsibility was crushing me, and the thought of adding another person to the mix was almost too much to bear. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of uncertainty, and the idea of trying to find a lifeline to cling to seemed like an impossible task. As I stood there, frozen in indecision, I couldn't help but wonder if I was truly ready to open myself up to the possibility of love again, or if I was just setting myself up for another round of heartache and disappointment."
Sarah gave him a look. “Maybe for you. Hanging out with my brother,isn’t my idea of a good time. I’ll be outside.

I don't think I could handle the humiliation if he finds out about that before we even get a chance to discuss the business proposal. And what's taking him so long, anyway?

Whatever it was, it drove her to keep moving, to keep changing, and to keep pushing people away. I was just one of the many people who got caught up in her whirlwind, and I often wonder what would have happened if she had just stayed in one place long enough for me to really get to know her."
He nodded over his shoulder. “I should probably let you get back to work.

Only in a small town like this, where everyone knew everyone else's business, could a chance encounter like that leave her feeling so...intrigued. With a shrug, she turned back to her work, but her mind kept wandering back to the mysterious stranger and their brief, enigmatic conversation."
"“The whole house has it. I probably have it,” I added. “Sarah’s having a",panic attack. I have to go help.

I took her hand and did my best to make my face straight. People were already stopping to watch.

I could feel the weight of the crowd's gaze upon us, their curious stares and whispered conversations, and I knew that we were the main attraction in this impromptu spectacle. I squeezed her hand gently, trying to reassure her, but she didn't squeeze back, her hand remaining limp in mine. I glanced down at her, trying to read her expression, but her face was a mask of calm, giving away nothing. I had no idea what she was thinking, or what she was going to do next, and that uncertainty was making me more and more anxious by the second."
"“She’ll be home one day, Sarah. It’ll come faster than you think. You can visit her and write to her and call her.","You can stay close to her—you just have to try.

"After we finished with the lice, I set up the blanket in the backyard. With the landscaping Mom did, it was pretty nice back there with its hanging lights, citronella candles, and magnolia trees.

My mom smiled at me, and I could see the exhaustion of the day melting away from her face. We talked and laughed, savoring the taste of the pizzas and each other's company. As the night wore on, we decided to make s'mores over a small fire pit my dad had set up earlier. The flames danced and crackled, casting a warm glow over our little gathering. It was one of those nights that I knew I would cherish forever, a night that would stay with me long after the lice were just a distant memory."

I slid into my usual spot, feeling a sense of comfort and normalcy wash over me. It was moments like these that I cherished, a sense of routine and togetherness that seemed to be growing increasingly rare in our chaotic lives. As I reached for the glass of freshly squeezed juice my mom had poured for me, I felt a sense of gratitude for this little family of mine, and for the simple pleasures in life that often got overlooked in the hustle and bustle of everyday existence."
