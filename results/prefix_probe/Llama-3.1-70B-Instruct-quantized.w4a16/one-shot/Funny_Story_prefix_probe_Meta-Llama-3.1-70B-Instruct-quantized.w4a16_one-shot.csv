"Harvey snorts. “I know I’ve got a youthful glow, but I wasn’t born","yesterday. Come in, come in. Shoes off. Everyone’s back in the breakfast nook.”","yesterday, you know.

"I slip my loafers off next to Ashleigh’s knee-high boots and we follow Harvey down a narrow, wood-paneled wall toward the sound of smooth jazz and the potent smell of cigar smoke.

We weave past a few of them, exchanging nods and murmurs of greeting, before Harvey pushes open a door hidden behind a tattered tapestry and ushers us into a cozy, dimly lit space that feels like a cross between a study and a speakeasy. The air is thick with the scent of old books and leather, and the smooth jazz gives way to the soft crackle of a fireplace. Ashleigh lets out a low whistle as she takes in the room, her eyes scanning the shelves lined with vintage tomes and the comfortable-looking armchairs arranged around the fire. I can feel her excitement, her sense of being on the cusp of something big, and I have to admit that I'm starting to feel it too."

As they stood there, wrapped in each other's arms, the world around them melted away, leaving only the two of them, lost in the warmth of the moment."

Despite his mother's dismissal, he was convinced that his sister had been trying to tell him something, and he was determined to uncover the truth."
"Every night that week, we cook together—or Miles cooks, while Jules sits on the counter, curating a country playlist and singing along at top volume","into whatever utensil her brother has most recently set down.

Miles is a master of the grill, and Jules has a voice like honey, smooth and rich, and they're both so caught up in the moment that they don't even notice when I slip away to refill my drink or grab a towel to wipe down the counter. It's a small, domestic scene, but it's one that I've been craving for weeks, and I feel a pang of gratitude towards these two for letting me be a part of it, even if it's just for a little while."

I was thinking of having a small dinner party, just close friends and family, but now I'm not so sure.

I just want to get it over with and move on. Mulder's been trying to cheer me up, but even his usual antics can't seem to lift my spirits.

The dresser has a small mirror attached to it, and on the side table, there's a lamp with a plain white shade. It's a sparse, functional space, but it's clean and well-maintained. I notice a small book on the side table, and I walk over to investigate. It's a worn leather-bound volume, and as I open it, I see that it's a collection of poetry. The words are beautiful, but they seem out of place in this utilitarian room."
