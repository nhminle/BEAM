Despite this, Jake has a way of making me feel like he's known me forever, and I've grown accustomed to his easy smile and effortless charm. We've spent countless nights exploring the city, trying out new restaurants, and laughing until our sides ache, and yet, there's still a part of me that feels like he's missing out on a fundamental part of who I am. I've often wondered what he would think if he met my dad, if he would be surprised by the man behind the stories I've shared, or if he would simply nod knowingly, as if he's always understood the complexities of our relationship. The thought has crossed my mind more times than I can count, and yet, I've never mustered the courage to make the introduction, content instead to keep my two worlds separate, like parallel universes that never intersect."

"“That is wonderful news, sweetheart! Oh, I’m so thrilled! Why don’t you fly down to John Wayne the night","before, stay at the house, and we’ll all take the plane over together?

I just know this is going to be the start of something amazing for you, and I couldn't be prouder. When do you think you'll be able to make the trip? I'll start making arrangements as soon as you give me the word."
"“Anna?” he says, like he’s not entirely sure, and then does a full top-to-bottom sweep of my body, which recalls the lack of pants.","When he digs his hand into his luscious head of hair, I forget to be embarrassed again, because it all comes back to me.","His eyes linger on my legs for a moment before he looks away, clearing his throat, and I feel a flush rise to my cheeks as",48,"His eyes linger on my legs for a moment before he looks away, clearing his throat, and I feel a flush rise to my cheeks as I realize I'm still standing there in just my underwear. ""Anna, what's going on?"" he asks again, his voice softer this time, and I try to play it cool, like I'm not totally mortified. ""Just, uh, just getting ready for bed,"" I say, trying to sound nonchalant, but my voice comes out all shaky and unconvincing. He raises an eyebrow, clearly not buying it, and I can tell he's trying not to laugh. ""At...at 3 am?"" he asks, his tone skeptical, and I realize I'm not fooling anyone, least of all him."
The expression he makes is like the meme of that one kid who smiles and then immediately bursts into tears.,West is staring at me like he’s doomed but must pretend to be happy about it. “Anna. You look… great?”,"His face contorts in a mixture of emotions, as if he's trying to hold back laughter, but the absurdity",40,"His face contorts in a mixture of emotions, as if he's trying to hold back laughter, but the absurdity of the situation is too much for him to handle, and his smile quickly turns into a comical grimace, making everyone around him crack up."
"Stepping aside, I let him pass, and he pulls up short at what’s on the television screen. Conan is",enthusiastically fucking a witch in a cave.

I smile to myself, knowing that I'm in for a lengthy and enthusiastic discussion, and settle in to listen and respond."
"He adjusts his posture on the sofa, turning slightly to face me. Oh, right. He came here to","ask me for help. I sit up, too, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear.

His eyes seem to be searching for the right words, and for a moment, he just stares at me, his expression unreadable. I shift uncomfortably in my seat, trying to prompt him to continue, but he remains silent. The air is thick with tension as we sit there, the only sound the soft hum of the air conditioner in the background. Finally, he takes a deep breath and begins to speak, his voice low and measured."
"“I knew what Jake ordered for lunch and what kinds of stupid movies would make him laugh, and I could predict all his pickup lines","at parties, but we didn’t ever, like, sit down and do backstory. He didn’t even mention he had a brother until he suggested I marry you.”","by heart, but I had no idea what he was thinking or feeling, and that was the most frustrating part of all.

I felt like I was living with a stranger, someone who wore Jake's face but had a completely different mind and heart. It was like we were two people living separate lives, and I couldn't help but wonder if we would ever truly connect again. The distance between us seemed to grow wider with each passing day, and I found myself longing for the days when we were inseparable, when every thought and feeling was shared between us without hesitation. But those days seemed to be behind us now, and I was left to navigate this new, uncertain reality, trying to find my place in a relationship that was rapidly changing."
"“I definitely need to go back to the beginning,” I say, wiping my eyes. I mime an explosion at my temples. “Like—my mind is blown right now. You dressed like a middle schooler around the house. All basketball shorts, all the time. You drove a Honda! West, you’re incognito rich!","No wonder Jake never told me anything about his family! I would have made him pay for Jersey Mike’s every fucking time! Wait. Why did you need to live on campus? If you’re the grandson of the founder of Weston’s, you could probably buy an entire apartment building on Sunset.”","I stare at him, trying to reconcile the guy in front of me with the memories I have of him.

""I mean, I knew you were doing well for yourself, but...wow."" West chuckles and leans back in his chair, a self-deprecating smile on his face. ""I guess I've been keeping a low profile,"" he says. ""But I have to ask, what made you think I was just a regular guy?"" I shrug, feeling a little silly. ""I don't know, I just did. You never acted like you had a lot of money or anything."" West nods thoughtfully. ""I guess I just didn't want to draw attention to myself. But I have to say, it's kind of nice to be able to be myself around you."" He pauses, looking at me intently. ""You're not going to start treating me differently now that you know, are you?"" I laugh. ""No, of course not. You're still the same person to me."" West smiles, looking relieved, and we sit there in comfortable silence for a moment, enjoying each other's company."

“Correct.” He looks down to his lap. “Only Jake knew the real situation. The rest of my family was disappointed that,"I didn’t let them throw me a big wedding, but I guess they weren’t all that surprised. I’ve always been private.”","they couldn't understand why I wouldn't just take the easy way out and accept the offer. But Jake, he got it.

He was the only one who didn't try to persuade me otherwise, who didn't make me feel like I was making a huge mistake. His silence was a comfort, a reminder that someone out there understood me, even when it felt like the rest of the world didn't."
"He looks me over again, top to bottom, and the defeat in his eyes makes me realize the true extent of my unshowered, feral chaos. “Actually,","Anna,” he says, “I need you to come with me to my sister’s wedding in Indonesia and convincingly play the part of my very loving wife.”",",” he says, his voice softer now, “I think I can help you with that.” He gestures to the small bathroom behind him, and I notice for the",52,"“Actually,” he says, his voice softer now, “I think I can help you with that.” He gestures to the small bathroom behind him, and I notice for the first time that it's stocked with all the essentials: toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, and a fluffy towel that looks like it's never been used. My eyes widen in surprise, and I feel a lump form in my throat as I realize that this stranger is offering me a chance to reclaim a piece of my dignity. I nod, trying to speak, but my voice catches in my throat. He smiles kindly and hands me a small, wrapped package. “Here, take this. It's a change of clothes. They might not fit perfectly, but they're clean and they're yours if you want them.” I take the package, feeling a wave of gratitude wash over me. For the first time in what feels like an eternity, I feel a glimmer of hope."
"It’s surreal to be here with her after all this time. I was so close to being done with this, so near to the finish line, yet here I am, having to improvise an intricate plan B at the eleventh hour with a Muppet in human form as my co-conspirator. Don’t get me wrong, beneath the baked, unshowered disarray, Anna is still a beautiful woman, with enormous brown eyes, creamy skin, and long, willowy limbs. I’d always been fascinated with the perfect beauty mark just above her lip. Unfortunately, right now she looks like","she’s fallen out of a tree and crawled through a field of tangly briers to get back to her apartment. This is probably the closest I’ve ever seen to her natural hair color because the pink has grown out a good inch, leaving a stripe of brown at her roots. Her makeup is, I presume, from yesterday; shadows of mascara carve dark circles beneath her eyes. Despite the old makeup and frazzled appearance, there’s still something striking about her. Her eyes are enormous and bright, framed with dark lashes, her steady gaze entirely without artifice.","she just rolled out of a dumpster.

I offer her my arm, and she takes it, leaning on me heavily as we make our way towards the door. As we move, I can feel her eyes on me, boring into my skin. I know she's thinking the same thing I am - how did it come to this? How did we end up here, together, in this godforsaken place? I push the thoughts aside, focusing on the present. We need to get out, and then we can worry about the rest. I push the door open, and a sliver of sunlight cuts through the gloom, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air. We step out into the bright light, blinking, and I take a deep breath, feeling a sense of hope that I hadn't felt in hours. Maybe, just maybe, we can get out of this alive."

"As roommates, we didn’t know each other well—that much is probably obvious—but there is an intimacy to sharing a space with someone, a certain kind of kinship that comes with daily proximity. Anna was reasonably tidy and paid her half of the rent when it was due, but she’d never struck me as the organized, driven, premed type.

Still, I tried not to make assumptions, and I figured that maybe she just didn't like to talk about it. After all, we weren't exactly close, and I didn't know much about her life outside of our apartment. But as I stood there, staring at the remnants of her hasty departure, I couldn't help but wonder what had really driven her to pursue a career in medicine. Was it truly a calling, or was it just something she felt obligated to do? And what had happened to make her leave so suddenly, without even saying goodbye? The more I thought about it, the more questions I had, and the more I realized just how little I had known about the person I'd been living with for the past year."

"“Yes.” I work to not let my gaze do another sweep of her apartment. I’ve never been to Pulau Jingga, but my mom has been sending me info that I’ve mostly ignored for months. I know the basic idea—a luxury resort and conservation area set in the Indonesian archipelago—and it’s about","as far from this dark, cramped living room as I can imagine.

I raise an eyebrow, intrigued despite myself. ""What do you mean?"" I ask, but she just winks and says, ""You'll see."" And with that, she turns and heads back into her apartment, leaving me to wonder what I've just gotten myself into."

I've often thought about getting it re-framed, but something about the old, worn wood seems to add to the charm, a reminder of the many years it's been a part of our family's story."

She stops in front of the window and stares out at the city, feeling a mix of emotions swirling inside her. She's angry, hurt, and frustrated all at once. She doesn't know how to process everything that's been going on lately. She feels like she's losing control, and it's scaring her. Anna takes another deep breath and tries to focus on the present moment. She can't change the past, but she can try to move forward. She starts to think about what she needs to do to take care of herself, to calm down and regain her composure. She thinks about taking a warm bath, or going for a walk, or practicing some yoga. She knows she needs to do something to relax and unwind. As she stands there, lost in thought, Anna starts to feel a sense of determination wash over her.

Interestingly, research has shown that the optimal arrival time at the airport is around 2 hours prior to departure for domestic flights and 3 hours prior for international flights, but many people still choose to arrive earlier or later than that, depending on their personal preferences and travel styles."

It's a quality that I adore about her, but also one that makes me worry about how she'll handle the chaos that often ensues when my family gets together. As I watch her, I realize that I've been so focused on preparing her for the worst that I haven't stopped to consider how she might actually enjoy herself.

""Born ready,"" she says, and we make our way to the airport exit, joining the throngs of people streaming out into the bright sunlight. As we emerge from the terminal, the warm air envelops us, filled with the smells of exhaust and food carts. We hail a taxi and slide into the backseat, giving the driver the address of our hotel. The city whizzes by in a blur as we make our way to our destination, the sounds of car horns and chatter filling the air. I lean back and close my eyes, feeling the stress of the flight begin to melt away. We're finally here, and I'm ready to take on whatever the city has in store for us."

"Once, when we were roommates, Anna flew to Seattle with a friend. It had been her first time on an airplane, and she struggled so much navigating the travel website that she brought me her laptop at midnight and asked for help. I finished the transaction for her, prebooked the car","to the airport, and then quietly tracked the ride the day she left to make sure she got there okay. When she got home, she made a point of thanking me for the help. Apparently, the trip itself was fine, but the highlight for her had been flying on an airplane.","service, and even printed out the boarding passes.

It was moments like those that I cherished, and I often found myself wondering what our lives would be like if we still lived together, sharing late-night conversations and spontaneous adventures. As I sat in my current apartment, surrounded by the familiar comforts of home, I couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia for those carefree days, and the memories that Anna and I had created together. I smiled to myself, remembering the way she used to make me laugh, and the way our friendship had brought so much joy into my life. Little did I know, our friendship was only just beginning to take off, much like that first flight to Seattle, and the memories we would create in the years to come would be just as unforgettable."

I nod, trying to appear confident. ""Yeah, I do. He's got the skills and the experience. Plus, he's been looking for a new challenge."" West grunts, his expression unreadable, and I wonder if I've misjudged him entirely. The silence that follows is awkward, and I find myself fidgeting with the hem of my dress, trying to break the tension. Finally, West speaks up, his voice low and even. ""I'll talk to him. See what he's interested in."" I nod, feeling a surge of relief wash over me. Maybe, just maybe, this will work out after all."

I lay there for a moment, feeling the gentle rise and fall of her chest as she breathed, and the soft puffs of air against my skin as she exhaled. It was a comforting sensation, one that I hadn't experienced in a long time. I carefully shifted my position, trying not to disturb her, and wrapped my arms around her, holding her close. As I did, I felt a sense of peace wash over me, a sense of being exactly where I was meant to be.

My father's voice cuts through my reverie once again, and I turn to face him, trying to focus on the concern etched on his face. ""What's going on, kiddo?"" he asks, his eyes scanning me from head to toe, as if searching for some visible sign of what's wrong. I hesitate, unsure of how to articulate the turmoil brewing inside me, the sense of restlessness that's been growing for weeks now. The sound of the waves crashing against the shore provides a soothing background hum, but it's not enough to calm the storm brewing within me."
"“JESUS CHRIST,” I BLURT, the second I turn at the corner of our bridge and step onto the deck of our bungalow. Anna is curled up in","a papasan, with a sketch pad in her seemingly bare lap.

The words ""Jesus Christ"" seem to hang in the air, a desperate attempt to make sense of the chaos that's unfolding before my eyes.

""What's wrong?"" she asks, but I just shake my head, unable to find the words to explain. I collapse onto the couch beside her, trying to process the events of the past hour. The TV continues to drone on in the background, a constant reminder of the uncertainty that lies ahead."
