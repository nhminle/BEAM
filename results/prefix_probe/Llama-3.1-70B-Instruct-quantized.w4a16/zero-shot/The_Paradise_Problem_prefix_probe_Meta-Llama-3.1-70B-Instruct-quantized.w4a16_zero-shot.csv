He's been planning this heist for months, and I know he's not about to let a little thing like a security system get in his way. I watch as he expertly disables the alarm and slips inside, his movements swift and silent. I follow close behind, my heart racing with anticipation. We're in this together, and I trust him with my life. But as we make our way deeper into the building, I start to feel a sense of unease. Something doesn't feel right. The air is thick with tension, and I can tell that we're not alone. Suddenly, I hear a faint noise coming from the room next door. It's a soft whisper, but it's enough to make my skin crawl. I grab his arm, my eyes locked on the door. ""Do you hear that?"" I whisper, my voice barely audible. He freezes, his head cocked to one side, and for a moment, we just stand there, listening. Then, without a word, he nods and we both move forward, our senses on high alert."
"Jake: younger brother to West (and only slightly less good-looking) and that type of college friend who knows everything about my life at UCLA but has never met my father, who lives only an hour away.","Jake introduced me to West; now Jake will be my sole remaining connection to West. The thought makes me a little sad, but then I remember I have the couch and T-virus zombies waiting for me inside.","He's the kind of friend who knows my favorite coffee order, my go-to study spots, and the names of all my past relationships, but has never set foot in my childhood home or met the people who raised",73,"He's the kind of friend who knows my favorite coffee order, my go-to study spots, and the names of all my past relationships, but has never set foot in my childhood home or met the people who raised me. It's a strange dynamic, but one that I've grown accustomed to over the years. Despite the distance between our hometown and our college town, Jake has become a constant presence in my life, always ready with advice or a listening ear whenever I need it. We've shared countless memories, from late-night pizza runs to road trips along the coast, and I've come to rely on him as a source of comfort and support. But even with all that we've been through together, I sometimes wonder what he would think if he ever met my father, if he would be surprised by the man who raised me or if he would see the same person I do."

Are you okay?”","she smiles back, and for a moment, the emptiness of the apartment is filled with the warmth of our",39,"she smiles back, and for a moment, the emptiness of the apartment is filled with the warmth of our shared amusement. Her eyes sparkle with curiosity, and I can sense her trying to read between the lines, to understand what's behind my smile. I lean against the counter, my eyes never leaving hers, and begin to tell her the story of how I came to be standing in this empty apartment, with nothing but a suitcase by my side and a heart full of hope. As I speak, her expression changes from curiosity to surprise, and finally, to understanding, and I know that I've found a kindred spirit, someone who sees the beauty in the unknown and the freedom in starting anew."

I just can't wait to give you a big hug and hear all about everything that's been going on in your life.

Oh, and I almost forgot - I have a little surprise planned for your birthday, but I'll keep that under wraps for now. Let's just say it's going to be a night to remember!"
"“Anna?” he says, like he’s not entirely sure, and then does a full top-to-bottom sweep of my body, which recalls the lack of pants.","When he digs his hand into his luscious head of hair, I forget to be embarrassed again, because it all comes back to me.","His eyes widen slightly, and he takes a step back, his gaze lingering on my legs before he looks away, clearing his throat.",48,"His eyes widen slightly, and he takes a step back, his gaze lingering on my legs before he looks away, clearing his throat. ""I, uh, I didn't expect to see you like that,"" he says, his voice low and rough, and I can feel my face heat up with embarrassment. I try to play it cool, but my hands instinctively move to cover myself, which only makes me feel more ridiculous. ""I was just, uh, getting ready for bed,"" I say, trying to sound nonchalant, but my voice comes out high and awkward. He nods, still not looking at me, and takes another step back, his eyes fixed on some point behind me. ""I'll just, uh, go,"" he says, and turns to leave, but not before I catch a glimpse of a faint smile on his face."
The expression he makes is like the meme of that one kid who smiles and then immediately bursts into tears.,West is staring at me like he’s doomed but must pretend to be happy about it. “Anna. You look… great?”,"His face contorts in a mixture of emotions, as if he's trying to hold back laughter, but the absurdity",40,"His face contorts in a mixture of emotions, as if he's trying to hold back laughter, but the absurdity of the situation is too much to bear, and he ends up with a goofy grin that's both endearing and ridiculous.

The image is forever seared into your brain, a hilarious and relatable moment that you can't help but reference whenever you see someone else experiencing a similar emotional rollercoaster."
"Stepping aside, I let him pass, and he pulls up short at what’s on the television screen. Conan is",enthusiastically fucking a witch in a cave.

My roommate's eyes are glued to the screen as Conan begins to speak, his voice low and urgent. I can tell by the look on his face that something is wrong, and I feel a shiver run down my spine as I turn to listen. The words ""breaking news"" flash across the screen, and Conan's voice grows more serious, his words tumbling out in a rush. My roommate and I stand there, frozen, as the news sinks in, our minds struggling to process the enormity of what we're being told. The room around us fades away, and all that's left is the sound of Conan's voice, the city skyline behind him, and the weight of the news that's about to change everything."
"He adjusts his posture on the sofa, turning slightly to face me. Oh, right. He came here to","ask me for help. I sit up, too, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear.

His eyes seem to be searching for the right words, and for a moment, we just sit there in silence. The sound of the TV in the background is the only noise breaking the stillness.

""I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now,"" he says slowly, his words hanging in the air like a challenge. I lean forward, my curiosity piqued, and wait for him to continue."
"“I knew what Jake ordered for lunch and what kinds of stupid movies would make him laugh, and I could predict all his pickup lines","at parties, but we didn’t ever, like, sit down and do backstory.

I knew him better than I knew myself, and yet, despite all of this, I couldn't help but feel like I was losing him. It was as if the more I knew him, the more he slipped away from me, like sand between my fingers. I tried to hold on tighter, to grasp at the fragments of our relationship, but it was no use. He was fading away, and I was powerless to stop it. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of memories, each one a reminder of what we had, and what we were losing. I knew every inch of his body, every curve and every contour, but I couldn't reach him, couldn't touch him, couldn't make him stay."
"“I definitely need to go back to the beginning,” I say, wiping my eyes. I mime an explosion at my temples. “Like—my mind is blown right now. You dressed like a middle schooler around the house. All basketball shorts, all the time. You drove a Honda! West, you’re incognito rich!","No wonder Jake never told me anything about his family!

""But...but what about all the times we went to the mall and you complained about how expensive everything was?"" I ask, remembering the countless hours we spent wandering around the food court, trying to decide what to eat. West laughs. ""That was just part of the act, my friend,"" he says, winking at me. ""I wanted to fit in, to be like everyone else. And it worked, didn't it? You had no idea."" I nod, feeling a little silly for not seeing it sooner. ""Yeah, I guess it did,"" I admit. ""But now that I know, I have to ask...what's it like, being rich?"" West leans forward, a glint in his eye. ""It's...complicated,"" he says. ""There are a lot of expectations that come with having money, and sometimes it feels like a burden. But at the same time, it's given me the freedom to pursue my passions and live life on my own terms."" He pauses, collecting his thoughts.

""I never thought about it that way,"" I say, feeling like I'm seeing my friend in a whole new light."

I feel like I'm drowning in the stillness, suffocating under the pressure of my own thoughts, and I don't know how to escape. The silence is deafening, a cacophony of nothingness that's screaming in my ears, and I'm desperate to break free from its grasp. But for now, I'm trapped, suspended in this moment, unable to move forward or backward, stuck in the quicksand of my own emotions."
“Correct.” He looks down to his lap. “Only Jake knew the real situation. The rest of my family was disappointed that,"I didn’t let them throw me a big wedding, but I guess they weren’t all that surprised.

He remembered the countless nights they had spent talking about their aspirations, sharing their fears and doubts, and encouraging each other to take risks. Jake's unwavering support had given him the courage to pursue his goals, even when the rest of his family had lost faith in him. Now, as he sat in the dimly lit room, he couldn't help but feel a deep sense of gratitude towards his friend, and a pang of sadness that he was no longer there to share in his struggles and triumphs."
"He looks me over again, top to bottom, and the defeat in his eyes makes me realize the true extent of my unshowered, feral chaos. “Actually,","Anna,” he says, “I need you to come with me to my sister’s wedding in Indonesia and convincingly play the part of my very loving wife.”",", I think I'll just take your word for it,” he says, his voice laced with amusement, and I can tell he's trying not to laugh.

My hair is a tangled mess, my clothes are stained and torn, and I'm pretty sure I've got a few days' worth of dirt and grime caked onto my skin. I look up at him, feeling a flush rise to my cheeks, and he quickly looks away, clearing his throat. “So, uh, what's the plan here?” he asks, trying to sound nonchalant, but I can tell he's still trying not to stare at me in horror."
"It’s surreal to be here with her after all this time. I was so close to being done with this, so near to the finish line, yet here I am, having to improvise an intricate plan B at the eleventh hour with a Muppet in human form as my co-conspirator. Don’t get me wrong, beneath the baked, unshowered disarray, Anna is still a beautiful woman, with enormous brown eyes, creamy skin, and long, willowy limbs. I’d always been fascinated with the perfect beauty mark just above her lip. Unfortunately, right now she looks like","she’s fallen out of a tree and crawled through a field of tangly briers to get back to her apartment. This is probably the closest I’ve ever seen to her natural hair color because the pink has grown out a good inch, leaving a stripe of brown at her roots.

Her eyes are enormous and bright, framed with dark lashes, her steady gaze entirely without artifice.","she just rolled out of a dumpster.

I wait patiently, knowing that she'll eventually return to the present, her focus snapping back into place like a rubber band. The silence between us is comfortable, a testament to the ease with which we've grown to understand each other's quirks and habits. As I sit here, I find myself pondering the mysteries that lie beyond her distant stare, wondering what thoughts or memories have captured her attention. The room is quiet, the only sound the soft hum of the air conditioner in the background, a gentle reminder that time is passing, even as we seem frozen in this moment."
"As roommates, we didn’t know each other well—that much is probably obvious—but there is an intimacy to sharing a space with someone, a certain kind of kinship that comes with daily proximity. Anna was reasonably tidy and paid her half of the rent when it was due, but she’d never struck me as the organized, driven, premed type. The one time we talked about it, she","said something about medicine being the most palatable of the “real job” options, but she seemed overwhelmed a lot, studying late into the night and painting to decompress in what little free time she had.

But now, as I stood in the empty apartment, staring at the neat stack of boxes and the spotless kitchen, I realized I'd misjudged her. Anna had been planning this move for a long time, and she'd been doing it quietly, without drawing attention to herself. I felt a twinge of guilt for not knowing her better, for not being more supportive. We'd lived together for two years, and yet I'd never really taken the time to get to know her. I wondered what other secrets she'd been keeping, what other plans she'd been making without me noticing.

She hesitates, and for a moment, I think she's not going to answer. But then she takes a deep breath and launches into a detailed explanation of her vision for the resort's conservation program.

Apparently, the policy also covers 'acts of God', 'alien invasions', and 'unforeseen consequences of time travel'. I raise an eyebrow. 'Time travel?' She nods. 'Yeah, I know. I'm starting to think these people have been watching too many sci-fi movies.' I snort, trying to imagine the kind of person who would actually buy into this kind of thing. 'I guess you could say they're covering all their bases,' I say, trying to stifle a grin. She smiles back at me. 'Yeah, or maybe they just really love a good story.' We both laugh, and for a moment, the absurdity of it all is almost too much to handle."

They arrive at the airport with plenty of time to spare, and spend their extra hours browsing duty-free shops, grabbing a bite to eat, or simply people-watching from a comfortable seat. On the other hand, the latter group is often made up of more laid-back travelers who are confident in their ability to navigate the airport quickly and efficiently. They may even see the airport as an inconvenience, a necessary evil that stands between them and their final destination. Despite their differences, both types of airport people share a common goal: to get to their gate on time and catch their flight without any issues."

"Once, when we were roommates, Anna flew to Seattle with a friend.

After she returned from her trip, Anna would often talk about the stunning natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest, and how it had left her in awe. Her stories sparked a desire in me to explore more of the world, and I began to make my own travel plans. As we sat on the couch, swapping stories and sharing laughter, I felt grateful for the adventures we had shared, and the many more that were yet to come. Our friendship was a reminder that life was full of possibilities, and that sometimes, all it took was a little help from someone you trusted to set you on your way."

Her companion, sitting beside her on the couch, nods in agreement, and they both sit in silence for a moment, lost in their own thoughts. The sound of the television fades into the background as they process the gravity of the situation, the weight of the accused's actions sinking in. Suddenly, her companion speaks up, ""I don't know how they can live with themselves,"" they say, their voice laced with a mix of anger and sadness.

I glance over at Jake, who's still listening intently, and I realize that I'm not just describing her for his benefit. I'm trying to convince myself that she's real, that she's someone worth fighting for."

I mean, these kids have access to resources and opportunities that most people can only dream of. So, it's a double-edged sword, really.

As they stand there, frozen in wonder, the turtle swims right up to the water's edge and looks up at them, as if seeking connection with these two curious humans."

I try to shake off the feeling of unease that's settled in the pit of my stomach, telling myself it's just nerves from the impending conversation. But as I glance over at him, I catch a glimpse of something in his eyes that makes my heart skip a beat - a flicker of understanding, of empathy, that I've never seen before. It's disarming, and for a moment, I forget about my defenses, about the walls I've built up around myself over the years. I forget, and that's what scares me. I take a deep breath, trying to compose myself, but my mind is already racing ahead, wondering what other secrets he might be hiding, what other surprises he might have in store for me. The air is thick with tension as we stand there, the silence between us heavy with unspoken words. I can feel the weight of our unresolved issues bearing down on me, threatening to crush me beneath its oppressive weight. And yet, despite it all, I feel a spark of hope ignite within me, a spark that refuses to be extinguished, no matter how hard I try to snuff it out."

I remember feeling like I was on cloud nine, like nothing could ever bring me down. Of course, that was before I found out that he had also written songs for at least three other girls in the past year, and that his idea of a romantic gesture was actually just a clever way to get attention.
