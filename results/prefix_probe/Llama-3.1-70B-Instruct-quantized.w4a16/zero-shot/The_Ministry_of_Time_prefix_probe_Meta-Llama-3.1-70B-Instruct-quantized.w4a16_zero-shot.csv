"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking. Lacerations too, from a Taser—he’d shot at two of the team members who’d come to expatriate him, and a third was forced to fire.","the remaining five were still struggling to adjust to their new surroundings.

Graham, however, had been making remarkable progress, thanks in part to the tireless efforts of his assigned handler, Dr. Sophia Patel. A renowned expert in temporal displacement, Sophia had been instrumental in helping Graham navigate the vast cultural and technological chasm that separated his 19th-century upbringing from the bewildering realities of the 21st. As Graham's lucidity continued to improve, Sophia began to notice something peculiar – a nagging sense that her charge was withholding information, that there was more to his story than he was letting on. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but the feeling persisted, and Sophia found herself growing increasingly determined to uncover the truth about Graham's past. Little did she know, the truth would challenge everything she thought she knew about the nature of time itself."
"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into","his eighties.

The house had been renovated several times over the years, but it still retained much of its original charm. The interior was simple, with high ceilings and large windows that let in plenty of natural light. Gore would have appreciated the functional layout, designed to accommodate the needs of a working-class family. The Ministry had furnished the house with basic amenities, but it was clear that they had not intended for Gore to stay there for an extended period. Despite its modest appearance, the house had a certain character that Gore found endearing. He spent his days exploring the surrounding neighborhood, getting to know the local residents and learning about their lives. As he settled into his new routine, Gore began to feel a sense of belonging, a feeling he had not experienced in a long time."

He stared blankly at the wall, the cigarette dangling from his lips, as he tried to shake off the remnants of sleep. The sound of the water gently lapping against the sides of the bath was soothing, but his mind was already racing with the tasks he had to tackle that day. He took a long drag on the cigarette, feeling the familiar burn in his lungs, and slowly stood up, his joints creaking in protest. As he turned to face the mirror, he caught a glimpse of himself and was taken aback by the dark circles under his eyes and the stubble that had grown overnight. He rubbed his eyes, trying to remember the last time he had gotten a good night's sleep, and wondered if today would be any different."
"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale.

The crew was still trickling in, bleary-eyed and yawny, and the sound of hammering and drilling echoed through the empty halls. It was going to be a chaotic day, but Gore was undaunted, puffing away on his cigarette as he surveyed the mayhem around him. The plumber arrived, toolbox in hand, and set to work on the water-supply line, while Gore began to assign tasks to the crew. Despite the chaos, there was a sense of excitement in the air, a feeling that this was just the beginning of something big."

The chronometer, with its delicate balance wheel and intricate gearwork, was a far cry from the simple, practical tools that Gore would have been familiar with during his time at sea. It's likely that he would have been amazed by the chronometer's ability to keep accurate time, even in the most adverse conditions, and would have marveled at the ingenuity of its design. Despite his lack of technical expertise, Gore's experience as a naval officer would have given him a deep appreciation for the importance of accurate timekeeping, and he would have likely been fascinated by the chronometer's potential to revolutionize navigation and exploration. As he examined the device, he would have been struck by the realization that this small, intricate mechanism had the power to change the course of history, and he would have been eager to learn more about its inner workings and the brilliant minds that had created it."
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people. Hunting was out of the question, and socializing was limited by order of the Ministry.

His love for nature was evident in the way he spoke about the trees, the flowers, and the animals that inhabited the land around his home. He had a deep understanding of the world and its workings, and his insights often left me in awe. As I spent more time with him, I began to realize that his multifaceted personality was not just a product of his varied interests, but also a result of his unique life experiences. He had lived through times of great change and upheaval, and yet, he remained optimistic and open-minded, always eager to learn and grow. His presence was a reminder that it's never too late to discover new passions, to explore new horizons, and to become the person you've always wanted to be."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea.

This detachment allowed him to observe the world around him with a unique perspective, often noticing details that others might have overlooked. It also made him seem somewhat out of place in his own time, as if he were a relic from another era, struggling to adapt to the rapid changes that were taking place. Despite this, he was a keen observer of human nature, and his writings often reflected his insightful and sometimes humorous take on the world. His ability to step back and view things from a distance gave him a distinct voice, one that was both thought-provoking and engaging. As he navigated the complexities of his own life, he often found solace in his observations of the world around him, using them as a way to process his thoughts and emotions. This unique perspective would serve him well in his future endeavors, allowing him to make astute observations about the world and its inhabitants."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake.

I knew that I couldn't keep up the charade forever, but a part of me was terrified of what would happen when the truth finally came to light. Would Gore be angry? Disappointed? Would he even care? The uncertainty was suffocating, and I found myself withdrawing from him, afraid of getting too close, afraid of being found out. But at the same time, I couldn't help but feel drawn to him, like a moth to a flame. I was trapped in a web of my own making, and I didn't know how to escape. As the tension between us continued to build, I knew that I had to make a choice: come clean and risk losing everything, or keep up the act and risk losing myself."

Still, he reminds himself, it's not about the quantity, but the quality, and those three partridges will make for a fine dinner. He slings the sack over his shoulder and begins the walk back to the village, feeling the weight of his own expectations slowly lifting with each step."

The uncertainty is maddening, and he finds himself turning his palm over, studying it from every angle, searching for some clue that might explain the origin of the pain."
The ice outside shifts—the Arctic stammering its jaws as a cat does when it sees a bird. The ship’s cat died in convulsions during,"their second winter. Gore had liked that cat.

The captain stood at the helm, his eyes fixed on the horizon as if willing the ship to move forward, but it was stuck fast, trapped in the grip of the ice. The crew huddled together, their breath misting in the cold air as they waited for something, anything, to happen. And then, without warning, the ice shifted again, the sound like a low rumble of thunder, and the ship creaked and groaned in response.

The door creaked shut behind him, and I was left alone with the escort, who stood silently, eyes fixed on some point down the hall. I shifted my weight, feeling a growing sense of unease. What was Gore discussing in there, and why was I not included? The minutes ticked by, and I heard muffled voices, but nothing distinct. Finally, the door opened, and Gore emerged, his expression thoughtful. ""Let's go,"" he said to the escort, who nodded and led us back through the winding corridors of the Ministry. We walked in silence until we reached the entrance, where a sleek black car was waiting to take us back to our quarters. As we drove, Gore turned to me and said, ""I think we're in this deeper than I initially thought."" His eyes locked onto mine, and I sensed a gravity to the situation that I had not previously grasped."

Gore didn't seem to notice me approaching him, lost as he was in his own thoughts. I cleared my throat to announce my presence, and he turned to me with a look of mild surprise, as if he had forgotten I was there. ""What is it?"" I asked him, nodding towards the carving.

As we sat down at our table, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me, as if I was being transported to a different time and place. The bistro itself was a charming, old-fashioned establishment, with dark wood paneling, crisp white tablecloths, and the soft glow of candles flickering in the background. Gore, ever the traditionalist, opted for the bouillabaisse, a classic Provençal fish stew that he declared was ""the only civilized choice"" for a meal. I, on the other hand, chose the more modern option of a grilled chicken salad, which Gore eyed with suspicion, muttering something about ""the decline of Western civilization."" Despite our differences, we spent the next hour engaged in lively conversation, discussing everything from the merits of various cooking techniques to our shared love of French cinema. As we lingered over our coffee, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the opportunity to experience a slice of history, if only for a brief afternoon."
"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to",take us to”—here he raised his eyebrows—“a public house.

As we walked further, I noticed that the villagers were indeed leaving me alone, and I felt a sense of gratitude towards Gore for making that happen. We eventually reached the edge of the village, and Gore stopped in front of a small wooden bridge that spanned a narrow stream. He turned to me and said, ""This is the bridge I was telling you about. It's sturdy and safe, and it will take you across the stream and into the forest beyond."" I looked at the bridge and saw that it was indeed well-built, and I felt a sense of excitement at the prospect of exploring the forest.

As the evening wore on, I found myself feeling more and more at ease in his presence, and I began to see him in a new light. He was more than just a kind stranger who had offered me a place to stay - he was a complex, multifaceted person with his own struggles and triumphs. As the night drew to a close, I thanked Gore for the drink and the company, and we walked back to the house in comfortable silence. I felt a sense of gratitude towards him, not just for the roof over my head, but for the unexpected connection we had made. As I drifted off to sleep that night, I couldn't help but wonder what other surprises this small town had in store for me."

I had to do those for him, in the early days, because he still didn’t know how, and the English-language internet was not on my side. Exotic, friendly, conservative, resilient.

I began to wonder if we had been living in separate worlds all along, our experiences and perspectives so vastly different that they might as well have been from different planets. The more we talked, the more I felt like I was losing my footing, struggling to find common ground in a conversation that seemed to be slipping further and further away from me. As the hours ticked by, the silence between us grew thicker, a palpable presence that seemed to pulse with unspoken words and unresolved tensions. I couldn't shake the feeling that we were standing at the edge of a precipice, staring into an abyss of misunderstanding and miscommunication, with no clear way to bridge the gap between us."
"He smiled, dimples curving. “I think, as we are ‘housemates,’","and also, I hope, friends, that you should call me Graham.”","it would be nice to get to know each other a bit better, don't",21,"it would be nice to get to know each other a bit better, don't you think?” He leaned against the counter, his eyes sparkling with amusement, as if daring her to refuse. The air was thick with tension, and she could feel the weight of his gaze on her skin, making her heart beat just a little bit faster. She hesitated for a moment, unsure of how to respond, but then a small smile played on her lips as she nodded in agreement."
"“After you returned home yesterday, the Brigadier came back to see Arthur. They had a conversation","about television, which Arthur seems to think is a wonderful invention.

Although I couldn't make out the specifics of their discussion, the tone was unmistakable - something was amiss, and it was clear that the Brigadier's visit was not merely a social call. As the evening drew to a close, the Brigadier departed, leaving Arthur to his thoughts, which seemed to be weighing heavily on his mind. The rest of the household retired for the night, but I suspect Arthur remained awake, his mind racing with the implications of their conversation."

Luckily, the river was calm, and they managed to swim to the shore, where they were met with the concerned faces of their crew. The wound had been severe, but the captain's quick thinking and the crew's makeshift medical skills had saved his life. Now, years later, the scar still lingered, a reminder of the perils of exploration and the debt he owed to his captain and crew. As he stood on the deck, the salty spray on his face, he couldn't help but think of that fateful day and the journey that had brought him to this moment. The thrill of discovery still coursed through his veins, and he felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude for the life he had lived and the experiences that had shaped him into the man he was today."
"It’s surprising, then, that I allowed Graham’s drawing of the projection device to enter my files as a joke, like a coin minted 70 BC. I thought it was a form of juvenilia, drawn in","his earliest years as a modern man, something to remind him of on a significant anniversary of his arrival here; and not, as it would turn out to be, a red letter from another era.","a moment of boredom or distraction, a doodle that would be forgotten by the next day.

I found myself returning to it again and again, studying the crude lines and shapes as if they held some hidden significance. And then, one night, I had an epiphany - what if this wasn't just a joke? What if Graham had stumbled upon something real, something that could change the course of our understanding forever? I felt a shiver run down my spine as I gazed at the drawing, my mind racing with the possibilities. I knew I had to talk to Graham, to find out what had inspired this strange and fascinating design. Little did I know, our conversation would set off a chain of events that would challenge everything I thought I knew about the world."
"By the start of that summer, Graham was practically a native of the era. He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle. Most mornings he rose—hours before me—and",went for a run. He would sometimes wake me up with a juicy smoker’s wheeze on his return to the house.

He'd sit at the table, sipping his coffee and reading the newspaper, a ritual he'd adopted from the locals. I'd often find him chatting with the neighbors, exchanging stories and laughter, as if he'd lived there his entire life. His transformation was nothing short of remarkable, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in how seamlessly he'd adapted to this new world. As the summer solstice approached, Graham's affinity for the era only deepened, and I began to wonder if he'd ever be content to return to our own time."
"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past. I was prickly and defensive about","this; I could not look at why directly. I heard the way I spoke to him about it: adjustment, reasonable, citizen, responsibility, values. He blew a lot of pensive cigarette smoke at me.","the way he would often dismiss the modern world, as if it was somehow less authentic than the one he had grown up in.

I felt like he was judging me, judging my generation, and it made me want to prove him wrong. But at the same time, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of admiration for his unwavering commitment to his own values and experiences. It was as if he was a relic from another era, a reminder of a time when things were simpler, yet more complicated in their own way. I often found myself wondering what it would have been like to live in his shoes, to have grown up during a time of such great social change and upheaval. Would I have been as resilient, as adaptable, as he was? Or would I have been overwhelmed by the sheer pace of it all? These were the kinds of questions that swirled in my head whenever I was around Graham, and they only added to the enigma that surrounded him."
"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them. Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled","to focus on the tests—eyes moving rapidly.

"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too. Even Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had","fought in large-scale battles, were laid out by the ultramodern scope of the harm.

Nineteen-sixteen, still recovering from the sedation, was particularly withdrawn, and the others tried to be supportive, but it was clear that the experience had left a lasting impact on all of them. As the days passed, the expats began to open up about their feelings, sharing their thoughts and emotions with each other in a way they never had before. It was a turning point in their relationships, one that would ultimately bring them closer together. But it also raised questions about the true cost of their participation in the experiment, and whether the benefits were worth the risks to their mental and emotional well-being."
"Adela was always present at the honesty exams, often intervening in them. I got the impression that she was listening to offstage prompts that only she could","hear, being the only one among us who was aware she was on a stage, and was trying to chivvy us along the right course of action.","hear, and that she was being fed information that the rest of us were not privy to.

I tried to brush it off as mere paranoia, but the feeling persisted, and I couldn't shake the sense that something was off. As the exams continued, I began to notice that Adela's interventions were not just random, but seemed to be targeted at specific students. She would swoop in and start questioning them, her eyes narrowing as if she was searching for something. It was unnerving, to say the least, and I found myself wondering what she was looking for. Was she trying to uncover some kind of cheating ring, or was there something more sinister at play? I didn't have the answers, but I was determined to find out. I started paying closer attention to Adela's behavior, trying to decipher the patterns behind her actions. And then, one day, I stumbled upon something that made my blood run cold."
"Adela smiled with about a third of her mouth. Her face had changed again. She looked pinched and hungry,",and hauntingly as if her skin was held in place by a bulldog clip at the back of her skull.,her eyes sunken into dark wells that seemed to hold a thousand unspoken words.

The smile, a mere whisper of its former self, still lingered on her lips, a haunting reminder of the girl she once was, before the weight of the world had settled upon her shoulders."
"I went along to one of the earliest dinners, chicken bag slung over my shoulder. Bridges tended not to eat at the Ministry canteen with administrative staff and the operators on the Wellness team—the office-based employees—and the decorous hostility with which the paper pushers met me was adorable. When I got to the","kitchen itself, the first thing I saw was Graham leaning down to light a cigarette on the gas ring, his curls dangerously close to the hob.

The waiter arrived promptly to take my order, and I opted for the special of the day, a grilled salmon that sounded too good to pass up. As we waited for our food to arrive, Bridges filled me in on the latest developments in the Wellness team's efforts to address the growing concerns about the Ministry's handling of the recent crisis. His words were laced with a mix of frustration and determination, and I found myself drawn into the conversation, eager to offer my own insights and suggestions. The dinner turned out to be a working meeting in disguise, but I didn't mind – it was a welcome change of pace from the usual Ministry politics. As the evening wore on, our discussion turned to the topic of the mysterious occurrences that had been plaguing the city, and I couldn't help but feel a shiver run down my spine. Bridges noticed my reaction and leaned in, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. ""I think we're just starting to scratch the surface of something much bigger,"" he said, his eyes locked intently on mine. I felt a surge of excitement mixed with trepidation – what were we getting ourselves into?"

The memories came flooding back, and for a moment, I forgot about the reason I was sitting in this dimly lit, smoky bar, surrounded by the murmur of hushed conversations and the soft clinking of glasses. The bartender, a woman with a kind face and a warm smile, leaned in close, her voice barely above a whisper, ""You okay, hon? You look like you've seen a ghost."""
"Graham said, “Hm!” and pulled hard on his cigarette.

He walked down the street, taking long strides, his eyes scanning the crowded sidewalks with a mixture of curiosity and disinterest. The sounds of the city swirled around him - the chatter of pedestrians, the wail of sirens in the distance, the rumble of the subway beneath his feet. Graham felt a sense of detachment, as if he were observing the world around him through a thick pane of glass. He turned a corner, and the bright lights of a diner caught his eye. On a whim, he pushed open the door and stepped inside, the bell above the entrance jingling as he entered. The diner was a greasy spoon, the kind of place that served up burgers and fries to the late-night crowd. Graham slid onto a stool at the counter, running a hand through his hair as he perused the menu. The waitress, a friendly-looking woman with a warm smile, came over to take his order. ""Just coffee, black,"" Graham said, his voice low and smooth. The waitress nodded, her eyes flicking to the cigarette still clutched in his hand. ""You know you can't smoke in here, hon,"" she said, her tone gentle but firm. Graham raised an eyebrow, but said nothing, simply stubbing out the cigarette in the ashtray provided. The waitress nodded in approval, and moved off to pour his coffee. As he waited, Graham's eyes wandered around the diner, taking in the eclectic decor - the faded photographs on the walls, the chrome accents on the counter, the worn vinyl booths in the back. It was a place that seemed frozen in time, a relic of a bygone era. And yet, despite its retro charm, the diner felt strangely comforting, a haven from the chaos of the city outside. Graham's coffee arrived, and he wrapped his hands around the cup, feeling the warmth seep into his bones. For a moment, he simply sat, savoring the silence, the stillness of the moment. It was a fleeting sense of peace, one that he knew wouldn't last. But for now, it was enough."
"“No,” said Margaret. She shrugged at my expression. “An’ I forsake this duty,” she said, “we’ll sicken. Forty-seven",thinks tobacco is an herb.

The Brigadier drifted closer. He did look hungry. He looked like I did as a student when I ate nothing but buttered,toast and apples. He turned the white of used candlewax when Margaret opened the oven to better squint at her roast potatoes.,"toast for a week because I couldn't afford anything else.

He took another step closer, his movements slow and deliberate, like a predator stalking its prey. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, and my mind racing with possibilities. What did he want from me? And how was I going to get out of this situation alive?"

Still, I have every confidence in his ability to navigate these treacherous waters, for he has always been a steady hand in times of turmoil. And yet, despite my faith in him, I could not shake the feeling of unease that settled in the pit of my stomach as I watched him ride off towards the village, his jaw set in a determined line."
"Because we lived in a government-owned residence, there were also restrictions on how","long we could have the air-conditioning on.

"Movement was anathema. I slept, mostly, naked and poaching in my sweat. The water ration forced Graham to switch finally to thirty-second showers.

I lost track of time, unsure whether it was day or night, as the sun beat relentlessly against the windows. Graham's absence was a welcome respite, but the solitude was starting to get to me. I began to wonder if anyone else was still out there, or if we were the last two survivors of a world that had been ravaged by the heat. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I pulled the damp sheet up to my chin, trying to shut out the desolate landscape that lay beyond our sweltering little bubble. As the days blended together, I started to feel like I was slowly losing my grip on reality. The heat wave had become a living, breathing entity, a malevolent force that was determined to consume us all."
"Adela took bridge meetings in a soundproof room deep in the Ministry’s chest. She always arrived first, and we’d find her sitting at the top of",a long table like a mannequin awaiting the gift of demonic possession.

She would listen attentively to our reports, her eyes narrowing slightly as she considered each point, before responding with thoughtful, well-reasoned questions. Despite the high stakes of our discussions, Adela's presence had a calming effect on the room, and we all felt more focused and productive with her at the helm. As the meetings drew to a close, Adela would summarize the key points and action items, her words dripping with an air of quiet authority that left no doubt as to who was in charge."
Adela was standing at the sink and anarchically disobeying the water ration by running her wrists under cold,"water.

As she stood there, she couldn't help but think about the world outside, a world where people didn't have to worry about every drop of water they used. She imagined lush green forests, vast oceans, and sparkling lakes, and for a brief moment, she felt a sense of freedom and escape. But the sound of footsteps outside the door brought her back to reality, and she quickly turned off the tap, feeling a pang of guilt for her momentary indulgence."
"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it,","was a mystery. She didn’t enjoy the prestige, as the Secretary did, and she seemed bizarrely overworked for the proxy boss of a project in its pilot stage.","remained a mystery to everyone in the office.

Her eyes would roll with each question, her voice dripping with disdain as she explained the most mundane tasks as if we were simpletons. The rest of us exchanged knowing glances, our frustration growing with each passing day. How did someone so clearly unsuited to the role manage to secure it, and what did she hope to achieve by treating us all like incompetent fools?"
"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had","just discovered that a woman with whom he was spending a lot of time would never be interested in him.

Instead, I simply sat with him, a silent companion in his moment of vulnerability. As we sat there, I couldn't help but wonder what had brought him to this place, what secrets he was hiding behind those piercing eyes. And I found myself wanting to know more, to peel back the layers and uncover the truth about this enigmatic stranger."

Anyway, I'm sure he'll be happy to meet you, once you're properly introduced. Just don't expect him to go out of his way to make small talk – he's not exactly the chatty type."
"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders. The bridges kept turning in their core reports, and the experiments kept running.

Adela's eyes locked onto mine, her gaze intense. ""I need you to review the data, to see if you can find any patterns or anomalies. We need to know what's going on, and we need to know now."" I nodded, my mind racing with possibilities. I knew that this was a critical moment, one that could make or break the entire project. I was determined to get to the bottom of it, no matter what it took."
"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events. He’d lain motionless in the garden for two hours, on","a wet and putrid night, to shoot a fox, and pulled out one of his own rotting teeth (he showed it to me afterward; it was the color of a tombstone, caped with gelatinous red)—was this Victorian, or was this “irregularities”?","the stone bench, his eyes fixed on some point beyond the treeline.

I'd tried to rouse him, but he hadn't responded, not even to the sound of his name. The sun had begun to set, casting long shadows across the garden, and still he remained frozen. I'd considered calling for an ambulance, but something about the scene stayed my hand. It was as if Graham had simply stepped out of the world, leaving me to wonder if I was dreaming the whole thing. As the stars began to twinkle in the night sky, I reluctantly went inside, leaving him to his mysterious reverie. The next morning, I found him in the kitchen, sipping tea and reading the newspaper as if nothing had happened. I asked him if he was feeling alright, and he looked up at me with a hint of surprise, as if he'd forgotten I was there. ""Of course, I'm fine,"" he said, his voice a little gruff. ""Why wouldn't I be?"" I didn't press the issue, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something fundamental had shifted, like the subtle realignment of the planets. From that day on, I watched him more closely, searching for signs of whatever it was that had taken him away from me, if only for a little while."
"So I was anxious about Graham’s disdain for the twenty-first century, because never mind that I felt rejected by it, I was worried that the universe would feel the atemporal sting of his contempt and take","him away.

I know it sounds irrational, but I couldn't shake the feeling that Graham's negative attitude towards the twenty-first century was a contagion that could spread and affect me in some way. I tried to brush it off as mere paranoia, but the feeling lingered, making me wonder if I was somehow tied to Graham's perception of the world. Was I just a reflection of his disdain, a mere echo of his discontent? The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I couldn't help but wonder if I was just a pawn in some larger cosmic game, one that Graham was playing with the universe itself. As I pondered this, I couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation, a feeling that the universe was indeed watching, waiting to see how I would react to Graham's rejection of the twenty-first century. And so, I waited, frozen in anticipation, as the universe seemed to hold its breath, waiting for me to make my next move."
"I persuaded Graham to use the tiny office, in which I ordinarily worked, to cram for the test. The Ministry gave no indication of what format","the test would take, or what manner of questions would be asked, or tasks set.

I was confident that he would do well, but I couldn't shake the feeling that the Ministry had something up its sleeve. On the morning of the test, Graham and I arrived at the Ministry early, and were ushered into a large, dimly lit room filled with rows of desks. The other test-takers were already seated, their faces set with determination. Graham took a deep breath, and we exchanged a nod of encouragement before he took his seat and the test began."

The room seemed to grow quieter, as if everyone was holding their breath in anticipation of what he might do next. And then, in an instant, he turned and disappeared into the crowd, leaving behind a sense of unease that lingered long after he was gone. I turned to Salese, who was watching me with a curious expression, and raised an eyebrow. ""Who is that?"" I mouthed, but she just shook her head and leaned in closer. ""I have no idea,"" she whispered, ""but I think we're about to find out."""

Please, come in.”"
"I went home and, on arrival, checked my emails. As with a driving",test—or the lieutenants’ exam—the acclimatization exam results were delivered immediately.

The subject line read "" Urgent: Your Digital Licence is at Risk"". My heart sank as I opened the email, fearing the worst. But to my surprise, it was just a phishing scam trying to get me to click on a suspicious link. I breathed a sigh of relief and deleted the email, making a mental note to be more careful in the future. I then proceeded to check my social media accounts, where I found a flurry of notifications from my friends and family. It seemed that everyone was having a great day, and I couldn't help but feel a little left out. I decided to post a status update, hoping to get some attention and feel more connected to the world. As I typed away, I couldn't help but wonder what other digital surprises the day had in store for me."
"I cycled up to the nice grocery store to buy a bottle of champagne, pausing on the way home for a soft-serve ice cream. I sat on the bench to lick the ripple into a mound and think about the","Brigadier.

The thought brought a wide smile to my face, and I couldn't wait to see it all come together. I finished my ice cream, feeling content and eager to get home and put the final touches on the party preparations. The rest of the evening was going to be unforgettable."

Arthur, being the romantic that he is, would likely fall in love with the picturesque lochs and the sound of the bagpipes carried on the wind. I, on the other hand, would be content with the peace and quiet, and the freedom to pursue my passions without the constant scrutiny of the media. Together, we could build a life that is truly our own, one that is filled with love, laughter, and adventure."
"When I brought the glass up—stoppering the rest of the bottle for dinner—I could hear Graham singing “I love to steal awhile away,” occasionally muffled by his drags on a cigarette. Water plashed against the tub.","He dropped to humming and presumably soaping. I slid quietly to the floor and leaned my head against the wall. I wasn’t going to see a Ministry therapist.

I let out a deep sigh, feeling my body relax even further, and let the tranquility wash over me."
"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century.

His small kitchen was well-stocked with an assortment of pots, pans, and utensils, and he spent many an evening whipping up a storm, the aromas wafting from the stove a testament to his growing prowess. As he cooked, Graham felt a sense of calm wash over him, the stresses of his day melting away with each sizzling pan and simmering sauce. It was a feeling he had grown to cherish, and one that he looked forward to indulging in whenever the opportunity arose. The rhythmic chopping of vegetables, the soft sizzle of meat hitting the pan, and the comforting aromas that filled the air all combined to create a sense of tranquility that eluded him in most other aspects of his life. And so, Graham continued to cook, lost in the simple joys of creation, as the world outside his kitchen door seemed to fade away."

As the evening wore on, Arthur's laughter echoed through the room, a contagious sound that drew others in and made them feel like they were part of something special. And though he was the center of attention, Arthur never seemed to seek it out, content instead to simply be present and enjoy the company of those around him."

"How the topic of weed came up I couldn’t remember—probably during one of the vigorous debates about what the twenty-first century had genuinely improved, which in",the opinion of the expats was a mixed bag.

I found myself caught in the middle, trying to make sense of the conflicting opinions and wondering if the benefits truly outweighed the risks. As the debate raged on, I couldn't help but think about the complex history of weed and how it had evolved from a taboo substance to a topic of mainstream discussion.

I felt a sudden urge to know more about her, to unravel the mystery that surrounded her like an aura. And so, I took a step forward, inserting myself into the circle of admirers, and waited for an opportunity to strike up a conversation. As I waited, I couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation, wondering if I would be able to keep up with her, to match her level of intensity and charisma. But I was determined to try, to see if I could learn from her, to absorb some of that magnetism for myself.

It wasn't until they stumbled upon a small, rundown café on the outskirts of town that the tension finally began to dissipate. Over steaming cups of black coffee, he launched into a tale of his childhood, of laughter and love and loss, and for the first time, Sixty-five saw a glimmer of the man behind the mask."

However, a small group of music enthusiasts has emerged, seeking to preserve the art of live music and the human connection that comes with it. They argue that the music boxes, despite their technical prowess, lack the soul and emotional depth that only a live performance can provide.

As she made her way to the chair, she kicked aside a stray sock that had been lingering on the floor for days, and plopped herself down with a sigh of contentment. I watched her, fascinated by her ability to find comfort in a space that I had been too anxious to inhabit. She looked up at me, a hint of a smile playing on her lips, and said, ""So, this is where the magic happens."" I raised an eyebrow, unsure of how to respond, but she just laughed and said, ""Don't worry, I'm not here to judge. I'm just happy to be out of the rain.""

The other expats seemed to have adapted more easily, gathering at the Ministry-sponsored social events and exchanging stories of their adventures. Graham had attended a few of these gatherings, but he always felt like an outsider, a ghost hovering on the periphery of their conversations. His wife's voice on the phone was the only thing that seemed real to him anymore, a reminder of the life he had left behind."
"Arthur was striding up the street, bent slightly against a wind which didn’t exist. He was wearing a tweed jacket and looked like a period piece,","but then again, so did Pimlico.

The people passing by him seemed to be moving in a blur, their faces a mere smudge as he walked. His hands were shoved deep into his pockets, and his shoulders were hunched up, giving him a slightly defensive air. The buildings around him seemed to loom over, their windows like empty eyes staring back. He turned a corner, and the sounds of the city grew louder, a cacophony of car horns and chatter that he tuned out as he walked. His destination was a small café a few blocks away, a place he had been going to for years, where the owner knew him by name and the coffee was always strong. He pushed open the door, and a bell above it rang out, announcing his arrival to the handful of patrons inside."
"It paid off in the early autumn. When I came down for breakfast one morning, I found","Graham at the counter with a dictionary and a tin of protein powder, performing exegesis on the label.","my mother and father sitting at the kitchen table, surrounded by the remnants of a meal that had clearly",35,"my mother and father sitting at the kitchen table, surrounded by the remnants of a meal that had clearly been interrupted.

My mother looked up as I entered, a mixture of excitement and nervousness etched on her face, while my father simply nodded at me, his eyes fixed intently on some point beyond my shoulder. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I took in the scene, sensing that something momentous had occurred, something that would change the course of our lives forever."
"Adela was of the “never been to the GP in my life because I’m not a pussy” school of care, and nothing changed. If the expats were","dangerously ill, they’d be removed to the wards and never mind the trigger; if they could get a grip and deal with it at home, they should.","going to get sick, they would get sick in the comfort of their own homes, with a stiff upper lip and a bottle of scotch. The locals, on the",54,"going to get sick, they would get sick in the comfort of their own homes, with a stiff upper lip and a bottle of scotch. The locals, on the other hand, seemed to have a different approach to healthcare. They would often gather in the town square, sharing stories of their ailments and offering each other advice on the best remedies. Adela had always been fascinated by this communal approach to health, but she had never felt the need to join in. That was until she met Sofia, a local woman who had taken Adela under her wing and introduced her to the world of traditional medicine. Sofia was a firm believer in the power of natural remedies and had spent years studying the healing properties of the local plants. She would often take Adela on long walks through the countryside, pointing out the different herbs and explaining their uses. Adela was amazed by the wealth of knowledge that Sofia possessed and found herself drawn to the idea of a more holistic approach to healthcare. As she spent more time with Sofia, Adela began to realize that there was more to health than just not being sick. She started to see the interconnectedness of the body and the mind, and the importance of taking care of oneself in a more holistic way. This newfound understanding sparked a change in Adela, and she slowly began to shift her approach to healthcare. She started taking long walks in the countryside, breathing in the fresh air and listening to the sounds of nature. She began to experiment with natural remedies, using the herbs that Sofia had taught her about to soothe her ailments. And she started to prioritize her mental health, taking time each day to meditate and connect with her inner self. It wasn't always easy, and there were still times when Adela felt the urge to reach for the scotch. But with Sofia's guidance and support, she slowly began to find a new sense of balance and well-being. As the months passed, Adela noticed a profound shift in her overall health. She felt more energized and vibrant, and her mind was clearer than it had been in years. She realized that she had been living in a state of disconnection, and that her body and mind had been suffering as a result. But now, thanks to Sofia and the world of traditional medicine, Adela felt like she was finally coming home to herself."
"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs. Given the prevalence of prostitution in Victorian England, the nonexistence of reliable barrier contraception in his era, and the fact that he was a sailor, this suggested he was either a virgin or very lucky. But then again, I knew enough about his biography to know that he was very, very lucky.","output>of the transcript of that session, and I'd read it several times, trying to decipher the nuances of his responses.

He'd also mentioned that he found the language surrounding sex to be ""coarse"" and ""unbecoming,"" which had led the analyst to note that Graham's own language was often formal and antiquated, as if he were trying to distance himself from the world around him."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory. Every time I gave Graham a book, I was trying to shunt him along a story I’d been telling myself all my life.","something almost palpable in the air when I spoke to her, a sense that I was imparting secrets that would forever change the way she viewed the world.

I felt a thrill of excitement at the prospect of shaping her perceptions, of being the one to introduce her to the complexities and nuances of this foreign land. But it was a double-edged sword, this power to inform and influence. I knew that I was also vulnerable to the same forces, that my own understanding of the world was filtered through the lens of my own experiences and biases. I wondered, as I gazed into Margaret's eager face, how much of what I was telling her was truth, and how much was simply my own interpretation. And I couldn't help but wonder, too, what she would make of it all, what she would take away from our conversations and how it would shape her own worldview. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, a reminder that the power to shape and influence was a weighty responsibility, one that I wasn't sure I was fully equipped to handle."
Graham was adamant about not informing the Ministry about his illness. It was the closest I had,ever seen him to entreating. I thought about it a lot. I liked being entreated by him.,"ever come to understanding the weight of his responsibilities as an Auror, and the toll",34,"ever come to understanding the weight of his responsibilities as an Auror, and the toll it took on his personal life.

"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled. Then again, whose upper management am I not describing? Who trusts their workplace? Who thinks their job is on the side of right?

I didn't know what to make of her, but I knew I had to keep her close, to watch her and wait for her to reveal her true intentions. As we stood there, the tram creaking and swaying in the wind, I felt a sense of unease growing inside me. What was Adela's game? And what would happen if I played along? The questions swirled in my mind, but I knew I had to keep moving forward, to see this through to its conclusion. The prisoners were watching us, their eyes fixed on us with a mixture of hope and despair. I knew I had to make a decision, and fast. But as I looked at Adela, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was walking into a trap, one that would change everything forever."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.","that a man could be in two places at once. I told him it was impossible, but he just shook his head and said",39,"that a man could be in two places at once. I told him it was impossible, but he just shook his head and said I was wrong.

He kept pushing me for answers, and I could see the determination in his eyes. I knew I had to think fast, or he would uncover the truth. So, I took a deep breath and began to spin a web of lies, hoping to confuse him and throw him off the scent. But as I spoke, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was in over my head, and that Graham was getting closer to the truth with every passing moment."
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.","his lips, a look of deep contemplation on his face.

The room was filled with the savory aroma of roasting meat and the sweet, pungent smell of burning tobacco. I could hear the sizzle of food on the stovetop and the soft crackle of the cigarette as he inhaled. Graham looked up as I entered, a hint of a smile on his lips, and I could sense a mix of emotions swirling beneath his calm exterior. The air was thick with tension, and I could tell that something was on his mind, something he was struggling to put into words. I hung my coat on the hook by the door and walked over to the stove, curiosity getting the better of me. ""What's cooking?"" I asked, trying to sound casual despite the sense of foreboding that had settled in the pit of my stomach. Graham's eyes flickered towards the stove, and he took a long drag on his cigarette before answering, his voice low and measured. ""Just a little something I'm trying out,"" he said, his eyes drifting back to the cigarette, his gaze intense. I raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite myself, and walked over to the table to take a seat beside him. The silence that followed was oppressive, heavy with unspoken words and unresolved tensions. I could feel the weight of Graham's gaze on me, but I refused to meet his eyes, instead focusing on the wisps of smoke curling up from the tip of his cigarette. The air was electric with anticipation, and I knew that whatever was coming, it would change everything."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers.

His curiosity was infectious, and soon I found myself explaining the intricacies of nasi lemak and char kway teow, the way the combination of ingredients and spices could evoke a sense of comfort and nostalgia. As we cooked, the aromas wafting from the wok transported me back to my childhood, and I began to see my mother's recipes in a new light. Graham's enthusiasm was a catalyst, and I started to experiment with new flavors and techniques, incorporating the bold spices and fresh herbs of Southeast Asia into our meals. Our kitchen became a laboratory, with Graham as my willing guinea pig, eager to sample each new creation. The more we cooked, the more I realized that food was not just sustenance, but a bridge between cultures and memories, a way to connect with the past and forge new experiences. As the days turned into weeks, our culinary adventures became an integral part of our daily routine, a testament to the power of shared curiosity and creativity."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization. I wanted him in a role that didn’t require him to be at sea for months, possibly years,","at a time. It was too soon, I told myself. Whatever Adela said, he wasn’t ready, he’d barely left London, let alone land. But I wanted him to stay for other reasons too. It was humiliating to know that about myself and to say nothing into his implacable placidity.","so I encouraged him to explore other options.

He eventually landed a job at a local maritime museum, where he could share his knowledge and experience with visitors. I, on the other hand, was determined to find a job that would allow me to use my language skills, so I started applying to translation agencies and language schools. After a few weeks of job hunting, I finally received an offer from a small translation firm that specialized in technical translations. I was thrilled to start working on a wide range of projects, from engineering manuals to scientific articles. As we settled into our new routines, we began to feel more at home in our adopted city. We started taking weekend trips to explore the surrounding countryside, trying new restaurants, and attending local events. Our social circle slowly expanded as we met new people through work and social gatherings. We even started taking language classes to improve our proficiency in the local dialect. It wasn't always easy, but we were determined to make this new life work for us. We had to navigate cultural differences, learn new customs, and adapt to a new way of life, but with each passing day, we felt more confident and more at home."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.","The soulful voice of John Lennon filled the room, a stark contrast to the tense atmosphere that had settled over the group.

Graham, still trying to process the revelation, couldn't help but tap his foot along with the beat. The others, however, remained frozen, their eyes fixed on the figure standing before them. The music seemed to swell, the lyrics taking on a new meaning in the context of their situation. ""You've really got a hold on me,"" Lennon sang, and Graham felt a shiver run down his spine as he realized just how true those words were. They were all in this together now, bound by a shared secret and a growing sense of unease. As the song reached its climax, the group seemed to hold its collective breath, waiting to see what would happen next."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes. One of his first searches was charmingly housewifely: “Most challenging recipes”; “How to make cheese soufflé”; “What is miso paste?”; “Where to buy miso paste”; “How long has Japan been open to Europe?” A day or so after I’d read this report, I received another that listed the following search terms:","and that I would have to confront the reality of his online activities.

The thought sent shivers down my spine as I wondered how I would approach the situation. Would I be forced to have an uncomfortable conversation with him, or could I somehow discreetly guide him towards more wholesome online pursuits? The uncertainty was almost too much to bear. As I sat at my desk, staring blankly at my computer screen, I couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation about what other secrets Graham's online activities might hold. The man who had once been a pillar of the community, a respected figure in our small town, now seemed like a stranger to me. I felt like I was walking on eggshells, never knowing what new revelation might come to light. And yet, despite my reservations, I couldn't help but feel a morbid curiosity about what Graham's search history might reveal. It was as if I was trapped in a never-ending cycle of anticipation and dread, unsure of what the future held, but certain that it would be a wild ride."
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing,","as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday. This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option. We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit. Still, we had not told them about the death camps.","but to me it just looked like a lot of people getting very wet and trying to protect their homes from the rising water.
