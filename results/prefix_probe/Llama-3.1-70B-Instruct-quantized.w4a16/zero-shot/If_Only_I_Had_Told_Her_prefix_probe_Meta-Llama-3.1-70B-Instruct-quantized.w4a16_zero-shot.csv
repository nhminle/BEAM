I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that,"we were crashing at my house, and I felt it was my duty to be the one to take the blows.","the tension between them was palpable, and I didn't want things to escalate further. As we",41,"the tension between them was palpable, and I didn't want things to escalate further. As we walked, I could feel the weight of their unspoken words hanging in the air, like a challenge waiting to be accepted. Autumn's eyes kept drifting towards Jack, her expression a mixture of frustration and longing, while Jack's gaze remained fixed on the path ahead, his jaw clenched in a determined line. I knew I had to tread carefully, to find a way to diffuse the situation before it reached a boiling point. But as we continued on in silence, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was merely delaying the inevitable, that the confrontation that was brewing between them would eventually come to a head, and I would be powerless to stop it."
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.","Autumn—started talking about how they wanted to go on a camping trip together.

At first, I was hesitant, but the more they talked about it, the more excited I became. We started making plans, looking up campsites and checking the weather forecast. Jack even went out and bought a new tent, one that was supposed to be able to withstand even the toughest of weather conditions. Autumn, being the nature lover that she is, started packing all sorts of gear, from hiking boots to a portable stove. I, on the other hand, was more concerned with the food, making sure we had enough snacks and supplies to last us the entire trip. As the days went by, our excitement only grew, and before we knew it, the day of our trip had finally arrived."
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.",My mind starts racing as I hear the sound of footsteps approaching the bed. I try to calm,36,"My mind starts racing as I hear the sound of footsteps approaching the bed. I try to calm myself down, but my heart is beating faster with every step. Jack's voice breaks the silence, 'Hey, are you asleep?' I pretend to be, hoping he'll leave me alone. The blankets feel like my only protection, a fragile barrier between me and the outside world. I hold my breath, waiting for his next move, my senses heightened as I strain to hear what he'll do next. The room is filled with an uncomfortable silence, and I can feel Jack's eyes on me, even with my eyes closed. I wonder what he's thinking, what he wants, and whether I'll be able to avoid him for the rest of the night."
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,"to get up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.

I can tell he's still half asleep, but he's alert enough to sense that something's off. I take a deep breath and try to explain, but before I can get the words out, he's already moving toward the tent. ""Wait, Jack, don't,"" I say, but he's already pushing aside the flap and ducking inside. I follow close behind, my heart racing with anticipation. As we enter the tent, I see that she's still fast asleep, her chest rising and falling with a slow, peaceful rhythm. Jack looks at me, his eyes questioning, and I can tell he's wondering what's going on. I take another deep breath and try to explain, but the words get stuck in my throat. Suddenly, she stirs, her eyes fluttering open as she takes in her surroundings. She looks at us, confused, and then her gaze falls on Jack. A look of recognition crosses her face, followed by a flash of fear. She tries to sit up, but Jack is too quick, gently pushing her back down onto the sleeping bag. ""It's okay,"" he says softly. ""You're safe now."" But as he looks at me, I can tell he's not so sure."
"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with","the word “type.” Autumn makes a noise in the tent, and we both hold our breaths and listen.","e words ""my head.""

""I'm fine, just a bit of a headache,"" he says, though his eyes tell a different story. His gaze drifts off, lost in thought, and I can sense the weight of his worries bearing down on him. I want to reach out, to offer some comfort, but I'm not sure if he'd welcome it. Instead, I sit down beside him, waiting for him to open up, to share whatever's troubling him. The silence between us is heavy, but I'm willing to wait, to be there for him when he's ready to talk."
"“Zoned out the way she does? You have been so, so…","Like last week!” Jack asks, “How could you have missed that game?”","preoccupied lately, and I'm starting to get worried that something's",23,"preoccupied lately, and I'm starting to get worried that something's going on that you're not telling me.

""No way, dude, we've already seen it three times,"" Tom replied, tossing a handful of popcorn into his mouth. ""Besides, I think we've all had enough of superheroes for one night."" The group fell into a comfortable silence, the only sound the soft hum of the TV as it displayed the menu screen. Suddenly, Sarah spoke up, ""You know what? I think I'm going to call it a night. I have an early class tomorrow."" The others nodded in agreement, and soon they were all saying their goodbyes and heading out into the chilly night air."
"I walk Jack to his car, and when he turns to me with that","look on his face, I know what he’s going to say. I open my mouth.","smile, I feel a flutter in my chest that I've grown all too accustomed",29,"smile, I feel a flutter in my chest that I've grown all too accustomed to in his presence. His eyes sparkle with a knowing glint, as if he's aware of the effect he has on me, and for a moment, we just stand there, the tension between us palpable. I try to brush it off, reminding myself that I'm here to see him off, not get caught up in the web of emotions he so effortlessly weaves around me. But as he leans in, his voice low and husky, I feel my resolve begin to crumble. ""Hey, I'll call you later, okay?"" he says, his breath whispering against my ear, sending shivers down my spine. I nod, my voice caught in my throat, and watch as he gets into his car and drives away, leaving me standing there, feeling like I'm drowning in the depths of my own uncertainty."
"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke. Surely the school administrators knew we had always been together, were meant to be together. Surely, if I looked around the cafeteria, she would be there?","together was a different story.

I had always eaten with Autumn, and now I was forced to navigate the cafeteria alone. Jack, however, was easy to talk to, and we quickly discovered a shared love for video games and science fiction novels. As we sat down at a table near the window, I couldn't help but notice the way the sunlight highlighted the freckles on his nose. Autumn, on the other hand, was sitting with a group of girls from her math class, laughing and chatting like they had known each other for years. I felt a pang of jealousy, but Jack's friendly smile drew me back in. We spent the rest of lunch discussing our favorite books and debating the merits of different superhero franchises. By the time the bell rang, signaling the end of lunch, I felt like I had known Jack for years. As we walked out of the cafeteria, Jack turned to me and said, ""Hey, want to sit together on the bus ride home?"" I agreed, and we exchanged numbers, making plans to meet up at the bus stop after school. Little did I know, this chance encounter would be the start of a lifelong friendship."
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time.

Now, as we sat together, he turned to me with an easy smile and asked how I was doing. I replied that I was doing all right, and he nodded thoughtfully, his eyes crinkling at the corners. We chatted for a bit about nothing in particular, exchanging small talk about the class and our shared dislike of the teacher's gruff demeanor. As we talked, I found myself feeling more and more at ease in his presence, which was a welcome change from the awkwardness I'd been experiencing all morning. Before I knew it, we'd been chatting for a good 20 minutes, and the table was starting to fill up with other students. Jack glanced around, seeming to take in the growing crowd, and then turned back to me with a mischievous glint in his eye. ""Hey, want to grab some lunch together?"" he asked, his voice low and casual. I hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to say, but something about his friendly demeanor put me at ease. ""Sure,"" I said finally, smiling back at him. And just like that, we pushed our chairs back and headed out of the cafeteria, leaving the noise and chaos behind us."
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.","he looked at me with a mixture of confusion and curiosity.

Autumn, however, seemed completely at ease, her smile unwavering as she walked towards us. ""It's great to finally meet you, Jack,"" she said, her voice warm and friendly. Jack's eyes darted back to me, and I could sense his unspoken questions. I knew I had to fill him in on the details, but I wasn't sure where to start. Autumn, sensing the awkwardness, jumped in, ""So, Jack, what do you think of our little town so far?"" Her question broke the tension, and Jack launched into a conversation about his experiences since arriving. As they talked, I couldn't help but notice the way Autumn's eyes sparkled when she laughed, and the way Jack's face lit up when he spoke about his passions. It was clear that they were going to get along just fine."
"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face. He didn’t believe that Autumn was—or ever had been—my friend. The daughter of my mom’s best friend, who was around a lot? Sure. But he thought I had deluded myself into believing this hot girl was my friend.","his face, a mixture of sadness and concern that made me feel like I was the one who needed help, not him.

As I watched him walk up the path to his front door, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had let him down in some way. The drive back to my place was quiet, with only the sound of the engine and the occasional passing car breaking the silence. I was lost in thought, replaying the events of the night over and over in my head, trying to make sense of it all. When I finally pulled into my driveway, I sat in the car for a few minutes, collecting my thoughts before getting out and heading inside. The house was dark and empty, just like my mood. I wandered aimlessly from room to room, trying to find something to distract me from the thoughts that were swirling in my head. But no matter what I did, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that something had shifted in a way that I couldn't quite put my finger on. It wasn't until I finally collapsed onto the couch, exhausted and emotionally drained, that I realized what it was - I had seen a side of Jack that I had never seen before, a side that made me question everything I thought I knew about him. And as I drifted off to sleep, I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets he might be hiding."
"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.","lined the walls, and the scent of pumpkin spice wafted through the air.

I baked pies and made warm apple cider, all in an attempt to show Jack that Autumn was a season to be cherished. I took him on hayrides and to the local pumpkin patch, where we picked out the perfect gourds to carve. I even convinced him to join me for a bonfire on a crisp October night, where we roasted marshmallows and swapped scary stories. And as the leaves changed colors and the air grew cooler, I could see the magic of the season slowly winning Jack over. He began to appreciate the way the sunlight filtered through the trees, casting a warm glow over everything, and the way the stars shone brightly in the night sky. By the time the first snowflakes started to fall, Jack had come to see Autumn in a whole new light, and I had proved to myself that even the most stubborn of people could be won over with a little bit of persistence and a lot of heart."
"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still","friends. On the last day of school before winter break, Jack finally said something. I cannot remember what I had been telling him, only that it had been about Autumn.","friends.

It had been months, and the conversation had been strained, to say the least. We had been drifting apart for a while, and I had been too caught up in my own life to notice. But now, as I looked back, I realized that our friendship had been slowly unraveling for years. I thought about all the times we had promised to stay in touch, to meet up, to be there for each other, but somehow, life had gotten in the way. And now, as I stood there, trying to convince this stranger that Autumn and I were still friends, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was lying to myself. Were we still friends? I didn't know. All I knew was that I missed her, and I wanted to reconnect, to go back to the way things used to be. But as I looked into the stranger's skeptical eyes, I wondered if it was already too late."
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah? Let’s take this outside,” and hurried me out.","to start rambling on about how he had forgotten his math homework or something, but instead he just blurted out that he had",41,"to start rambling on about how he had forgotten his math homework or something, but instead he just blurted out that he had seen a ghost in the school hallway.

""I was walking down the hall, and I saw this...this figure,"" he whispered. ""It was tall and gaunt, with eyes that glowed like embers. It was staring right at me."" I felt a shiver run down my spine as Jack's words painted a vivid picture in my mind. I had always been skeptical of ghost stories, but there was something about Jack's demeanor that made me wonder if he was telling the truth. ""Where did you see it?"" I asked, my curiosity getting the better of me. Jack hesitated before answering, ""In front of the old classroom. You know, the one that's been closed off for years?"" I nodded, my mind racing with possibilities. We had all heard rumors about that classroom being haunted, but I had never thought much of it. Now, I wasn't so sure."
"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind","yourself, ‘Autumn is where she wants to be right now, and that’s okay. I’m still great, and I’ll be around if she needs me.’ Hmm?” She squeezed my foot again.","yourself of all the things you're good at and the people who care about you.

We could go for a run, or I could help you with your homework, or we could just hang out and watch a movie. What sounds good to you?"
"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly.

I had to learn to control my emotions, to stay focused under pressure, and to think on my feet. As I continued to play, I began to realize that the skills I was developing on the field were translating to other areas of my life as well. I was becoming more confident, more resilient, and more determined. I started to see that the pursuit of coolness wasn't just about external validation, but about cultivating a sense of inner strength and self-assurance. And with that realization, I felt a sense of freedom, like I could finally be myself without apology. I was no longer trying to fit into someone else's idea of cool, but instead, I was forging my own path, one that was authentic and true to who I was. As I looked back on my journey, I realized that the quest for coolness had been a catalyst for growth, a journey of self-discovery that had led me to a place of greater self-awareness and acceptance."
"Jack and I had worried one of us might not make it on the junior varsity team. When the lists were posted,","I searched for my name on the JV list and was devastated to not see it. Still, I was happy for Jack.","we both felt a mix of relief and excitement as we scanned the names, our eyes widening as we found our",44,"we both felt a mix of relief and excitement as we scanned the names, our eyes widening as we found our own among the selected players.

Now, with the uncertainty behind us, we could finally look forward to the season ahead, eager to learn from our mistakes, push ourselves to new heights, and make the most of this opportunity to grow as athletes and as a team. As we walked away from the posted lists, we exchanged a look of mutual congratulations, already planning our strategies for the upcoming games and the hard work that lay ahead."

From that point on, Jack made a conscious effort to get to know me better and understand my perspective, which ultimately led to a more harmonious and productive collaboration. As we worked together on various projects, I began to appreciate Jack's dry sense of humor and his ability to find the humor in even the most mundane situations. Our working relationship evolved into a strong and supportive partnership, one that was built on mutual respect and trust."
"The varsity soccer team practiced on the north field, near the student parking lots.

Meanwhile, the junior varsity team, comprised of younger and less experienced players, was overseen by Coach Lee, who focused on developing their fundamental skills. As the two teams practiced, the sounds of laughter, shouts, and thudding soccer balls filled the air, creating an energetic atmosphere that was quintessentially high school. The sun beat down on the fields, casting a warm glow over the proceedings, and the smell of freshly cut grass wafted through the air, invigorating the senses. Despite the differences in skill level, both teams shared a common goal: to improve with each passing day and make their school proud."
"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me. I was excited to tell him that practice hadn’t been as hard as I thought.,"that I was going to stick around for a bit to get some extra work in.

I took a deep breath, the cool evening air filling my lungs, and began to run drills, my footsteps echoing off the empty seats. As I worked, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched, and I glanced up to see a figure standing in the shadows near the entrance of the stadium. I squinted, trying to make out who it was, but they didn't move or respond. I shrugged it off and continued my training, the silence and solitude allowing me to focus on my game. The figure remained there, motionless, as I ran and sweated and pushed myself to my limits. Eventually, I called it a night, exhausted but satisfied with the progress I'd made. As I walked off the field, the figure finally stirred, stepping forward into the light. It was our team's coach, a stern expression etched on his face. ""You're putting in extra work, I like that,"" he said, his voice low and gravelly. ""But you need to work smarter, not just harder. Meet me in my office tomorrow and we'll go over some game footage."" With that, he turned and disappeared into the night, leaving me to wonder what he had seen in my performance that I hadn't."
"We all joined Jack on the low wall, waiting to get picked up. We didn’t talk that much, but the next day, as I trudged from the north field to","the south, I saw the girls by the gym door again.

The question hung in the air, a reminder of the uncertainty that had been lingering in our minds for weeks. We continued walking in silence, the only sound being the rustling of the wind through the crops. The sun beat down on us, relentless in its intensity, a constant reminder of the long days that lay ahead. As we reached the south field, Jack slowed down, his gaze fixed on something in the distance. I followed his line of sight, and my heart skipped a beat as I saw a figure standing by the fence, watching us. Who was it, and what did they want? The questions swirled in my mind as we approached the mysterious figure, our footsteps heavy with anticipation."

What if she had walked all the way back to the village, alone, in the dark, with only her thoughts for company. What if she had walked, and walked, and walked, until the sun rose, and the world was a new and different place, and she was a new and different person. What if she had walked, and left me behind, sleeping, dreaming, unaware. What if she had walked, and never looked back."
"It strikes me how backward my plan sounds: give up a girl who adores me, who I love well enough, to be a disciple for a different girl who will","never fall for me.

I imagine the way she might smile at me, the way her eyes might light up when I'm near, and it's enough to make me question everything I thought I knew about love and relationships. I know it's a risk, that I could end up hurt and alone, but a part of me is willing to take that chance, to see if there's something more out there for me. The problem is, I have no idea how to make it happen, or if it's even possible.

As she lies there, she becomes aware of the creaks and groans of the old house, the way the wind whispers through the trees outside, and the faint hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen. It's as if the house itself is watching her, waiting for something to happen."
"“It just felt so nice not to be the weird girl anymore,”",Autumn says. “I liked being popular. We did kinda grow apart that year.”,I could finally blend in with the crowd and not have people staring at me,25,"“I could finally blend in with the crowd and not have people staring at me all the time.

I felt alive, like I was finally a part of the world around me, and it was an incredible feeling.”"
“I don’t like him.” I shrugged. “I told you before: Autumn’s an old friend from when we were kids. Sucks that she,"likes such a show-off.” I shrugged again. Up ahead, Autumn and her friends were waiting at the crosswalk for the light to change.","ended up with him, but that doesn't change how I feel about her.

I've tried to be civil with him for her sake, but it's not easy. There's just something about him that rubs me the wrong way. Maybe it's the way he always seems to be trying too hard to fit in, or the way he looks at Autumn like she's some kind of prize he's won. Whatever it is, I've learned to keep my opinions to myself and just be happy that Autumn seems happy. But sometimes, like now, my true feelings manage to slip out, and I worry that I've said too much."
My face must change because she smiles and clambers into my lap. We wrap our arms around each other and settle in.,"After a moment, she says, “You know, I never thought this would happen either. When Jack told me—” and then she stops.","The warmth of her body seeps into mine, and I feel a sense of calm wash over me.

In this quiet moment, I feel a deep connection to this little being, and my heart swells with love and gratitude. As we sit there, the silence between us is filled with a sense of comfort and understanding, a sense of being exactly where we're meant to be."
"“Sorry,” I say. “I was trying to decide whether I should kill Jack for telling you I was",into you or if I should kill him for telling you that I wasn’t into you.

I look at you, and I can see the confusion and curiosity in your eyes. You're waiting for me to finish my sentence, to reveal the truth that Jack has so carelessly spilled out. I take a deep breath, trying to decide how much to reveal, and how much to keep hidden. Do I tell you the truth, and risk losing you forever, or do I lie, and hope that you never find out? The decision is not an easy one, and I can feel my heart racing as I weigh my options. I look at Jack, who is watching us with a mixture of concern and amusement, clearly enjoying the drama that he has created. I shoot him a warning glance, but he just shrugs and looks away, leaving me to deal with the fallout. I turn back to you, and take another deep breath, trying to find the right words to say."
"“Yeah,” I admit. Jack was protecting me, but there’s no way he believed that I was over Autumn. I’m wondering now though. “What would","you have done if he’d told you the truth, that I was”—I try to remember how Jack put it before—“bonkers in love with you?”","you have done to make him think that?""

""I told him about the way you've been acting,"" he says finally, his voice low and measured. ""The way you've been pushing everyone away, including me. I told him that you're still hurting, that you're not ready to move on."" I feel a pang of guilt at his words, knowing that he's right. I have been pushing people away, trying to protect myself from getting hurt again. But hearing him say it out loud makes me realize that I've been doing it for too long. It's time to face my feelings and deal with them, rather than trying to suppress them. ""What did he say?"" I ask, my voice barely above a whisper. ""He said that he's willing to wait for you, to give you the time and space you need,"" he replies, his eyes never leaving mine. ""But he also said that he's not going to give up on you, that he's going to be there for you whenever you're ready."" I feel a lump form in my throat as I process his words, a mix of emotions swirling inside me. I'm not sure what to say or do, but I know that I need to think about it, to figure out what I really want."
"“I think my mother has a special bottle of champagne hidden away for just this occasion,” I say. I’m only partially joking. Mom has labeled some of her alcohol, like","for when George W.

I make a mental note to snoop around the kitchen later and see if I can find it. In the meantime, I grab a few beers from the fridge and head back outside to join the party. As I hand out the drinks, I notice that the music has changed and people are starting to dance. The sun is setting, casting a warm orange glow over the whole scene, and for a moment, everything feels perfect. I take a deep breath, feeling grateful for this little slice of happiness, and let the music wash over me."

Maybe it's the way she looks at me, with an intensity that makes my skin prickle, or maybe it's the way she says it, like she's daring me to contradict her. Whatever it is, I find myself wanting to trust her, to trust that she knows something I don't, something that will make all of this make sense."

Syl notices my gaze wandering and follows it, her eyes scanning the space as if searching for something. Suddenly, she gasps and points to a small, almost imperceptible mark on the wall. ""What's that?"" she asks, her voice barely above a whisper. I follow her finger, and my heart skips a beat as I realize what she's found."
"“Syl,” I say as I drive toward her house, speeding up a bit. “Don’t be ridiculous.",I’ve been enough of a bastard already.

You’re just going to run away with your tail between your legs, aren’t you? Don’t be ridiculous, Syl. You’re not even thinking about the consequences of your actions. You’re just acting on impulse, like you always do. But this time, it’s not just about you. It’s about us, and our future together. So, please, just calm down and think this through. Let’s talk about this like adults, not like a couple of teenagers who can’t even have a rational conversation.”"
"“Lexy,” I say. It’s too fucking early for her to call.

I hesitate for a moment, wondering if I should just let it go to voicemail, but my curiosity gets the better of me. I swipe to answer, trying to sound more alert than I feel. ""Hey, Lexy. What's up?"" I say, trying to keep my tone neutral. There's a pause on the other end of the line, and for a moment, I wonder if the call dropped. But then Lexy's voice comes through, sounding hesitant and unsure. ""Hey, I'm so sorry to call you so early,"" she says. ""I know you're not a morning person, but I really need to talk to you about something."" My instincts start to kick in, and I can feel a sense of unease growing in the pit of my stomach.

My mother takes a deep breath, then pushes the door open, revealing a room filled with people in white coats, all of whom turn to look at us as we enter.

I take a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, and slowly make my way to our room. As I approach the door, I can hear the sound of the TV and Brett's laughter, and my heart skips a beat. I pause for a moment, wondering if I should announce my presence or just walk in. I decide to just walk in, hoping to catch him off guard and gauge his reaction. I slowly turn the handle and push the door open, my eyes scanning the room for Brett. He's sitting on the couch, his eyes fixed on the TV, and a bowl of popcorn in his lap. He looks up, startled, and our eyes meet. For a moment, we just stare at each other, the tension between us palpable."

His mind begins to wander, imagining the thrill of the open road, the rush of adrenaline as he speeds down the highway, the wind whipping through his hair, and the freedom to go wherever he pleases. The sound of the teacher's voice, droning on about historical dates and events, becomes a distant hum, a reminder that he's stuck in this seat, trapped in a world of monotony, until the bell rings, signaling his escape."
"“You won’t,” Brett says. He looks directly at me from across the table,","his food forgotten. He’s so certain. “You won’t forget. You’ll never forget,” he says.",his eyes locked intensely on mine as if daring me to contradict him. The air in the room,27,"his eyes locked intensely on mine as if daring me to contradict him. The air in the room seems to thicken, heavy with unspoken words and unresolved tension. I can feel my heart beating faster, my palms growing sweaty as I try to process the weight of his statement. The silence between us stretches out, a palpable thing that presses against my skin, making it hard to breathe. I try to speak, to form some kind of response, but my voice catches in my throat, refusing to emerge. Brett's gaze never wavers, his expression unyielding, as if he's waiting for me to acknowledge some unspoken truth."

As she sat in stunned silence, the beeping of the machines and the soft murmur of the hospital staff seemed to fade into the background, replaced by the haunting question that echoed in her mind: what could have driven her friend to such a desperate act?"
"“If I didn’t offer, then I should have been guilted,” I say. “I’m telling","you, Sylv, I really should have said something after I saw her last weekend.”","you, I was raised to be polite, and it’s just good manners to offer someone a",28,"you, I was raised to be polite, and it’s just good manners to offer someone a place to stay when they need it.

But it's too late now, the offer's been made, and I'm not about to take it back. I just hope I don't end up regretting this decision."
"“Yeah, she slept in a little, so when it was time to take Dave to school, I went to the crib, and she was so still, I really thought that she wasn’t breathing.

I was so relieved that she was okay, but at the same time, I was still trying to process what had just happened. I mean, I've heard of babies sleeping a lot, but this was on a whole different level. I gently placed her in her car seat, and we headed out the door to drop off Dave. The whole time, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. I kept looking back at her, making sure she was still breathing, still alive. When we got to the school, I was a bit distracted, and Dave noticed it. ""Dad, what's wrong?"" he asked, looking up at me with those big brown eyes. I hesitated for a moment before responding, ""Nothing, buddy, just a little tired, that's all."" But the truth was, I was worried. I was worried about my little girl, and I couldn't wait to get her to the doctor to make sure everything was okay."
"Once she is free, the baby stops crying, but seemingly only out of confusion. “Beba?” She waits for me to do something, but I don’t","know what to do, so I continue to hold her from under her armpits out in front of me. “Meh?” she tries again and whimpers.","know what to do.

To my surprise, she starts to calm down, her tiny chest rising and falling with each breath. I continue to rock her, trying to make sense of the situation. Who is this baby, and why is she here? And what does she mean by ""Beba""? Is that her name, or something else entirely? I look around the room again, this time searching for any clues that might explain what's going on. That's when I notice a small piece of paper on the floor, partially hidden under the couch cushion. I carefully set the baby down on the couch and retrieve the paper, hoping it might hold some answers."

I tried to hold on to the memories of our laughter, our adventures, our quiet nights in, but they seemed to be slipping away from me like sand between my fingers. I knew I couldn't give up, not yet, but the thought of continuing on this path, of fighting for a love that seemed to be fading, was exhausting. I felt like I was losing myself in the process, like I was disappearing into the void of our relationship. I didn't know how much more of this I could take, how much more of myself I could lose."

He's translucent, with a soft blue glow surrounding his edges. I've never seen a ghost up close before, and I'm both fascinated and terrified. The hostess hands us menus, and I take a deep breath, trying to focus on the task at hand. ""So, uh, what's good here?"" I ask, trying to sound casual. The ghost chuckles and leans in, his voice barely above a whisper. ""The specials are always a good choice,"" he says, his eyes sparkling with mischief. I raise an eyebrow, intrigued despite myself. Who is this ghost, and why did he ask me out on a date? And what exactly does one order at a restaurant when one's dinner companion is dead?"
"The waitress is suddenly there, and I’m agreeing to lemon in my water and being handed a menu that looks like a wedding invitation.

John beats me to it, confidently rattling off his choice of the filet mignon, cooked medium rare. I hesitate for a moment before opting for the salmon, hoping that it will be a lighter option after the rich appetizers we shared earlier. The waitress nods and takes our menus, leaving us to sit in comfortable silence as we await the arrival of our meals."

His words send a shiver down my spine as I realize that this is more than just a casual lunch meeting.

My laugh makes the tears spill but also stops more from forming. I touch my fingertips to my eyes for the sake of my,mascara and look back at John.

The laughter has stopped, and all that's left is the raw, unbridled emotion that I've been trying to keep at bay for so long.
