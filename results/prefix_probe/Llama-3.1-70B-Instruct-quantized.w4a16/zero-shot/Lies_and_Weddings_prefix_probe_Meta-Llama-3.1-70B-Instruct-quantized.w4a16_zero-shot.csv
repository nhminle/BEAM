I'm guessing it's happened more times than she can count, and that's why she seems so calm and collected right now. It's like she's learned to just roll with it and wait for the storm to pass. But despite her tough exterior, I can tell she's worried about what's going to happen next. She keeps glancing over at Mum, who's still shouting at the top of her lungs, and I can see the concern etched on her face. It's clear that she loves her mum, but she's also frustrated with her behaviour and feels helpless to do anything about it."

"They approached the altar positioned at the edge of the cliff and gazed out at the dramatic view of the Kona coastline just as the sun was dipping into the ocean.

The air was electric with anticipation as the group of onlookers watched in awe, their faces aglow with the golden light of the setting sun. As Gopal Das's chanting grew louder and more fervent, the wind began to pick up, whipping the participants' hair into a frenzy and sending their loose clothing billowing behind them. The atmosphere was one of primal, unbridled energy, as if the very elements themselves were being summoned forth by the shaman's wild incantations. Suddenly, a loud crack of thunder boomed through the air, making everyone jump, and a brilliant flash of lightning illuminated the darkening sky. The group gasped in unison, their eyes fixed on Gopal Das, who stood tall and unwavering, his staff raised high above his head. The moment was one of pure, unadulterated magic, a moment that would be etched in the memories of all who witnessed it for a lifetime."
"Gopal Das tucked the tight white tee that showed off his sinewy pecs into his camo-green cargo shorts and said, “Close your eyes. Now breathe","in deeply…. Let your first chakra connect with the ground, rooting in the earth, connecting with Gaia, connecting with spirit.

Stay close and watch your step – the terrain can get tricky in some spots. Ready to take on the day?"

""We need to keep moving,"" he added, his voice low and urgent, ""we can't stay here for long."" The trees seemed to loom over them, casting long, ominous shadows on the ground, and the air was heavy with the scent of decay and death. Thomas's companion, a young woman with a look of determination etched on her face, nodded silently, her eyes scanning their surroundings with a mixture of fear and caution. She knew that they were being hunted, and that their only hope for survival lay in putting as much distance between themselves and their pursuers as possible. The silence between them was oppressive, punctuated only by the sound of their footsteps and the distant howl of a wolf, a haunting reminder of the dangers that lurked in the darkness."

I'm just glad to be alive, even if my nerves are still on edge. I need a stiff drink after that ordeal. Or maybe two. Or perhaps an entire bottle. Anything to calm my racing heart and shake off the feeling of impending doom that's been following me since we descended into that fiery abyss."
*3 Although “cottage” could be rather misleading for the spacious four-bedroom house with a thatched roof,"that was decomposing so perfectly, Thomas was constantly finding DIY influencers taking selfies by the garden gate.","that stood proudly on the outskirts of the village, its name had been passed down through generations, evoking a sense",33,"that stood proudly on the outskirts of the village, its name had been passed down through generations, evoking a sense of warmth and coziness that was hard to shake off. The house had been in the family for over a century, and its rustic charm had been carefully preserved through the years, with its original wooden beams and stone fireplace still intact. Despite its size, the house had a way of making you feel like you were stepping into a different era, one where life was simpler and more peaceful. The thatched roof, which had been recently restored, added to the house's quaint charm, and the surrounding gardens, filled with wildflowers and tall trees, seemed to stretch on forever."
"*4 Though Arabella was raised speaking the Queen’s English in what was then the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong and spoke with the poshest of accents, whenever she came into contact with other Asians—particularly","family members and service people—her accent would take on the inflections and sentence structuring that were peculiar to upper-crust Hong Kongers.

It was as if her body had a mind of its own, instinctively responding to the familiar sounds and rhythms of the languages that had surrounded her during those formative years. This phenomenon was not unique to Arabella, of course; many people who had grown up in multicultural environments experienced similar linguistic shifts, often without even realizing it. But for Arabella, this ability to code-switch with such ease was both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it allowed her to connect with people from diverse backgrounds and navigate complex social situations with greater ease. On the other hand, it made her feel like she didn't quite belong anywhere, like she was perpetually stuck between different worlds and identities. As she navigated the challenges of adulthood, Arabella found herself grappling with this sense of disconnection, searching for a way to reconcile her multiple selves and find a sense of true belonging."
"“That’s because I’m the only one around here who eats carbs,” Eden said as she took","a bite of her chocolate croissant, still warm from the oven. “You really ought to try one.”","a large bite of her sandwich, the crunch of the crust and the softness of the bread a welcome",33,"a large bite of her sandwich, the crunch of the crust and the softness of the bread a welcome respite from the protein-heavy meals that dominated the cafeteria's menu.

""You know, Eden, you're going to turn into a carb one of these days,"" her friend Rachel joked, shaking her head in mock dismay. Eden just rolled her eyes good-naturedly and continued eating, the satisfying taste of her lunch a small but significant pleasure in an otherwise chaotic day."
"Suddenly Arabella’s eyes lit up and she seemed to recover slightly. “Yes, she will be good","for OS, won’t she? Eden, you’ll offer your assistance, won’t you, in our time of need?”","for the role,” Arabella said, a hint of her usual enthusiasm returning to her voice. “I",32,"for the role,” Arabella said, a hint of her usual enthusiasm returning to her voice. “I can see it now – the way she’ll bring the character to life, the way she’ll connect with the audience. We just need to work on a few things, help her tap into her full potential.” She began to pace back and forth, her mind already racing with ideas and possibilities. “I can see it, I can see it all coming together. We’ll make this production one to remember, mark my words.”"

"“The older woman said, ‘Excuse me, do you speak English?’ I was used to this question, so I simply nodded. The younger woman said, ‘We see you here every day. You’re so good with the baby. She clearly adores you.’ ‘Thank you,’ I replied. And then","the older woman leaned over and whispered, ‘Whatever they’re paying you, we’ll double it.’ I was so confused, and then it hit me: These women think I’m the nanny!

The younger woman smiled and said, 'We've seen the way you care for your own child, and we think you would be perfect. Plus, it would be nice to have someone to talk to who speaks English.' I thought about it for a moment, weighing the pros and cons. On one hand, it would be nice to have some extra income and get out of the house for a bit. On the other hand, I wasn't sure if I was ready to take on the responsibility of caring for someone else's child. 'I'd be happy to help out,' I said finally, 'but I need to discuss it with my partner first.' The women nodded understandingly and we exchanged numbers, making plans to meet up the following week to discuss the details. As I watched them walk away, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and nervousness about the potential new opportunity."
"Arabella credits her own mother for her confidence to upend centuries of tradition. “My mother grew up in Shanghai, which was the Paris of the East, so for her, Asian Fusion wasn’t a fad, it was a way of life.” Arabella’s barrister father","hailed from one of Hong Kong’s most respected legal families. “People are constantly surprised to learn that I didn’t grow up in a rice paddy.

Her parents' influence, combined with her own innate curiosity, led her to experiment with innovative flavor combinations, earning her a reputation as a trailblazer in the culinary world. Arabella's restaurant, Mosaic, quickly gained a loyal following, with patrons drawn to its vibrant atmosphere and bold, East-meets-West cuisine. Critics praised her dishes, such as the signature ""Szechuan Bouillabaisse,"" which married the spicy, numbing flavors of Szechuan pepper with the rich, seafood flavors of the classic French stew. As Arabella's star continued to rise, she remained committed to her vision of a culinary world without borders, where flavors and techniques from different cultures could come together in exciting, unexpected ways."
"The countess never imagined that her modern spin on Marco Polo would spawn her own design and hospitality empire, but after a famously finicky Qatari prince spent the weekend and was wowed by the countess’s hospitality, he commanded her to design a hotel in London “for people who can only bear to stay in palaces when they travel,” promising to book out","the entire place every year for the London Season.

She had been traveling for days, and the long hours of driving had finally caught up with her. As she slowly sat up in bed, the morning light streaming through the window highlighted the dust motes dancing in the air. The cottage, though quaint, was cozy, and Eden felt a sense of peace wash over her as she took in her surroundings. She had rented the place for a month, hoping to find some solace in the quiet, rural setting. The owner, an elderly woman named Mrs. Jenkins, had warned her about the early bird chorus, but Eden hadn't expected it to be so... lively. She smiled to herself, feeling a sense of wonder at the unfamiliar sounds. After a quick wash with cold water from the tap, Eden got dressed in comfortable clothes and headed outside to explore her new surroundings. The air was crisp and clean, filled with the scent of blooming flowers and fresh grass. She took a deep breath, feeling invigorated, and set off towards the nearby woods, eager to discover the secrets they held."

The path was treacherous, winding its way up the mountain with steep drop-offs and loose gravel that threatened to send her tumbling at every turn. Despite the challenges, Eden pressed on, her determination driving her forward. She had been warned about the dangers of this route, but she had to see it for herself, to experience the beauty and the thrill that it promised. As she climbed higher, the air grew cooler and the trees gave way to scrubby bushes and rocky outcroppings. Eden's breath came in ragged gasps, but she didn't slow down, her eyes fixed on the summit rising above her. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the trees ahead, its features indistinct in the fading light. Eden's heart quickened as she wondered who - or what - it could be."

Eden replied with a gentle ""morning"" and began preparing her own coffee, trying to shake off the remnants of sleep. The morning sunlight streaming through the window highlighted the dust particles dancing in the air, and for a moment, Eden felt a sense of peace wash over her.

“Why? Are you going to the Wolseley? Look how I’m dressed.” Rufus gestured to his tattered board shorts and bare feet as they cut through a wooded path that led from the beach to a road that to Eden seemed straight out of a dream.

Eden's eyes widened as she took in the vibrant colors of the market stalls, the sounds of laughter and music carrying on the air. Rufus, noticing her fascination, smiled wryly and nodded towards the stalls. ""Welcome to the real Bali,"" he said, his voice low and husky. ""Not the one they show in the brochures."" Eden's curiosity was piqued, and she quickened her pace, eager to explore this hidden gem. As they wandered through the stalls, Eden marveled at the intricate carvings and colorful textiles, the vendors calling out to her in a language she didn't understand.

"“Puako Beach Road is one of the only places left on the entire island that still has these original cottages from the sixties right on the beach,” Rufus","explained. “It’s a real neighborhood, as opposed to some poncy resort.

Rufus's words hung in the air, a poignant reminder of the delicate balance between progress and preservation that the island's residents and visitors alike must navigate. The sound of the waves gently lapping at the shore seemed to underscore the importance of his message, a soothing melody that had been a constant companion to the people who called this enchanting place home. As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the beach, Rufus's thoughts turned to the future, and the role he hoped to play in safeguarding the island's rich cultural heritage for generations to come."
Rufus gestured outside. On one end of the back deck was an outdoor shower nestled between thick tropical bushes and a,wall of stacked volcanic rocks.

Arabella nodded. “She is one of the hottest emerging artists around.

She took another sip of her coffee, the bitterness a stark contrast to the sweetness of the memories she and her sister used to share. As she stood there, lost in thought, a gentle breeze carried the whispers of seagulls, a melancholic serenade that seemed to echo the turmoil brewing within her."

""You guys are lifesavers,"" she said, giving them a warm hug. ""I was starting to think I'd have to wear that old black dress again, and I just couldn't bear the thought of it."" Rachel chuckled, remembering the countless times Bea had worn that dress to previous events. ""We couldn't let that happen, could we?"" she said with a grin.

Her sister, the owner of the questionable garment, looked on sheepishly, a mixture of embarrassment and defiance etched on her face. ""Hey, it was on sale,"" she protested, as if that was somehow a valid excuse for the fashion atrocity that hung before them. Arabella just rolled her eyes and shook her head, ""You're not actually going to wear that, are you?"""

Can we take a break and grab some fresh air?"" Rachel nodded, and they both stood up, walking towards the park's lake. The sound of birds chirping and water lapping against the shore was a welcome respite from the tension that had been building up inside Eden. As they strolled along the water's edge, Rachel turned to her and asked, ""Do you think he's trying to tell me something? Or is he just messing with me?"" Eden hesitated, unsure of how to respond.

But we'll figure it out together, okay?"" Rachel smiled weakly, and Eden could see the desperation in her eyes.

Rachel nodded, and they headed towards the café, ready to dive back into the mystery that had been plaguing them for hours."

I couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt for not considering his feelings earlier. As we set off, Freddy trudged along behind me, his eyes fixed on the deck rather than the horizon. The captain, a grizzled old sailor with a bushy white beard, greeted us warmly and began to explain the day's itinerary.

"No sooner had Rufus said this than a now-familiar roar filled the air and Freddy’s fantastical boat pulled up to the dock.

Meanwhile, the others were busy exploring the cabin, marveling at the plush leather seats, the polished wooden accents, and the stunning views of the surrounding waters through the large windows. As they set off, the boat glided smoothly across the waves, leaving a trail of glittering foam in its wake. The group chatted and laughed, enjoying the warm sunshine and the cool ocean breeze, feeling carefree and exhilarated by the adventure that lay ahead. As they sailed further out to sea, the landscape shifted, and the sounds of the city gave way to the cries of seagulls and the rhythmic lapping of the waves against the hull. Freddy, ever the gracious host, offered them refreshing drinks and snacks, and they settled in for a leisurely cruise, savoring the beauty of the ocean and each other's company."

The grand duchess smiled to herself, clearly pleased with the drama that was unfolding. She had always known that Arabella was a force to be reckoned with, but this was a new level of cunning. As the music began again, the grand duchess made her way through the crowds, her eyes fixed on the young woman who had just become her new rival."

The sun was beginning to set, casting a warm orange glow over the landscape, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers. As they stood at the edge of the cliff, the wind whipping their hair into a frenzy, Eden felt a sense of exhilaration wash over her. She had always loved heights, and this was the most breathtaking view she had ever seen. The curve of the horizon stretched out before them, a perfect arc of blue meeting the sky. In the distance, the tiny dots of cars and buildings looked like miniature toys, and the sound of the wind rushing past was almost deafening. Eden's friend, Rachel, finally managed to get the camera settings just right and snapped a photo, capturing the moment forever. As they stood there, taking in the view, Eden felt grateful for this adventure and the friend by her side to share it with."
"Just as Eden was about to continue protesting, the sound of heraldic trumpets echoed through the great hall. A dozen trumpeters dressed in full regalia entered, and then from both ends of the hall, hundreds","of Nordic men in traditional folk costumes and ice skates glided around an ice track along the outer perimeter of the space, each bearing silver trays laden with glasses.

Eden's protests were forgotten in the excitement of the moment, and she found herself being swept up in the tide of expectation. As the last of the guests took their seats, a hush fell over the assembly, and a figure emerged from the shadows. It was the king, resplendent in his finest attire, his eyes gleaming with a mixture of warmth and authority. He raised his hands, and the hall fell silent, awaiting his words. The moment was ripe with possibility, and Eden felt her heart pounding in her chest as she wondered what the king would say next."
"“Sure looks like it,” Eden said as one of the floppy-haired waiters skated up and placed a tall fluted glass filled with a frothy dark liquid","in front of her. She took a sip of the warm, rich broth and realized it was the first course—wild foraged mushroom cappuccino with white truffle froth.","in front of her.

The sounds of the rink filled the air, the scraping of blades on ice and the murmur of conversation from the other patrons. I took a sip of the hot chocolate, feeling the warmth spread through my hands as I cradled the glass. Eden watched me, a small smile playing on her lips. ""So, what do you think?"" she asked, nodding towards the rink. I followed her gaze, watching as a group of kids stumbled and giggled their way across the ice. ""It's...fun,"" I said finally, feeling a little silly. Eden laughed, a throaty sound that made me smile. ""I'm glad you think so,"" she said, her eyes sparkling with amusement. We sat there in comfortable silence for a moment, sipping our hot chocolate and watching the skaters. It was...nice. A feeling I wasn't used to, but one I couldn't help but enjoy."
"Rufus sighed. “A fairy tale? Everything about this is wrong. This ice palace was supposed to be half the size and built at the resort, not up here.

But for now, I'm stuck in this frozen monstrosity, surrounded by nothing but snow and ice. And to make matters worse, I think I just saw a yeti out of the corner of my eye. This is not my day."

"Eden stood under the shower on Rufus’s back deck, feeling the spray of hot water stream down her neck and shoulders and letting the warmth soak through her entire body.

She closed her eyes, letting the water massage her scalp, and felt the tension in her muscles begin to ease. The warmth seeped deep into her bones, and she felt her breath slow, her mind quiet. It was as if the world outside had melted away, leaving only the gentle rhythm of the water and the peacefulness of the surroundings. As she stood there, she felt a sense of connection to the natural world, a sense of belonging to something greater than herself. The water continued to flow, a constant reminder of the beauty and wonder of the world around her."

As she sat down, she heard a faint rustling sound coming from the other side of the room, followed by the soft thud of footsteps. ""Hello?"" she called out, her voice barely above a whisper. The footsteps stopped, and an unsettling silence fell over the room. Eden's heart began to beat faster as she wondered who or what could be lurking in the darkness."

I’m absolutely knackered!”","you're going to be sick, you should probably go below deck,"" her brother said, eyeing her",27,"you're going to be sick, you should probably go below deck,"" her brother said, eyeing her pale face with concern.

But today, she was feeling a little off, and the smell of the saltwater and the sound of the gulls crying overhead weren't quite enough to lift her spirits. She took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of unease that had been growing inside her all morning. ""I'm fine, Max,"" she said, trying to sound convincing. ""Just a little... seasick, that's all."" Max raised an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced, but he didn't push the issue. Instead, he turned his attention back to the sails, adjusting them to catch the wind. Eden watched him, feeling a pang of gratitude towards her brother. He was always looking out for her, even when she didn't want him to."
"Rufus opened a nearby cupboard and gestured to the neat stacks of pouches inside. “Voilà! My stash of airline pajamas.

"“WOO HOO! THIS IS FUCKING AMAZING!” Freddy shouted, his arms outstretched as he ran along the black-sand beach joyously like a little kid.

""Hey, let's have a bonfire tonight! We can roast marshmallows and tell ghost stories!"" The others eagerly agreed, and soon they were all busy gathering firewood and building a fire pit. As the sun began to set, they sat around the roaring fire, feeling grateful for this little slice of paradise they had stumbled upon."
