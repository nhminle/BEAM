The more I delved into the world of publishing, the more I realized that the industry was changing at a rapid pace, and I wasn't sure if my father's old-fashioned approach would be enough to keep him afloat. I tried to bring up the topic with him, to suggest that we adapt to the times, but he just waved me off, insisting that his way was the only way. I worried that his stubbornness would be his downfall, but at the same time, I couldn't deny the fact that his books continued to captivate readers, even if the way they consumed them was changing. The e-book revolution was in full swing, and I knew we needed to get on board, but my father was resistant to the idea, insisting that real books were the only way to go. I knew I had to find a way to convince him, but I wasn't sure where to start."

"“Butch and I were kids going to a one-room schoolhouse before the Second World War. We grew up in a no-stoplight dirt-road town fixing cars, patching them up, playing sports and then coaching them. As men we took part in town politics and maintained the town dump—very similar jobs, now that I think about it. We hunted, we fished, we put out grassfires in the summer and plowed the town roads in the winter. Knocked over a right smart of mailboxes doing it, too. I knew","him when no one knew his name—or mine—outside of a twenty-mile radius. I should have come to see him these last years, but I was busy with my own affairs. I thought to myself, there’s time. We always think that, I guess. Then time runs out. Butch was a fine artist, but he was also a good man. I think that’s more important. Maybe some here don’t and that’s all right, that’s all right. Thing is, I always had his back and he always had mine.”","Butch like the back of my hand, and I knew his family, the Watsons, just as well. They were good people, salt of the earth, and they always had a kind word and a warm smile for everyone in town.

As we grew older, Butch and I began to take on more responsibilities in the town, helping out with the local volunteer fire department and participating in town hall meetings. We were young, but we were determined to make a difference, and we had each other's backs every step of the way. Those were good times, simple times, and I look back on them with a sense of nostalgia and gratitude. Little did we know, however, that our lives were about to take a dramatic turn, one that would test our friendship and our resolve in ways we never could have imagined."
“Has to be a reason?” Pop asked when I finished reading him Ms. Crawford’s letter. “Is that what she’s suggesting? I guess,she never heard about the twin brothers who won large sums of money in their respective state lotteries on the same day.”,"that's what I'm trying to figure out,"" I said, studying the letter again, searching for any hidden meaning or clue that might",44,"that's what I'm trying to figure out,"" I said, studying the letter again, searching for any hidden meaning or clue that might have escaped me the first time around. Pop leaned back in his chair, his eyes narrowing as he steepled his fingers together, a thoughtful expression on his face. ""You think there's more to this than just some rich lady's guilt trip?"" he asked, his voice low and measured. I hesitated, unsure of how to respond, but before I could say anything, Pop continued, ""I've lived in this town a long time, kiddo. I've seen a lot of things, heard a lot of stories. And I gotta say, there's something about this that don't sit right with me."""
“Just that I can understand this woman’s interest in exploring the fact of you and Dave both coming from Nowheresville and blossoming,in the middle of your lives.” I raised my hands beside my head as if framing a headline. “Could it be… fate?”,"into two of the most influential people in the city, despite the humble beginnings that neither of you likes to",44,"into two of the most influential people in the city, despite the humble beginnings that neither of you likes to talk about. It's a fascinating narrative, one that could be spun into a compelling story of overcoming adversity and achieving greatness through sheer force of will. I can see why she'd be drawn to it, and I have to admit that I'm a little curious myself. What was it about Nowheresville that fostered such ambition in you both? Was there something in the water, or was it simply a case of two talented individuals rising above their circumstances?"
"So that was what I did, although something about the way Pop looked just then stuck with me. It was the look of a man who could say quite","a lot on the subject of how he and his friend Butch had achieved fame and fortune… but who chose not to. Who chose, in fact, to keep it close.","seriously that he had never been happier in his life, and still manage to convey the opposite impression.

I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it was as if he was trying to convince himself more than anyone else. I pushed the thought aside and focused on the task at hand, but the image of Pop's face lingered in my mind, a subtle unease that I couldn't shake off. As I went about my day, I found myself glancing back at him, searching for some sign of what was really going on beneath the surface. But Pop just kept on smiling, his eyes crinkling at the corners, and his voice booming out across the room as he regaled the others with stories of his adventures. It was only later, when we were alone, that I saw a flicker of something else in his eyes, a hint of sadness and longing that made me realize just how much he was hiding."
"“They used to pal around together back in grade school,” Alden told her. “Just a couple of boys who liked to fish or go hunting with their daddies.

It wasn't until they went off to different colleges that they started to drift apart, but they would always make it a point to meet up during summer breaks and reminisce about old times. Despite their different career paths and life choices, their friendship had endured, a testament to the strong foundation they had built during their childhood years."
"I read a review of Pop’s first book, The Lightning Storm, and the reviewer said this: “Not much happens in the","first hundred or so pages of Mr. Carmody’s suspenseful yarn, but the reader is drawn on anyway, because there are violins.”","book, but what does is told in a way that makes you feel like you're experiencing it for the first time, and that's a rare gift.”",42,"book, but what does is told in a way that makes you feel like you're experiencing it for the first time, and that's a rare gift.” I was intrigued, and I bought the book. I read it in one sitting, and I was hooked. I went on to read everything Pop wrote, and I was never disappointed. His writing was like a warm breeze on a summer day, soothing and comforting, yet with a depth and complexity that made you want to linger over every sentence. I felt like I'd found a kindred spirit, someone who saw the world in the same way I did, and that feeling has stayed with me to this day."
"I knew a lot of this. I learned more from Ruth Crawford herself at the Korner Koffee Kup, across the street from the Gateway Motel and just about a block down from the post office. That’s where Pop got his mail,","and there was usually a pretty damn good budget of it. I always stopped at the Koffee Kup after grabbing the post.

I would sit at the counter, sipping on a milkshake or a cup of coffee, and listen as Ruth regaled us with stories of the town's history and the people who lived there. She knew everyone's business, and she wasn't afraid to share it, but she did it in a way that was never mean-spirited or gossipy. She was a true original, and I loved spending time with her. As I sat there, listening to her talk, I felt like I was getting a glimpse into a world that was rapidly disappearing, a world of small towns and close-knit communities, where everyone knew each other's names and stories. It was a world that I was grateful to have experienced, if only for a little while."
"It was Ruth Crawford, looking slim and trim in white slacks, a pink shell top, and a matching mask—that was the second year","of Covid.

As I approached, Ruth turned and caught my eye, flashing a bright smile. ""Hey, kiddo,"" she said, and I felt a surge of affection for this woman who had been like a mother to me for so many years. We exchanged a brief hug, and I couldn't help but notice the way Ruth's eyes crinkled at the corners as she smiled. She looked happy, and that made me happy too. ""So, what brings you here today?"" she asked, and I launched into the story of my latest project, a documentary about the history of our town. Ruth listened intently, asking thoughtful questions and making supportive noises as I spoke. When I finished, she nodded thoughtfully and said, ""I think I can help you with that."" And with that, she led me on a wild goose chase through the town's archives, uncovering hidden gems and surprising stories that I never could have found on my own."
"“Not bad. As you must know, since you’re staying right across the street.","The muffins are better. But still no interview.

"“I swear. I found out that Dave won the annual town fair pie-eating contest from 1960 to 1966, when he retired from competition.

I also discovered that Dave's pie-eating skills were not limited to the fair, as he was known to have eaten an entire apple pie by himself at the local diner in under 10 minutes. The diner's owner, a gruff but lovable man named Gus, would often challenge Dave to pie-eating contests, and their rivalry became the stuff of local legend. As I dug deeper, I found that Dave's love of pie was not just a quirk, but a family tradition that went back generations. His great-grandmother, a French immigrant, had been a renowned pastry chef in her native country, and had brought her famous pie recipes with her to America. It seemed that Dave's pie-eating abilities were not just a product of his own gluttony, but a testament to his family's rich culinary heritage."
"“I learned that when Dave went west, he packed everything he felt he needed into the saddlebags of his Harley-Davidson motorcycle and just took off.",Your father and mother sold everything else he owned at a yard sale and sent him the money.

He met people along the way, some friendly and some not, but all of them left an impression on him. He saw the beauty of the Grand Canyon, the majesty of the Rocky Mountains, and the tranquility of the Pacific coast. And as he rode, he began to realize that the journey, not the destination, was the true purpose of his trip. He learned to appreciate the little things, like a warm meal at a roadside diner, a cold drink on a hot day, and the sound of the engine purring beneath him. And when he finally returned home, he was a different person, with a newfound appreciation for life and a sense of wonder that he had never known before."

I don't remember the details of the conversation after that, but I do recall feeling like my world had been turned upside down, and that nothing would ever be the same again. The rest of that day is a blur, but I do remember the long bus ride home, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios, and the feeling of uncertainty that hung over me like a dark cloud. When I finally arrived home, I was greeted by my mom's tear-stained face, and the somber expression of our family friends, who had gathered at our house to offer support. It was then that I learned the full extent of my dad's injuries, and the long and difficult road to recovery that lay ahead of him. That phone call, and the events that followed, would change me in ways that I could never have imagined, and would shape the person I am today."
“Yes. No. I don’t know.

But still, she seemed drawn to it, like a moth to a flame. I'd catch glimpses of her standing in front of the old Victorian, her eyes fixed on the boarded-up windows and the overgrown garden. It was as if she was trying to will the house back to life, or perhaps uncover some secret that only she knew. I often wondered what it was about the house that held such fascination for her, but I never mustered the courage to ask. Maybe it was the rumors that circulated around town, whispers of a family tragedy that had left an indelible mark on the property. Whatever the reason, Ruth's fixation on the house only seemed to grow stronger with time, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease whenever I saw her lingering around its crumbling facade."
"Two days after our off-the-record talk in the Koffee Kup, she came slow-rolling down Benson Street, and instead of driving past, she pulled over and stopped right next to the little signs on either side of the gate.

After a minute or so, she opened the door and got out, stretching her long, lean body like a cat waking up from a nap. She was wearing a pair of tight-fitting jeans and a sleeveless white blouse that showed off her tan. She walked up to the gate, her high heels clicking on the pavement, and looked at me with a curious expression. ""Hey, neighbor,"" she said, her voice husky and confident. ""Mind if I come in?"""

I found myself drawn to her stillness, a sense of calm that seemed to emanate from her very presence. As I stood there, a sense of curiosity got the better of me, and I walked towards her, my footsteps quiet on the gravel path. ""What brings you here?"" I asked, my voice low, not wanting to startle her. Ruth turned, a hint of a smile playing on her lips, and our eyes met in a moment of mutual understanding."
"“Hunting in the 30-Mile,” he said promptly. “We went the second week of November from the time we were teenagers right up until Butch mounted his steel pony and set sail for the golden west.

Faint at first, but growing louder with each passing moment, the soft murmurs seem to be coming from all around him, the words indistinguishable but the malevolent intent clear. Danny's heart is racing now, his breath coming in short gasps as he tries to run, but his legs won't move. He's trapped, at the mercy of the dream, and he knows that he's not alone. Something is out there, watching him, waiting for him to make a wrong move. The whispering grows louder still, a cacophony of sound that's almost deafening, and Danny feels himself being pulled towards some unknown horror, unable to wake up, unable to escape."
He’s walking along the shoulder of a dirt road that’s been packed and oiled to keep the dust down. It’s night. A quarter moon has just risen. To Danny it looks like a sideways grin. Or a sneer. He passes a sign reading,"COUNTY ROAD F, only the O and the Y have been spraypainted over, and UCK has been crammed in to the right of the F, so the sign now reads CUNT ROAD FUCK. There are a couple of bullet holes for good measure.","Riverview Trailer Park - 1 Mile"" in faded letters, the words seeming to leap out at him like a whispered secret.

The trees lining the road cast long, ominous shadows on the ground, making it seem as though dark fingers are reaching out to snatch at his ankles. A faint hum of crickets and the occasional hoot of an owl are the only sounds breaking the stillness of the night air. Danny's footsteps echo through the silence, a steady beat that seems to match the pounding of his heart. He's been walking for what feels like hours, but the trailer park sign tells him he's almost there. Almost where, he's not quite sure, but he knows he's getting close. The trees seem to be closing in around him, casting deeper shadows that make it harder to see. Danny squints, his eyes straining to pierce the darkness. Suddenly, a faint light appears in the distance, a warm glow that seems to beckon him closer. He picks up his pace, his heart racing with anticipation. What will he find at Riverview Trailer Park? And why does he feel an inexplicable pull to this place?"
"There’s corn on both sides of the road, not as high as an elephant’s eye but maybe four feet, suggesting it’s early summer. County Road F runs dead straight up a mild rise (in Kansas most rises are mild). At the top is a black bulk of a building that fills Danny with unreasoning horror. Some","tin thing is going tinka-tinka-tinka. He wants to stop, wants nothing to do with that square black bulk, but his legs carry him on. There’s no stopping them. He’s not in control.

He can't quite put his finger on why this place unsettles him so, but he can't shake the feeling that something is off. As he gets closer, he notices that the building appears to be some sort of old, abandoned schoolhouse, its once-white paint chipped and faded to a dull gray. The words ""Riverview High"" are etched in crooked, rusty letters above the entrance, and the front door hangs crookedly on its hinges, as if it's been that way for years. Despite the initial sense of trepidation, Danny's curiosity gets the better of him, and he finds himself wondering what could have happened to this place, and why it's been left to decay in the middle of nowhere."

The once-vibrant colors of the building have faded to a dull sheen, and the entire structure seems to be slowly being reclaimed by nature. Danny's eyes wander to the old gas pumps, their hoses hanging limp and still, like skeletal fingers reaching out for something that's long gone. The air is heavy with the scent of decay and neglect, and Danny can't help but feel a pang of sadness as he takes in the scene before him. He remembers the countless times he'd stopped at this very station with his family on road trips, the sound of laughter and chatter filling the air as they refueled and grabbed a quick snack. Now, the only sound is the soft rustling of the wind through the weeds, a haunting reminder of times long past."

"He goes around the side, kicking a couple of empty motor oil cans (Havoline, the Texaco brand) out of his way. There’s a rusty metal trash barrel, overturned and spilling more cans and Coors bottles and whatever paper trash hasn’t blown away.","Behind the station there’s a mangy mongrel dog digging at the oil-stained earth.

It wrinkles back its snout and gives a growl that can mean only one thing: mine, mine.","He steps over the mess, his boots crunching on the gravel beneath, and makes his way to the back of the house.

He steps inside, his eyes adjusting to the dim light, and looks around at the cluttered, cramped space. There's a small kitchen table in the center of the room, covered in old newspapers and empty food containers, and a worn armchair in the corner, its upholstery torn and faded. He can see a doorway leading to a bedroom, the bed unmade and piled high with dirty laundry. The whole place looks like it's been abandoned for years, but he knows that's not the case. Someone's been living here, and recently. He can see the signs - a half-empty coffee cup on the counter, a pair of dirty socks on the floor. He takes a deep breath, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of what he's looking for. And then, he sees it - a small, leather-bound book lying open on the kitchen table, a piece of paper slipped between its pages."
"The dog lowers its haunches as if to spring, but Danny’s not afraid (not of the mutt, anyway).

Danny can see the hunger in its eyes, the desperation, and his heart goes out to the animal. He slowly backs away, the can still held out, and the dog follows him, its eyes fixed on the offering. As he reaches the truck, Danny carefully pours some of the leftover food from his lunch into the can, and the dog wolfs it down in seconds. For a moment, the two just regard each other, a silent understanding passing between them. Then, with a final sniff, the dog turns and trots away, disappearing into the desert scrub. Danny watches it go, feeling a pang of recognition. He knows what it's like to be a stray, to be alone and adrift in a harsh and unforgiving world. He gets into the truck and starts the engine, the memory of the dog's eyes lingering in his mind like a ghost."

A sense of nostalgia washes over him as he remembers the countless memories he's made within those walls. With a deep breath, he begins to walk towards the entrance, the heavy metal doors looming before him like a gateway to the past."

The memories come flooding back, and for a moment, he's transported to a simpler time. He continues to stare at the photo, taking in every detail, from the neatly manicured lawn to the old-fashioned payphone on the side of the building. As he does, he starts to notice something strange - a figure standing just out of frame, partially obscured by the edge of the building. He can't quite make out any defining features, but there's something about the way the person is standing that seems off.

He glanced down at the map spread out on the passenger seat beside him, trying to get his bearings, but the roads all seemed to blend together in a confusing tangle of lines and symbols.

The waitress, a friendly-looking woman with a thick accent, comes over to take his order, and he asks for a cup of coffee and a slice of pie.

The bed is unmade, the sheets tangled from a restless night's sleep, and the curtains are still open, letting in a sliver of sunlight that illuminates the dust motes dancing in the air. Jalbert's gaze drifts to the old photograph on his nightstand, the one of him and his sister, taken on a long-forgotten summer vacation. He smiles wistfully, feeling a pang of nostalgia wash over him. It's been a long time since he's thought about those carefree days, and he's not sure why they're on his mind now. Maybe it's the quiet of the morning, or maybe it's something more. Whatever the reason, Jalbert can't shake the feeling that today is going to be a day of reckoning, a day when the past and present collide in ways he can't yet imagine."

His sister, Rachel, had called him the night before, asking if she could drop off the dog on her way to work, and Lloyd had agreed, but now he was regretting it. He wasn't really a dog person, and the thought of taking care of Bingo for the day was overwhelming. He looked around the room, trying to think of what to do with the dog, but his mind was a blank. He spotted a leash on the coffee table and had an idea. ""Hey, Bingo,"" he said, trying to sound enthusiastic. ""Want to go for a walk?"" The dog yelped excitedly and jumped up, running to the door and waiting expectantly. Lloyd sighed and grabbed the leash, clipping it to the dog's collar.

I saw a young woman, frantic and scared, her hands shaking as she packed a small bag and grabbed a handful of clothes, including the shirts. I saw her rushing out of a house, looking over her shoulder as if she was being chased. And then, everything went black."
He chuckled. “Got that right. Just put the stroller back and close the door. Deceased lady’s,keys are at the substation. Andy Pelley will pick em up. You remember who I’m talking about?”,"family will be here soon to take care of everything. I'm just the estate agent, not a babysitter.”",33,"family will be here soon to take care of everything. I'm just the estate agent, not a babysitter.” He turned and walked away, leaving me standing there, feeling a bit bewildered and more than a little annoyed at the abrupt dismissal. I looked down at the stroller, then back at the house, wondering what had just happened. The door creaked in the gentle breeze, and I pushed it shut, feeling a sense of unease settle over me. As I turned to leave, I noticed a piece of paper on the ground, partially hidden by the stroller. I picked it up, smoothing out the wrinkles, and saw that it was a note, scribbled in hasty handwriting. ""Meet me at the old oak at midnight. Come alone."" A shiver ran down my spine as I wondered who had written it, and who they were meeting."
Pelley took no chances. He took a mask out of his voluminous shorts and put it on as soon as we were inside. I got him icewater and poured myself more coffee. I thought about donning my own mask,"and decided not to. I wanted him to see my whole face. We sat at the kitchen table. Each time he sipped his water he pulled the mask down, then returned it to its place. The mustache made it bulge.","but decided against it, feeling a bit silly for even considering it.

Pelley, however, seemed completely serious about the whole thing, his eyes gleaming with a mixture of excitement and trepidation behind the mask. I handed him the icewater and he took a long drink, his Adam's apple bobbing up and down as he swallowed. ""Thanks, man,"" he said, his voice muffled by the mask. ""I don't want to take any chances with this thing."" I nodded sympathetically, still feeling a bit skeptical about the whole situation. ""So, what's the plan?"" I asked, trying to sound casual despite the growing sense of unease in my stomach. Pelley hesitated, looking around the room as if he was worried about being overheard. ""I've been doing some research,"" he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. ""I think I know what's going on."" I raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite myself. ""What is it?"" I asked, leaning forward in my chair. Pelley took another drink of his icewater, his eyes darting back and forth between me and the door. ""I'll tell you,"" he said finally, ""but you have to promise not to freak out."" I nodded, feeling a sense of trepidation growing inside me. ""I promise,"" I said, trying to sound calm. Pelley took a deep breath, his chest rising and falling beneath his shirt. ""It's not just a virus,"" he said, his voice low and serious. ""It's something much worse than that."""
"“Crazy all over the world,” Pelley said. “Why would you come down here in","the summer, anyway? Most people don’t, unless they’ve got free coupons from Disney World.”","the middle of the night to a place like this, where the only thing crazier than the people",28,"the middle of the night to a place like this, where the only thing crazier than the people are the stories they tell about the people?” He shook his head, a mixture of amusement and curiosity etched on his face as he gazed out at the dimly lit, rundown buildings that seemed to lean in, as if sharing a secret."
Devereaux began to shiver all over like a man suffering a fit of ague. His legs jittered and scissored. His back arched. His midsection rose from the couch and thumped,"down and rose again. His feet tapdanced and he began to make a sound, mump-mump-mump, as if his lips were spitstuck and he was trying to get them open to articulate.","back down, as if he had been punched in the solar plexus.

His eyes rolled wildly, and his mouth opened in a soundless scream. The air around him seemed to vibrate with an otherworldly energy, as if the very fabric of reality was being warped and distorted by some unseen force. His body continued to convulse, his limbs flailing about like a puppet on a string, as he was wracked by a series of violent, uncontrollable spasms. The room around him grew darker, the shadows deepening and twisting into grotesque, living things that seemed to writhe and twist on the walls. And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, everything stopped. Devereaux's body went limp, his chest heaving with exertion, his eyes wide with a mixture of fear and confusion. The room was silent once more, the only sound the heavy, labored breathing of the man on the couch."
On Saturday night he sat on the deck overlooking the lake with a quart bottle of Old Tyme ginger ale. He woke up on Sunday morning with no decision,"made, but with no hangover—a plus, but not enough. When he got back to Boston that evening, Sally Ann would be waiting to find out what he had decided.","made, but with a sense of clarity that he hadn't felt in weeks.

The warm sunshine and the sound of birds chirping seemed to have washed away some of the anxiety that had been plaguing him. He stood up, stretched his arms, and took a deep breath of the crisp morning air. As he looked out at the calm lake, he felt a sense of peace settle over him. He thought about the events of the past few days, and the conversations he had with his friends and family. He thought about the pros and cons of each option, and the potential consequences of his decision. And then, as he stood there, he felt a sense of certainty that he hadn't felt in a long time. He knew what he had to do. With a newfound sense of purpose, he headed back to his cabin to start making plans."
