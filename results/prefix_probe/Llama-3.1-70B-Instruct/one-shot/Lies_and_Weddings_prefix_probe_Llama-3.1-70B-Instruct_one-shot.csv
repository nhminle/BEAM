"They approached the altar positioned at the edge of the cliff and gazed out at the dramatic view of the Kona coastline just as the sun was dipping into the ocean. Gopal Das (Brimmer and May/Groton/Williams/UC Berkeley/Four Winds Shaman School), a tall, lanky Caucasian",man in his midforties with shoulder-length strawberry-blond hair and a matching beard stretched out his densely freckled arms in a godlike manner. “Let us welcome this blessed sunset.

He was dressed in a flowing white robe, cinched at the waist with a leather belt, and a garland of flowers around his neck. The air was filled with the sweet scent of plumeria and the sound of the waves crashing against the rocks below. Gopal Das began to chant in a low, hypnotic voice, and the group fell silent, mesmerized by the ritual unfolding before them. As the sun dipped lower, the sky erupted into a kaleidoscope of colors, a breathtaking sunset that seemed to match the rhythm of Gopal Das's chanting. The group swayed gently, as if drawn into the vortex of the ceremony, their eyes fixed on the shaman as he invoked the ancient powers of the land. The energy was palpable, and it seemed as though the very fabric of reality was about to be transformed by the ritual. Suddenly, a gust of wind swept across the cliff, extinguishing the candles and sending the flowers scattering. The group gasped, and Gopal Das's eyes snapped open, his gaze piercing the darkness. ""The spirits are restless,"" he declared, his voice low and mysterious. ""We must proceed with caution."" And with that, the ceremony took a dramatic turn, plunging the participants into a world of mystery and wonder."
"Gopal Das tucked the tight white tee that showed off his sinewy pecs into his camo-green cargo shorts and said, “Close your eyes. Now breathe","in deeply…. Let your first chakra connect with the ground, rooting in the earth, connecting with Gaia, connecting with spirit. Now, what do you feel?”","deeply, and let the sounds of the forest wash over you.

Now, slowly open your eyes, and let's get moving. We've got a long trek ahead of us, and I want to reach the waterfall before sundown.” He slung his backpack over his shoulder, the straps creaking in protest, and set off down the winding trail, his eyes scanning the surroundings with a practiced air of caution. The trees seemed to close in around them, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor, and the air grew thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. Gopal Das pushed aside a curtain of tangled vines, revealing a narrow clearing, and gestured for his companion to follow him."

"*4 Though Arabella was raised speaking the Queen’s English in what was then the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong and spoke with the poshest of accents, whenever she came into contact with other Asians—particularly","family members and service people—her accent would take on the inflections and sentence structuring that were peculiar to upper-crust Hong Kongers.

It was as if the sounds and rhythms of her childhood had been lying dormant, waiting to be reawakened by the familiar tones and cadences of her heritage. This phenomenon was not unique to Arabella, of course; many people who had been raised in multicultural environments often reported similar experiences, where the language of their youth would resurface in the presence of others who shared their cultural background. But for Arabella, this linguistic duality was more than just a quirk of her upbringing – it was a tangible connection to the complex and often fraught history of her family, and the many secrets that lay hidden beneath the surface of their seemingly ordinary lives."
"“That’s because I’m the only one around here who eats carbs,” Eden said as she took","a bite of her chocolate croissant, still warm from the oven. “You really ought to try one.”","a big bite of her sandwich, the crunch of the crust and the softness of the bread a welcome",33,"a big bite of her sandwich, the crunch of the crust and the softness of the bread a welcome respite from the protein-heavy meals that had become the norm in their household, a fact that she often joked about with her health-conscious family members, who would raise an eyebrow at her love for all things doughy and sweet."

"“The older woman said, ‘Excuse me, do you speak English?’ I was used to this question, so I simply nodded. The younger woman said, ‘We see you here every day. You’re so good with the baby. She clearly adores you.’ ‘Thank you,’ I replied. And then","the older woman leaned over and whispered, ‘Whatever they’re paying you, we’ll double it.’ I was so confused, and then it hit me: These women think I’m the nanny!

"Arabella credits her own mother for her confidence to upend centuries of tradition. “My mother grew up in Shanghai, which was the Paris of the East, so for her, Asian Fusion wasn’t a fad, it was a way of life.” Arabella’s barrister father","hailed from one of Hong Kong’s most respected legal families. “People are constantly surprised to learn that I didn’t grow up in a rice paddy.

She went on to open her own restaurant, which quickly became a sensation in the culinary world, with food critics and customers alike praising her bold flavors and innovative techniques. Despite the demands of her newfound fame, Arabella remained committed to using her platform to promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange, hosting cooking classes and workshops that brought people together from all walks of life.

"The countess never imagined that her modern spin on Marco Polo would spawn her own design and hospitality empire, but after a famously finicky Qatari prince spent the weekend and was wowed by the countess’s hospitality, he commanded her to design a hotel in London “for people who can only bear to stay in palaces when they travel,” promising to book out","the entire place every year for the London Season.

"Eden awoke to the sound of unfamiliar chirps. The chorus of birds outside sounded more spirited than anything she’d heard before, and they had been at it all night. Having arrived very late the previous","evening to a house at the end of a pitch-black road, she had no inkling of what lay outside. She rose from the bed lazily, flung open the louvered plantation doors, and almost gasped in disbelief.","evening, Eden had barely managed to catch a few hours of sleep, and the cacophony outside her window was making it difficult for her to drift off again.

She groggily got out of bed and made her way to the window, pulling back the curtains to reveal a breathtaking sight. The sky was a brilliant shade of blue, with the sun slowly rising over the treetops, casting a warm glow over the landscape. The birds, she realized, were perched on the branches of a nearby tree, their tiny beaks opening and closing in unison as they sang their morning song. Eden felt a sense of wonder wash over her as she took in the beauty of her surroundings, and she couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation for the day ahead. She had been looking forward to this trip for weeks, and it seemed that it was already shaping up to be an unforgettable experience. With a newfound sense of energy, Eden quickly got dressed and made her way downstairs, eager to explore the unfamiliar surroundings and see what other wonders the day might hold."

“Why? Are you going to the Wolseley? Look how I’m dressed.” Rufus gestured to his tattered board shorts and bare feet as they cut through a wooded path that led from the beach to a road that to Eden seemed straight out of a dream. Tall coconut,"palms, fragrant hibiscus bushes, and mango trees lined the winding lane of relaxed old bungalows and wooden beach cottages next door to the occasional sprawling mansion. Rufus reached up into one of the low-hanging branches as they walked past and plucked two ripe mangoes. “For breakfast.” He grinned.","trees towered above them, their slender trunks swaying gently in the breeze as the warm sunlight filtering through the leaves created a dappled pattern on the ground.

""I'm not exactly dressed for the Wolseley, am I?"" Rufus asked, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiled, and Eden found herself smiling back, feeling a sense of ease with this stranger that she couldn't quite explain. As they emerged from the woods, the road stretched out before them, lined with quaint shops and cafes that seemed to belong to a bygone era. ""Where are we, exactly?"" Eden asked, her curiosity getting the better of her, and Rufus launched into a story about the history of the place, his words painting a vivid picture of a community that was both charming and eccentric."
"“Puako Beach Road is one of the only places left on the entire island that still has these original cottages from the sixties right on the beach,” Rufus","explained. “It’s a real neighborhood, as opposed to some poncy resort.

Rufus gestured outside. On one end of the back deck was an outdoor shower nestled between thick tropical bushes and a,wall of stacked volcanic rocks.

Arabella nodded. “She is one of the hottest emerging artists around. She already has important galleries in,"London, Paris, and LA, and everyone’s flipping her work, so she can satisfy all of Rufus’s artistic pretensions.”","Europe and the United States clamoring for her work, and her last show in New York was a huge success.

They went outside to the wooden deck and sat down on a pair of canvas butterfly chairs.

"“Mmm. Love it.” Eden smiled as she took a long, slow sip, closed her eyes, and eased into her chair.

Eden nodded, trying to brush off the feeling, but Olivia's expression told her that she wasn't convinced. ""Let's take a break,"" Olivia suggested, tucking her phone into her pocket. ""We can grab some ice cream and come back to this later."" Eden agreed, and they walked in silence to the ice cream parlor, the only sound being the crunch of gravel beneath their feet. As they waited in line, Eden couldn't help but wonder what was bothering her about the text. Was it the strange symbols that kept popping up, or the way the words seemed to shift and change as she read them? She pushed the thoughts aside, focusing on the sweet treat in front of her, but the feeling of unease lingered, refusing to be shaken."

"No sooner had Rufus said this than a now-familiar roar filled the air and Freddy’s fantastical boat pulled up to the dock. As everyone climbed on board, a pair of dark-tinted glass doors automatically opened, revealing a sleek, Zenlike interior cabin where Freddy (CEE/Crossroads/NYU/Pepperdine), dressed in a pale beige cashmere sweater over a white","linen shirt and pleated linen trousers, lounged like a pasha on plush white cashmere cushions.

The cabin itself was a marvel of minimalist design, with cream-colored leather banquettes and a gleaming chrome bar that seemed to stretch on forever. As they settled in, Freddy busied himself at the helm, his eyes fixed intently on some point beyond the horizon. The roar of the engines grew louder, and the boat began to move, gliding smoothly across the water as the city skyline receded into the distance. It was then that Rufus noticed a small, discreetly placed plaque on the wall, engraved with the words ""S.S. Indulgence"" in elegant, cursive script. He felt a shiver run down his spine as he turned to Freddy, who was watching him with an enigmatic grin. ""So, my friends,"" Freddy said, his voice low and conspiratorial, ""are you ready to indulge in the ultimate pleasure cruise?"" The others exchanged nervous glances, unsure of what lay ahead, but Rufus just smiled, feeling a thrill of anticipation as the boat picked up speed and the wind whipped through his hair."

"The dream was always the same. She was six, maybe seven years old. Her mother, dressed in a white Lacoste piqué polo and a flared tennis skirt, would come into the room and ask her, “I’m going to the supermarket.

As she grew older, the dream never changed, but Eden's feelings about it did. At first, it was just a sad reminder of her mother's absence, but as time passed, it became a bittersweet nostalgia, a reminder of the happy times they had shared before her mother's death. Eden would often find herself wondering what her life would be like if her mother were still alive, if they could still go on walks together and share laughter and secrets.

"Just as Eden was about to continue protesting, the sound of heraldic trumpets echoed through the great hall.

"“Ah, you’ve been here before, then,” the docent said, looking pleased that this lady knew about the remarkable feature of the Picture Room.

As they walked, the lady asked thoughtful questions, revealing a deep understanding of art and architecture, and the docent found herself drawn into a lively conversation about the history of the house and its former occupant.
