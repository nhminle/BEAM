"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking.

Graham, however, had been one of the lucky ones, and as he slowly regained his strength, he found himself struggling to adjust to the unfamiliar world around him. The towering skyscrapers and flying machines that filled the skies were a far cry from the sailing ships and horse-drawn carriages of his own era, and he often felt like a relic from another age, a stranger in a strange land. Despite the challenges, Graham was determined to make a new life for himself in this brave new world, and he threw himself into the task of learning about the customs and technologies of the twenty-first century. But as he delved deeper into this unfamiliar world, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched, that there were those who were waiting for him to slip up so they could pounce. And then, of course, there was the matter of the mysterious woman who seemed to be following him everywhere he went... "
"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into","his eighties. As it was, he was thirty-seven years old and had not experienced crinolines, A Tale of Two Cities, or the enfranchisement of the working classes.","the early twentieth century, and would have known the men who worked in the nearby factories and mills, their lives a constant struggle against the elements and",53,"the early twentieth century, and would have known the men who worked in the nearby factories and mills, their lives a constant struggle against the elements and the relentless pace of the machines. The house itself was small, with narrow windows and a slate roof, its facade a testament to the utilitarian values of the era in which it was built. Despite its modest appearance, however, the house had a certain solidity to it, a sense of permanence that was reassuring in a world that seemed increasingly ephemeral. It was a place where a family could put down roots, where children could grow and thrive, and where the rhythms of daily life could be lived out in quiet contentment. Or so it seemed, at least, to the casual observer."

The air outside was cool and fresh, a welcome respite from the stifling heat of the summer evening. Gore's eyes were fixed on some point outside, his gaze distant and preoccupied, as if lost in thought. The smoke from his cigarette curled lazily upwards, adding to the misty atmosphere of the room. The sound of dripping water echoed through the silence, a steady beat that seemed to match the rhythm of Gore's thoughts. He was a man deep in contemplation, his mind a million miles away from the mundane concerns of the present moment."
"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale. A vile smell was seeping up from the floor.","plumber, a gruff but lovable man named Joe, was already on his way to the house, having been summoned by Gore's",39,"plumber, a gruff but lovable man named Joe, was already on his way to the house, having been summoned by Gore's frantic call the night before. As the sun rose over the small town, casting a warm glow over the sleepy streets, the sound of dripping water echoed through the empty halls of the old mansion, a constant reminder of the chaos that was to come. Meanwhile, Gore paced back and forth in the kitchen, his mind racing with thoughts of the impending renovation and the endless list of tasks that lay ahead. Little did he know, this was only the beginning of a journey that would test his patience, his wallet, and his sanity."
"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer. I’m sure he knew plenty about ship’s rigging, but he’d probably never handled an instrument more technologically complex than a sextant. Men in their right minds are","not usually overcome with a mania for pulling the plumbing apart.

He was a man of tradition, of tried and tested methods, and the idea of relying on a machine to navigate the high seas would have been seen as a crutch, a weakness. And yet, as he stood on the quarterdeck, his eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of land, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being left behind, that the world was moving on without him. The chronometer, with its intricate mechanisms and precise timekeeping, represented a future that Gore was not sure he was ready for. He was a relic of a bygone era, a man out of time, and the chronometer was a constant reminder of that fact."
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people. Hunting was out of the question, and socializing was limited by order of the Ministry. By the end of the first week he was visibly going bonkers with no one but me to talk to.","reading the works of Shakespeare and the poetry of Robert Burns.

As",79,"reading the works of Shakespeare and the poetry of Robert Burns. He had a deep love for nature and the arts, and his passions were evident in the way he spoke about them with such fervor and enthusiasm. As I delved deeper into his life, I found that Gore's interests and hobbies were not just passing fancies, but rather an integral part of who he was as a person. His love for hunting, for instance, was not just about the thrill of the chase, but also about the camaraderie and sense of community that came with it. Similarly, his talent for sketching was not just a hobby, but a way for him to express his creativity and capture the beauty of the world around him. The more I learned about Gore, the more I realized that he was a true Renaissance man, with a wide range of interests and passions that made him a unique and fascinating individual."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea. He told me stories as if he were trying to catch himself in amber. Just like my mother, though I didn’t tell him that.","the peculiarities of the people and the landscape, and then returning to his ship to record his observations in a leather-bound journal.

This sense of detachment, of being an outsider looking in, was a defining characteristic of Gore's, and it served him well in his work as a writer and a politician. He was able to observe the world around him with a clarity and objectivity that allowed him to cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter. And yet, despite his somewhat antiquated demeanor, Gore was not averse to embracing the modern world. He was a voracious consumer of new ideas and technologies, and he saw the potential for progress and innovation that they offered. This tension between his old-fashioned sensibilities and his forward-thinking outlook made for a fascinating and sometimes contradictory personality, one that was full of surprises and unexpected insights."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake. Another person’s unguardedness in that moment can be very useful, interpersonally, as long as you don’t soften. There is language I could use about this if I were the melodramatic type: behind enemy lines, for example, or double agent. My sister might use these terms, or she might call me a fraud.","he inevitably would, given the way these things usually go—I worried that he would feel deceived, that our friendship would be forever altered by the revelation.

I had grown accustomed to the ease with which I could navigate our interactions, the way I could tailor my responses to fit the narrative he had constructed around me. The thought of shattering that illusion, of watching as his perception of me shifted and morphed into something new, was daunting. I wasn't sure I was prepared to handle the consequences, to deal with the potential fallout that would arise when the truth finally came to light. And so I kept my secret hidden, locked away behind a mask of carefully crafted expressions and strategically chosen words. But the weight of that secret was growing heavier by the day, and I knew that I couldn't keep it hidden forever."

"Gore considers the weight of the sack he’d carried, which had felt so meaningful. “Three partridges,”","he says, “and a boatswain gull too far off to hit. Nothing else. Not even tracks.”","he says, shaking his head, the memory of their soft, lifeless bodies still fresh in",32,"he says, shaking his head, the memory of their soft, lifeless bodies still fresh in his mind, a stark contrast to the vibrant, fluttering creatures they once were, their gentle coos and soft rustling of feathers now silenced, leaving only the weight of his actions and the haunting question of whether it was all worth it."

He pauses, his gaze never wavering, as he waits for her response, his pen poised over his notebook, ready to scribble down every detail."

The ice outside shifts—the Arctic stammering its jaws as a cat does when it sees a bird. The ship’s cat died in convulsions during,"their second winter. Gore had liked that cat.

Some say it's a sign of bad luck, while others claim to have seen the ghostly apparition of the cat prowling the ship's corridors at night. The tension is palpable, and it's clear that the crew is on the brink of panic, their nerves frayed by the relentless howling of the wind and the creaking of the ice that threatens to crush the ship at any moment."
"Once we arrived at the Ministry, an escort of subtly armed suits took Gore to meet the other expats. I was expecting he’d","go through a group therapy session, but Gore was in a sunny mood, so he must have been envisaging something closer to a salon.","be whisked away to some high-security debriefing room, but instead, he was led to a lavish conference room filled with an assortment",47,"be whisked away to some high-security debriefing room, but instead, he was led to a lavish conference room filled with an assortment of international diplomats and high-ranking officials, all of whom seemed to be eagerly awaiting his arrival. The atmosphere was tense, yet there was an undercurrent of excitement, as if the very fate of the world hung in the balance. I watched from a distance, trying to make sense of the scene unfolding before me, as Gore was greeted with a mixture of handshakes and nods, his presence seemingly a catalyst for a flurry of hushed conversations and furtive glances. It was clear that whatever had brought him here, it was big, and I couldn't help but wonder what secrets lay hidden beneath the surface of this carefully orchestrated gathering."

"“We can’t risk the temporal repercussions,” said Adela. “They are supposed to be dead. As long as they’re here, it’s functionally as if they are dead in","their own time.

The weight of their presence was palpable, and Adela knew that every passing moment increased the risk of unforeseen consequences. She turned to her team, her mind racing with the implications. “We need to act fast. Let’s get to work on finding a solution before we run out of time.”"

"We went for lunch at a small bistro near the Ministry. Gore came from an era of service à la française, private dining rooms and putting everything into jelly. When I began to","explain, in tones of motherly patience, how twenty-first-century restaurants operated, he said, “I’ve eaten kangaroo on the uninhabited shores of the Albert River.

The bistro, however, was a far cry from the opulent dining halls he was accustomed to, and I suspected the chef would be hard-pressed to create anything more elaborate. As we waited for our food to arrive, Gore regaled me with stories of state banquets and the intricacies of diplomatic protocol, his eyes twinkling with amusement at the memories. I listened intently, fascinated by the glimpse into a bygone era, and the unspoken nuances of a world where etiquette and politics were inextricably linked. Our food arrived, and Gore's expression turned skeptical as he surveyed the modest fare, but he said nothing, merely nodding graciously as I invited him to begin. The silence that followed was comfortable, punctuated only by the clinking of silverware on china, as we both became lost in our own thoughts, the soft hum of conversation from neighboring tables providing a soothing background melody."
"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to",take us to”—here he raised his eyebrows—“a public house. I am looking forward to seeing what visions of sin this era has concocted for the humble tavern.”,"be built in such a way that it would be safe for me to cross, and that he would make sure the villagers would not bother me again.

He spoke with such passion and conviction that I found myself getting caught up in his enthusiasm. Before I knew it, we had reached the edge of the village, and he was leading me to a small clearing surrounded by tall trees. In the center of the clearing stood an old, gnarled tree, its branches twisted and tangled in a way that seemed almost magical. He stopped in front of the tree and turned to me with a smile. ""This is where I want to build the bridge,"" he said, his eyes shining with excitement. ""What do you think?"""
"Back at the house I was still struggling to think of as “home,” Gore shyly asked me if I would also “come for a drink.” He had done well, at lunch, to hide his deep embarrassment over my payment",of the bill (with a Ministry expense card); he was adjusting with gold-star alacrity in recognizing that it wouldn’t be a reputation-detonating act for a respectable woman to be seen in a public house in the company of bachelors.,"of the bill, but I could sense it still, a lingering awkwardness that I hoped a drink might dispel.

Gore ordered a whiskey, and I followed suit, feeling a sense of relief as the amber liquid warmed my chest. We sat at the bar, side by side, and for a while, we just sipped our drinks in silence, the only sound the murmur of the TV in the corner and the occasional clink of glasses. It was a comfortable silence, the kind that comes from being with someone who doesn't feel the need to fill every moment with conversation. As we sat there, I couldn't help but think about how much I had misjudged Gore, how my initial impression of him as a stuffy, uptight Brit had given way to a more nuanced understanding of a complex and multifaceted person. And as the whiskey worked its magic, I found myself opening up to him in ways I never thought possible, sharing stories and laughter, and feeling a sense of connection that I hadn't felt in a long time."
"I coughed at my half-pint. Ralph, a snide and etiolated former field agent, was my",least favorite bridge.

I took a few deep breaths, feeling my airway slowly clear, and shot him a look. ""I'm fine, Ralph. Let's just get on with it.""

“No. Apparently it was very awkward when Ralph came in here for a lunchtime gallon of merlot and spotted him. He’s part of Defence’s tracking,team.

I found myself returning to it again and again, studying the crude lines and symbols as if they held some hidden significance. It wasn't until months later, when I stumbled upon an obscure reference to a similar device in an ancient text, that I began to suspect Graham's drawing was more than just a joke. The text described a device capable of manipulating light and shadow, bending the very fabric of reality to one's will. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized that Graham's doodle might be more than just a product of his imagination - it might be a blueprint for something real."
"By the start of that summer, Graham was practically a native of the era. He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle. Most mornings he rose—hours before me—and",went for a run. He would sometimes wake me up with a juicy smoker’s wheeze on his return to the house.

He'd sit at the table, sipping his coffee and reading the newspaper, a ritual he'd adopted from the locals. I'd often find him chatting with the neighbors, discussing everything from the latest baseball game to the best way to fix a leaky faucet. His transformation was nothing short of remarkable, and I couldn't help but feel a twinge of admiration for the way he'd so seamlessly integrated himself into this bygone era. As the days turned into weeks, I began to notice subtle changes in his demeanor, a quiet confidence that came from feeling like he truly belonged. And yet, despite his newfound comfort, I couldn't shake the feeling that he was hiding something from me, that there was more to his story than he was letting on."
"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past. I was prickly and defensive about","this; I could not look at why directly. I heard the way I spoke to him about it: adjustment, reasonable, citizen, responsibility, values. He blew a lot of pensive cigarette smoke at me.","the way he spoke about the modern world, as if his criticisms were a personal attack on me and the life I had built.

I knew it wasn't rational, but I couldn't help feeling that he was judging me, that he saw me as a traitor to the past, just as he felt like one himself. His words cut deep, and I often found myself wondering if I had made a mistake by bringing him here, if I had been foolish to think that he could ever truly adapt. But at the same time, I felt a deep connection to him, a sense of responsibility to help him navigate this strange new world. I wanted to prove to him that the twenty-first century wasn't all bad, that there was beauty and wonder here, too. I just didn't know where to start."
"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them. Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled","to focus on the tests—eyes moving rapidly. I once found him the sole occupant of the fifth-floor smoking area (a pigeon-shit-encrusted balcony), methodically shredding a filter of a finished cigarette.

The room was designed to be a blank slate, devoid of any stimuli that might influence the expats' reactions. The tests themselves were a series of scenarios, each one carefully crafted to elicit a specific emotional response. The expats were shown images, videos, and even virtual reality simulations, all designed to push them to their emotional limits. They were asked to respond to scenes of great beauty and great ugliness, to stories of joy and stories of tragedy. The researchers watched their every move, monitoring their heart rates, skin conductance, and brain activity. They were searching for something, but the expats weren't quite sure what. As the tests continued, the expats began to feel like lab rats, trapped in a never-ending cycle of emotional manipulation. They started to wonder if they would ever be able to escape the complex, or if they would be stuck there forever, subjected to the whims of Dr. Kim and her team. The tests were taking a toll on their mental health, and the expats were starting to turn on each other. Alliances were formed and broken, and the atmosphere in the complex grew increasingly tense. It was clear that something was going to have to give, but no one knew what that would be."
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too. Even Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had","fought in large-scale battles, were laid out by the ultramodern scope of the harm.

"Adela was always present at the honesty exams, often intervening in them.

"I went along to one of the earliest dinners, chicken bag slung over my shoulder. Bridges tended not to eat at the Ministry canteen with administrative staff and the operators on the Wellness team—the office-based employees—and the decorous hostility with which the paper pushers met me was adorable.

I took a deep breath, trying to blend in, and reached for the bread basket. The dinner was a weekly ritual, a chance for the Wellness team to bond and discuss their latest projects. I had been invited as an observer, to get a feel for the team's dynamics and see if I could pick up any useful information. As I listened to their conversation, I realized that they were discussing a new initiative to improve employee well-being, and I found myself becoming increasingly interested. The Wellness team was known for their innovative approaches, and I was curious to see how they would tackle this new challenge. As the dinner progressed, I began to feel more at ease, and even managed to contribute a few comments to the conversation. But despite the warm atmosphere, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was an outsider, a stranger in a strange land. And as I glanced around the table, I wondered how long it would take for me to truly belong."

He had a nagging feeling that something was off, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was. As he strolled through the garden, he noticed a small, almost imperceptible change in the atmosphere. It was as if the very air itself had shifted, ever so slightly, and he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. Graham's eyes scanned the surrounding area, but he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Shrugging it off as mere paranoia, he continued on his way, the parsley forgotten in his hand."

The only sound was the creaking of the old wooden floorboards as the house itself seemed to sigh and groan under the oppressive weight of the heat. I didn't know what day it was, or what time, or even what month. Time had lost all meaning in this sweltering purgatory. The only thing that mattered was the next drop of water, the next faint breeze that might stir the stagnant air. And so I lay there, suspended in a state of torpor, waiting for the heat to break, waiting for the world outside to return to some semblance of normalcy."
"Adela took bridge meetings in a soundproof room deep in the Ministry’s chest.

The air in the room was always heavy with anticipation, the silence before the storm of debate and negotiation that would soon erupt. And then, with a subtle shift in her posture, Adela would bring the meeting to order, her voice clear and authoritative as she set the agenda and guided us through the complex web of alliances and rivalries that shaped our world."
Adela was standing at the sink and anarchically disobeying the water ration by running her wrists under cold,"water.

"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it,","was a mystery. She didn’t enjoy the prestige, as the Secretary did, and she seemed bizarrely overworked for the proxy boss of a project in its pilot stage.","remained a mystery to everyone in the office, but one thing was certain - her presence was a constant reminder that our carefree days were behind us.

Despite her icy demeanor, however, there was something about Adela that commanded respect, a sense of authority that was hard to ignore. As she stood before us, her eyes scanning the room with a mixture of disdain and disappointment, we couldn't help but wonder what had driven her to become the person she was today. Was it a difficult past, a string of failed relationships, or simply a natural inclination towards bitterness? Whatever the reason, one thing was clear - Adela was a force to be reckoned with, and we would do well to remember it."
"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had","just discovered that a woman with whom he was spending a lot of time would never be interested in him.

In that moment, I knew I wanted to be the one to help him break free from his isolation, to be the safe haven where he could be himself without fear of judgment or rejection. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I looked away, trying to compose myself, but I could feel his eyes on me, sense the weight of his gaze like a gentle touch. I knew I had to be careful, that I was playing with fire, but I couldn't help the way I felt. I was drawn to him, to the mystery and the pain that surrounded him like an aura. And I knew that I would do whatever it took to help him heal, to bring him back to the world of the living."
"Graham blew smoke out through his nose reflectively. “I see,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s fair to call him ‘grim,’ though you wouldn’t be the","first to say it.

But, I have to admit, there's something about him that's always left me a bit... uneasy. Maybe it's the way he seems to be constantly observing, even when he's not actively working on a case. Or maybe it's the way he can be so... detached, even in the face of some pretty gruesome stuff. Whatever it is, it's definitely made for some interesting conversations around the office. Still, I think you'll find he's a valuable asset to your team, even if he doesn't always make it easy to get close to him."
"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders.

As I stood there, frozen with uncertainty, a faint breeze rustled the leaves of the nearby bushes, and I could have sworn I saw Graham's eyelids flicker, just for a moment, before he returned to his statue-like stillness.

I thought about all the late nights spent studying, the early morning coffee runs, and the endless cups of ramen noodles that had fueled my journey to this moment. It was surreal to think that it was all behind me now, and that a new chapter of my life was just beginning. As I finished my ice cream, I felt a sense of excitement and anticipation for what the future held, and I hopped back on my bike, champagne in hand, ready to celebrate this milestone with the people I loved."
"“Apparently I can pass as an eccentric. I suggested that somewhere like Scotland, Arthur and I might","simply pass as Englishmen.

I'm not sure if that's a compliment or not, but I'm willing to try anything at this point. We've been all over the world, Arthur and I, and I have to say, the idea of settling down in a small town in Scotland is starting to sound incredibly appealing. No more running, no more hiding, no more looking over our shoulders. Just a quiet life, with maybe a small cottage and a garden. It's a tantalizing prospect, and I can almost taste the freedom. Of course, there's still the matter of my...condition, but I'm hoping that in a place like Scotland, people will be more open-minded. Or at least, more willing to turn a blind eye. I've heard the Scots are a hardy bunch, not easily shocked or surprised. I'm counting on that."
"When I brought the glass up—stoppering the rest of the bottle for dinner—I could hear Graham singing “I love to steal awhile away,” occasionally muffled by his drags on a cigarette. Water plashed against the tub.","He dropped to humming and presumably soaping. I slid quietly to the floor and leaned my head against the wall. I wasn’t going to see a Ministry therapist. I knew I should, and I knew I wouldn’t.","The sound was soothing, and I felt my tense muscles begin to relax as I took a sip of the whiskey, the amber liquid warming my chest.

As I stood there, the water continued to lap against the sides of the tub, creating a sense of calm that seemed to seep into my very bones. The world outside receded, and for a moment, all that existed was the sound of Graham's voice, the whiskey, and the gentle lapping of the water."
"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century. On ships there were cooks and officers’ stewards; at home, on the few occasions he was at home, there were women. Nevertheless, he had taken to cooking in a way he had failed to take to","television or texting or the use of deodorants (“I bathe every day,” he’d said to me with hurt dignity). Tonight, he hummed with a busyness that hardly shielded nervousness. He burned the onions and automatically reached for his cigarettes.

And so, he continued to cook, experimenting with new ingredients and techniques, and finding comfort in the familiar rhythms of the kitchen."
Margaret was wearing high-waisted cerulean bell-bottoms and a white blouse clocked with lace.

His eyes sparkled with warmth as he moved through the crowded room, shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries with ease. Despite his outgoing nature, Arthur was also a deep thinker, often lost in thought as he pondered the mysteries of life and the human condition. This unique blend of traits made him a compelling and empathetic listener, and people were drawn to him like a magnet. As he navigated the sea of faces, Arthur felt a sense of belonging and connection that he rarely experienced in his quieter moments. It was as if the energy of the crowd had awakened a part of him that lay dormant, and he reveled in the sense of freedom and joy that came with it. And yet, beneath the surface of his effervescent personality, Arthur was also a complex and sensitive soul, with a rich inner life that few people ever got to see."

"Margaret, incidentally, listened to the men talk about their careers with a suffused urgency that only I noticed. In her own era, she’d slept in the room next to the one where she had been born.","She thought Scotland was far-flung and semi-barbaric. When we came round to talking about my time working as a translator in Cambodia, I felt her attention all over me.

I could sense her feeling like an outsider, a relic from a bygone era, as she struggled to reconcile her own experiences with the vastly different world that now surrounded her. The men, oblivious to her inner turmoil, continued to talk and laugh, their words hanging in the air like a challenge, a reminder that the past was just that – the past – and that the only way to move forward was to leave it behind. But for Margaret, the past was a tangible thing, a living, breathing entity that she couldn't shake, no matter how hard she tried."
"How the topic of weed came up I couldn’t remember—probably during one of the vigorous debates about what the twenty-first century had genuinely improved, which in",the opinion of the expats was a mixed bag. I was shortly handing my grinder and papers to Graham (who was far more adept at rolling).,"our circle of friends was a recurring theme.

He swore that a friend of a friend had tried it and was still talking about the experience weeks later. We all laughed and teased him about his gullibility, but a part of me was intrigued. I had always been cautious when it came to weed, having had a few bad experiences in college, but the idea of something that could produce such a profound effect was tantalizing. As the night wore on and the conversation turned to other topics, I found my mind wandering back to the idea of this mysterious strain and what it might be like to try it. Little did I know, the opportunity would present itself sooner rather than later."
"Meeting Margaret made me vivid and receptive. Sentences weighed more. I kept a half-conscious catalog of where the men were looking. I’ve seen people deal with this in different ways. By “this,” I mean power. I mean magnetism. I try to absorb it. Within twenty minutes Margaret","and I were planning a girls-take-Soho night out, which necessitated me explaining the history of Soho, the concept of clubbing, the genre of R & B, the club night R & She, and dancing.

She was a master of her own domain, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the way she seemed to own the room. As I stood there, trying to make sense of the whirlwind that was Margaret, I couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to possess that kind of power and magnetism. Would I be able to wield it with the same effortless ease, or would I crumble under the weight of it?

"“In this age, musicians are imprinted inside music boxes, and there is no need for the band to","keep time,” said Margaret. “You will instruct me in the polka, or I will step on your toes.”","be physically present to play their instruments, as the music boxes can produce the same melodies",36,"be physically present to play their instruments, as the music boxes can produce the same melodies with perfect precision and harmony, thus revolutionizing the way people experience live music performances, and raising questions about the role of musicians in this new era of technological advancements."

He spun me, and I was, with such satisfaction, spun.","a flower, my back arched and my arms extended, and for a moment,",24,"a flower, my back arched and my arms extended, and for a moment, I felt like I was floating on air, the music swirling around us like a whirlpool, drawing us deeper into its rhythm, our bodies moving in perfect harmony, as if we had been dancing together for years, not just minutes."
"As soon as she stepped in, I started making a tally of the evidence of unbeauty. There was a chair whose seat was filled with clothes too dirty for the wardrobe but too clean for the washing basket. My bedside table sprouted two water glasses and a mug. Dust crouched on the skirting boards and in the seams of","my chest of drawers. When a woman is as impossibly attractive as Margaret, the mediocrity shed by a woman like me bustles around her like a horde of pigeons. Or so I thought, at that time.

She wandered over to it, running her fingers over the spines of the books, sending tiny puffs of dust into the air. I watched, fascinated, as she pulled out a tattered copy of Wuthering Heights, blowing off the dust before opening it to a random page. As she began to read, her eyes scanning the lines with a look of rapt attention, the room seemed to fade into the background, and for a moment, all that existed was the two of us, suspended in a world of words."
Margaret appeared unaware of any of these concerns. She didn’t even glance at herself,in the mirror. She gave me an interested grin as I pulled out my lipsticks.,"in the mirror that hung on the wall, her attention solely focused on the task",29,"in the mirror that hung on the wall, her attention solely focused on the task at hand, which seemed to be organizing the scattered papers on her desk into neat piles, her slender fingers moving with a quiet efficiency that belied the turmoil brewing inside her."
"I’d stopped wearing it—I was, at the time, thinking of the way my face might be received by a Victorian who didn’t approve of cosmetics—but I demonstrated the coverage of my sole foundation. Margaret","was amazed by the smoothness of its application and the faithfulness of its shade. She drew an arrow with it on her cheek. On her fair skin, it looked like clay.

""This is incredible,"" she breathed. ""I've never seen anything like it."" I smiled, happy to share my discovery with her. We spent the next hour playing with makeup, experimenting with different looks and techniques. It was a fun and lighthearted way to spend the afternoon, and I was grateful to have someone to share it with. As we chatted and laughed, I realized that Margaret was more than just a coworker - she was becoming a friend. And as we left the office that day, I felt a sense of connection with her that I hadn't felt in a long time."
"The door grumbled shut and I fell back into a doze. Margaret was snoring lightly, like a puppy being squeezed. The door reopened, and I","surfaced to vague consciousness.

Margaret, oblivious to the sudden tension, continued to snore softly, her gentle hum a stark contrast to the sense of unease that had settled over me. The figure didn't move or speak, its presence seeming to fill the room with an unspoken threat. I tried to call out, but my voice caught in my throat as the figure slowly raised a hand, its finger extended towards me."
"All the expats had phones, paid for (and tapped) by the Ministry. Graham had switched his own phone on a total of three times in the seven","months he had been in the twenty-first century. I was therefore unsurprised when, about half an hour after their plane landed, I got a call from Arthur’s phone.","months he'd been in the country, and only then to call the Ministry's emergency number, which he'd been assured was secure.

The rest of the time, it had stayed in the false bottom of his suitcase, a precaution he'd learned from a fellow expat who'd had his phone confiscated at a checkpoint. Graham had heard rumors of a new, undetectable surveillance system the Ministry was using, and he wasn't about to take any chances. He'd seen what happened to those who got on the wrong side of the authorities – the whispered warnings, the midnight knocks on the door, the sudden, unexplained disappearances. No, Graham was determined to keep a low profile, to blend in with the locals and avoid drawing attention to himself. But as he walked through the crowded market, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched, that unblinking eyes were trained on him from the shadows. He quickened his pace, his heart pounding in his chest, and wondered if he'd ever be able to truly escape the Ministry's all-seeing gaze."
"Arthur was striding up the street, bent slightly against a wind which didn’t exist. He was wearing a tweed jacket and looked like a period piece,","but then again, so did Pimlico.

His hands were shoved deep into the pockets of his jacket, and his shoulders were hunched up, giving him a slightly defensive air, as if he were preparing to ward off some unseen blow. The sounds of the city - the hum of traffic, the chatter of pedestrians, the wail of sirens in the distance - all seemed to fade into the background as he walked, his entire being focused on whatever it was that drove him forward."
"It paid off in the early autumn.

But I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something unusual about him, something that didn't quite add up. As we ate, I caught him glancing at me several times, his eyes lingering on my face as if searching for something. I felt a shiver run down my spine, and I wondered what had brought him to our house, and what his true business was."
"Adela was of the “never been to the GP in my life because I’m not a pussy” school of care, and nothing changed. If the expats were","dangerously ill, they’d be removed to the wards and never mind the trigger; if they could get a grip and deal with it at home, they should.","going to get sick, they would get sick, and if they were going to get better, they would get better, regardless of what the doctor said or did.",54,"going to get sick, they would get sick, and if they were going to get better, they would get better, regardless of what the doctor said or did. She had a deep distrust of the medical profession, which she believed was only interested in making money off people's hypochondria. As a result, she had never taken her children to see a doctor, not even for routine check-ups, and she had always relied on her own instincts and home remedies to cure any ailments that came their way. Her approach to health was very much a reflection of her overall approach to life: tough, no-nonsense, and self-reliant. She had always prided herself on being a strong and capable person, someone who could handle anything that came her way, and she saw no reason to change that now. But despite her tough exterior, Adela couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that this time was different, and that maybe, just maybe, she needed to swallow her pride and seek out some professional help."
"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs.

It was hard to reconcile the idea of this reserved, almost ascetic man with the passionate, charismatic leader who could whip a crowd into a frenzy with a single speech. And yet, at the same time, it was precisely this enigmatic quality that made him so compelling. I found myself drawn to him, even as I struggled to understand him. As the days passed, our interactions became more strained, like we were both waiting for the other to make a move. I knew I had to tread carefully, but I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to Graham than met the eye. I decided to do some digging, to see if I could uncover any clues about his past that might explain his strange behavior. Little did I know, I was about to stumble into a whole lot more than I bargained for."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory. Every time I gave Graham a book, I was trying to shunt him along a story I’d been telling myself all my life.","something almost palpable in the air, a sense of possibility that seemed to emanate from her very pores.

But as I gazed deeper into her eyes, I saw a flicker of something else - a spark of curiosity, a glimmer of a personality that was already beginning to take shape, despite her attempts to appear nonchalant. It was as if she was a canvas, waiting for the brushstrokes of life to paint her true colors. I felt a pang of excitement at the prospect of watching her evolve, of seeing the person she would become. And yet, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was also a part of that evolution, that my own biases and preconceptions would inevitably leave their mark on her. The thought was both exhilarating and terrifying, like standing at the edge of a precipice, staring into the unknown."
Graham was adamant about not informing the Ministry about his illness. It was the closest I had,ever seen him to entreating. I thought about it a lot. I liked being entreated by him.,"ever come to seeing him so vulnerable, and it stirred up a mix of emotions within me -",34,"ever come to seeing him so vulnerable, and it stirred up a mix of emotions within me - concern for his well-being, but also a sense of responsibility to ensure his secret remained safe, even if it meant going against the rules that governed our line of work."
"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled. Then again, whose upper management am I not describing? Who trusts their workplace? Who thinks their job is on the side of right?

The way she would avoid eye contact, the way she would change the subject whenever I asked her a question. It was all so subtle, so clever. But I was blind to it, blinded by my own naivety and my desire to believe in the best in people. And now, as I sit here, I am left to wonder what other secrets she was keeping, what other lies she was telling. The more I think about it, the more I realize that I didn't know her at all. And that's the scariest part of all."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.","that I had managed to get myself into such a mess, and I had to admit that I was still trying to figure that",39,"that I had managed to get myself into such a mess, and I had to admit that I was still trying to figure that out myself.

I'd been warned about the dangers of meddling with forces beyond my control, but I'd never been one to listen to advice. And now, it seemed, I was paying the price. Graham's eyes narrowed as he listened to my explanation, his expression a mixture of concern and curiosity. ""You're telling me that you stumbled into this by accident?"" he asked, his voice laced with skepticism. I nodded, feeling a twinge of embarrassment. ""I know it sounds crazy, but it's the truth. I was just trying to help, and things got out of hand."" Graham sighed, rubbing his temples. ""Well, we'll have to figure out a way to get you out of this mess. But first, we need to get out of here. This place isn't safe."" He glanced around the room, his eyes scanning the shadows. ""We need to find a way to get back to the others, and fast."""
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.","his lips, and a look of deep contemplation on his face.

The room was filled with the savory aromas of roasting meat and steaming vegetables, and my stomach growled in anticipation of the meal to come. As I hung my coat on the hook by the door, Graham looked up and caught my eye, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. ""Hey, I'm making your favorite,"" he said, his voice low and smooth, and I felt a warmth spread through my chest at the thought of the effort he had put into cooking dinner for me. I walked over to the table and dropped into the chair across from him, feeling the softness of the cushion envelop me. ""Smells amazing,"" I said, and Graham nodded, taking a long drag on his cigarette before exhaling a stream of smoke into the air. We sat there in comfortable silence for a moment, the only sound the sizzle of the meat in the oven and the occasional clink of dishes from the kitchen. It was moments like these that I cherished, the quiet, everyday moments that made life feel rich and full. And then, without warning, Graham spoke up, his voice cutting through the peaceful atmosphere like a knife. ""I have some news,"" he said, his eyes locked on mine, and I felt a shiver run down my spine as I wondered what he was about to say."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors.

I was amazed at how seriously he took everything, even the way the flavors of my mother's cooking mingled together. He would ask me to describe the taste of a particular dish, and I would try to put into words the combination of sweet and spicy and sour that danced on my tongue. He would listen intently, his eyes narrowed in concentration, and then he would nod thoughtfully and make a note on his datapad. It was as if he was trying to understand not just the food, but the culture and the people behind it. I found it both fascinating and a little intimidating, this intensity of his, but at the same time, it made me feel seen and heard in a way that I never had before. As the days passed, I found myself looking forward to our meals together, not just for the food, but for the conversations that came with it. Graham's curiosity was infectious, and I found myself opening up to him in ways that I never thought possible."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization. I wanted him in a role that didn’t require him to be at sea for months, possibly years,","at a time. It was too soon, I told myself. Whatever Adela said, he wasn’t ready, he’d barely left London, let alone land. But I wanted him to stay for other reasons too. It was humiliating to know that about myself and to say nothing into his implacable placidity.","at a time, and I knew that the navy would never be able to offer him that kind of stability.

I had always envisioned us building a life together, one that was filled with routine and normalcy, not one that was dictated by the unpredictable tides of the ocean. I encouraged him to explore other options, to find a career that would allow him to use his skills in a more traditional setting. He was hesitant at first, but eventually, he began to see the sense in it. We spent countless hours scouring job listings, attending interviews, and networking with people in various industries. It wasn't easy, but slowly, he started to find his footing in the civilian world. He landed a job at a private security firm, one that utilized his military background and allowed him to work regular hours. I was relieved and proud of him for taking the leap. As he settled into his new role, I could see the tension in his body begin to ease, and a sense of purpose start to take hold. We were finally starting to build the life we had always talked about, one that was filled with promise and possibility."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.","The upbeat melody clashed with the tense atmosphere in the room, and Graham, realizing his mistake, hastily reached over to turn it off, but not before the song's catchy chorus had already begun",64,"The upbeat melody clashed with the tense atmosphere in the room, and Graham, realizing his mistake, hastily reached over to turn it off, but not before the song's catchy chorus had already begun to echo in everyone's minds, momentarily distracting them from the weight of their conversation. As the music faded away, an uncomfortable silence fell over the group, punctuated only by the sound of Graham's fingers fumbling to find the pause button. The sudden stillness seemed to amplify the sound of their own breathing, and for a moment, it felt like time itself was holding its breath, waiting to see what would happen next. The air was thick with anticipation, and it seemed as though the fate of their discussion hung precariously in the balance, as if the next word spoken would be the one to tip the scales irrevocably in one direction or the other."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes. One of his first searches was charmingly housewifely: “Most challenging recipes”; “How to make cheese soufflé”; “What is miso paste?”; “Where to buy miso paste”; “How long has Japan been open to Europe?” A day or so after I’d read this report, I received another that listed the following search terms:","and that his online activities would be the final nail in the coffin of our already strained relationship.

I envisioned the Ministry's stern-faced officials gathering around a conference table, their faces aglow with the soft light of computer screens as they pored over the evidence of Graham's depravity. I pictured the Minister herself, her voice dripping with disdain, as she read out the list of incriminating search terms, each one a testament to Graham's warped and twisted desires. And I knew, I just knew, that I would be the one to blame, the one who had enabled his descent into perversion by introducing him to the dark and wondrous world of the internet. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets Graham might be hiding, what other surprises lay in store for me as I delved deeper into the mysteries of his online activities. As I sat at my desk, staring blankly at the screen in front of me, I felt a sense of trepidation wash over me, a sense that I was standing at the edge of a precipice, staring into the abyss of Graham's twisted psyche. And I knew that I had to be careful, that I had to tread carefully, lest I fall prey to the same darkness that seemed to be consuming him. But despite my reservations, despite my fear, I couldn't help but feel a twisted sense of curiosity, a desire to know more, to uncover the secrets that Graham was so desperately trying to keep hidden. And so, with a sense of trepidation, I began to dig deeper, to follow the trail of digital breadcrumbs that Graham had left behind, and to uncover the truth about his online activities, no matter how disturbing it might be."
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing,","as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday. This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option. We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit. Still, we had not told them about the death camps.","but to me it just looked like a lot of people getting very wet and trying to protect their belongings from the rising water.

She was shouting instructions at a group of teenagers who were struggling to stack the sandbags into a wall. I watched as one of them lost his footing and tumbled into the water, his phone flying out of his pocket and disappearing beneath the surface. The group erupted into laughter, and for a moment, the chaos and destruction were forgotten. I waded through the water, my wellies making a squelching sound with each step, and made my way towards Mrs. Jenkins. She spotted me and waved, her face flushed with excitement. ""Isn't this just the most ridiculous thing?"" she shouted above the din. I smiled and nodded, feeling a sense of community wash over me. We were all in this together, after all. As I reached her side, I saw that she was standing next to a large, makeshift sign that read ""Sandbag Central"" in bold letters. I raised an eyebrow, and she grinned. ""I made it myself,"" she said proudly. ""I figured we needed a bit of morale-boosting."" I couldn't help but laugh at her ingenuity. Together, we worked on building the barricade, the rain pounding against us, but our spirits high. As the hours passed, the water continued to rise, but our little community was determined to hold its ground."

"Adela’s voice contracted on that last sentence. She wiped her gaze, concentrated in her one working eye, up and down my face, to see if I’d noticed, and continued, “Our first priority","is protecting the expats and the time-door.

Her voice was firm but gentle, and I could sense a deep concern beneath her professional demeanor. I took a deep breath, trying to gather my thoughts and piece together the fragments of my memory. As I began to speak, Adela's eyes locked onto mine, her gaze intense and focused, drinking in every word."

"My email made a chiding noise. Adela was the originator, and she’d put me in blind copy.",It was a short email. Adela had a real gift for cramming apoplexy into a couple of lines.,"Her message was brief, but the words danced on the screen with an air of accusation, making",35,"Her message was brief, but the words danced on the screen with an air of accusation, making me wonder what I had done to warrant such a stern tone from my usually affable colleague, and why she had chosen to exclude me from the main recipient list, as if my presence was an afterthought or a mere formality."

I decided to probe gently, trying not to startle him out of his reverie. ""Hey, is everything okay?"" I asked, keeping my voice low and even. Arthur's eyes flickered towards me, and for a moment, I thought I saw a flash of uncertainty there, but it was quickly replaced by his usual confident smile."
"Anne Spencer almost made it off those wards. After I read the email, an ancient and exuberant terror blazed through me. It was partly the terror that had grown in me alongside my very bones,","knowing as I did that I only existed because my mother had outrun almost; I don’t know at what point you stop feeling the need to run, generation by generation, when you’re born after that.","the one that had been nurtured by the countless nights I'd spent listening to my grandmother's tales of the old country, where the veil between the worlds was thin and the whispers of the dead",70,"the one that had been nurtured by the countless nights I'd spent listening to my grandmother's tales of the old country, where the veil between the worlds was thin and the whispers of the dead carried on the wind.

And now, as I sat staring blankly at the email on my screen, I felt it coursing through my veins like liquid fire. The words blurred together as I read them again and again, my mind struggling to comprehend the implications. Anne Spencer, the woman who had been a constant presence in my life, the one who had held my hand through the darkest of times, was gone. The thought was a cold, hard weight that settled in the pit of my stomach, refusing to budge. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of memories, each one a painful reminder of what I had lost. And yet, even as the grief threatened to consume me, I knew I had to keep moving forward. I had to find out what had happened to Anne, to uncover the truth behind her disappearance. The email had been cryptic, but it had been enough to set me on this path. I took a deep breath, steeling myself for what was to come, and began to make my way through the hospital's winding corridors, determined to uncover the secrets that lay hidden within its walls."

I slowly got up from my chair, trying not to make any sudden movements that might provoke whatever was happening, and edged towards the door. My heart was racing in my chest, pounding out a frantic rhythm that seemed to match the kicking thing inside me. I reached out a shaking hand to grasp the door handle, my mind racing with thoughts of escape and freedom, but as I turned it and pulled the door open, I was met with a sight that made my blood run cold."
