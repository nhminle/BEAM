I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that,"we were crashing at my house, and I felt it was my duty to be the one to take the blows.","he had been drinking too much and was getting a little too friendly with her, his arm slung",41,"he had been drinking too much and was getting a little too friendly with her, his arm slung casually over her shoulders as they laughed and joked together. I could tell Autumn was trying to brush it off, but I knew her well enough to see the faint flush rising to her cheeks, and I wasn't about to let things escalate any further. I subtly shifted my position, angling my body to create some distance between them, and Jack, oblivious to the tension, just grinned at me and clapped me on the back, nearly spilling his drink in the process. Autumn shot me a grateful glance, and I knew I'd made the right call."
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.","Autumn—started teasing me about how I didn't even flinch during the whole film. They said I must be a tough guy, and that nothing scares",49,"Autumn—started teasing me about how I didn't even flinch during the whole film. They said I must be a tough guy, and that nothing scares me. I just laughed it off, but the truth is, I was actually really scared. I just didn't want to show it in front of them. I mean, who wants to be known as the guy who screams like a girl in a horror movie? But the thing is, I've been having these really weird and vivid dreams ever since we saw that movie. I keep dreaming about the creepy old mansion and the ghostly figure that haunted it. I've even started to feel like I'm being watched when I'm alone at home. I know it's just my imagination, but it's really starting to freak me out. I'm beginning to think that maybe that movie was more than just a silly horror flick. Maybe it was something more sinister."
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.","My mind, however, is a different story altogether, as it begins to wander to all the possible",36,"My mind, however, is a different story altogether, as it begins to wander to all the possible reasons why Jack is here, and what this unexpected visit could mean for me, especially given our complicated history."
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,"to glance around nervously, as if he's worried someone might be listening in.

I follow his gaze, but the only people nearby are a group of hikers setting up their campsite a short distance away. ""I'm just trying to get some rest,"" I reply quietly, trying to reassure him. ""And as for her, I think she's still sleeping. Why, is something wrong?"" Jack's expression is tense, and I can tell he's not buying my casual tone. He takes a step closer, his voice barely above a whisper. ""You know exactly what I'm talking about. What's going on with you two? You've been acting strange all day."" I sigh, feeling a mix of frustration and guilt. I know Jack's just looking out for me, but I'm not sure I'm ready to have this conversation. Not yet, at least."
"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with","the word “type.” Autumn makes a noise in the tent, and we both hold our breaths and listen.","e words ""I'm sorry."" I'm not sure what he's apologizing for, but his tone suggests it's something",35,"the words ""I'm sorry."" I'm not sure what he's apologizing for, but his tone suggests it's something significant. He looks up at me, his eyes red-rimmed and bloodshot, and I can tell he's been crying. I feel a pang of guilt for not being more supportive, but I'm still trying to process everything that's happened. ""What's going on, Jack?"" I ask, trying to keep my voice gentle. He takes a deep breath and starts to explain, but I can tell it's going to be a long and difficult conversation."
"“Zoned out the way she does? You have been so, so…","Like last week!” Jack asks, “How could you have missed that game?”","preoccupied lately, I'm starting to get worried that something's going",23,"preoccupied lately, I'm starting to get worried that something's going on and you're not telling me, is everything okay?"

I open my mouth.","smile that always makes my heart skip a beat, I feel a rush of emotions",29,"smile that always makes my heart skip a beat, I feel a rush of emotions that I've been trying to suppress all evening, and before I know it, I'm leaning in to kiss him, the world around us melting away as our lips touch in a soft, gentle caress that sends shivers down my spine."
"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke. Surely the school administrators knew we had always been together, were meant to be together. Surely, if I looked around the cafeteria, she would be there?","together was a bigger adjustment than I had anticipated.

We had always been inseparable, and now it felt strange to navigate the cafeteria alone, searching for a friendly face among the sea of unfamiliar students. I spotted Jack sitting by himself at a table near the window, and my heart skipped a beat as our eyes met. He flashed me a warm smile, and I felt a sense of relief wash over me. I made my way over to him, my tray wobbling slightly as I tried to balance my food and my nerves. As I sat down, Jack asked me about my morning, and we quickly fell into an easy conversation. Before I knew it, the lunch bell rang, and we were both reluctant to part ways. We exchanged numbers, and Jack suggested we study together for our math test the following week. I agreed, feeling a spark of excitement at the prospect of spending more time with him. Little did I know, this chance encounter would be the start of a lifelong friendship."
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time. I didn’t sit down because I recognized Jack though; I simply sat at the first empty seat, defeated. But Jack remembered me. He asked me if I ever watched pro soccer. I said yeah, not really interested in conversation, not really listening, wondering what Autumn was doing.","free rein to do as we pleased.

Now, as we sat down together, I realized that his interest might have been more than just about the game. He smiled at me, and I felt a spark of curiosity ignite within me. ""Hey, you're pretty good out there,"" he said, nodding towards the field. I shrugged, feeling a bit self-conscious about my athletic abilities. ""Thanks, I guess."" Jack chuckled and leaned back in his chair, his eyes never leaving mine. ""I'm Jack, by the way."" I introduced myself, and we started talking about our shared class and the upcoming school year. As we chatted, I found myself feeling more and more at ease around him, and before I knew it, the table was no longer empty, and our conversation had attracted a small crowd of curious onlookers. Jack seemed to thrive on the attention, but I was happy to stay in the background, content to observe and listen. Despite our differences, I found myself drawn to his charismatic energy, and I couldn't help but wonder what other surprises the year might hold for us."
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.","Autumn smiled back, and Jack's eyes darted to me, then back to her, as if searching for some sort of explanation. I could almost see the gears turning in his head as he tried to reconcile the Autumn he had heard about with the person standing in front of him. Autumn,",92,"Autumn smiled back, and Jack's eyes darted to me, then back to her, as if searching for some sort of explanation. I could almost see the gears turning in his head as he tried to reconcile the Autumn he had heard about with the person standing in front of him. Autumn, however, seemed completely at ease, her smile unwavering as she walked towards us. ""Hey, Jack,"" she said, her voice husky and confident. Jack's eyes widened slightly as he took in the sound of her voice, and I could tell he was struggling to process the changes in her. I shot him a warning glance, trying to convey that he needed to be cool, but he just looked at me like I was crazy. Autumn, oblivious to the tension, plopped down beside me on the couch, her movements fluid and relaxed. ""So, Jack, what's new with you?"" she asked, her eyes sparkling with interest. Jack opened his mouth to respond, but all that came out was a strangled sound, like he was trying to clear his throat. I rolled my eyes good-naturedly and intervened, trying to steer the conversation towards safer topics. But as we chatted, I couldn't help sneaking glances at Jack, who was still looking at Autumn like she was some kind of alien. I knew it would take him a while to get used to the new Autumn, but I was determined to make sure he didn't make a total fool of himself in the process."
"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face. He didn’t believe that Autumn was—or ever had been—my friend. The daughter of my mom’s best friend, who was around a lot? Sure. But he thought I had deluded myself into believing this hot girl was my friend.","his face, a mixture of sadness and concern that made me feel like I was the one who needed to be pitied.

As I watched him walk up the path to his front door, I couldn't help but wonder what he was thinking. Was he feeling sorry for me because of my situation, or was it something more? I pushed the thoughts aside and focused on driving home, but the feeling lingered, leaving me with a sense of unease that I couldn't shake off. The rest of the drive was a blur, my mind preoccupied with the events of the night and the look on Jack's face. When I finally pulled into my driveway, I sat in the car for a moment, collecting my thoughts before getting out and heading inside. The house was quiet and dark, a stark contrast to the chaos that had unfolded just hours before. I locked the door behind me and made my way to my room, feeling a sense of relief wash over me as I collapsed onto my bed, exhausted. But as I lay there, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off, that the night's events were far from over."
"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.","and I adorned the walls, and the tables were filled with her favorite foods.

I even went so far as to redecorate the living room in her favorite colors, a warm and inviting palette of golden yellows and burnt oranges. Jack was perplexed by my sudden obsession, but he humored me, attending each gathering with a mixture of curiosity and concern. As the weeks went by, I could see the skepticism in his eyes begin to fade, replaced by a growing understanding of the deep connection I shared with Autumn. He started to notice the little things, the way the sunlight streaming through the windows highlighted the vibrant hues of the leaves, the way the air was filled with the sweet scent of ripe fruit. And though he never fully grasped the extent of my bond with Autumn, he came to appreciate the beauty and wonder that she brought into my life. As the seasons changed, and the last wisps of autumn's warmth dissipated, Jack turned to me one day and said, ""You know, I think I'm starting to get it. Autumn may be just a season to some, but to you, she's so much more."" I smiled, knowing that he had finally begun to understand the depth of my devotion, and that our friendship had grown stronger as a result."
"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still","friends. On the last day of school before winter break, Jack finally said something. I cannot remember what I had been telling him, only that it had been about Autumn.","friends, and that our friendship was not a relic of the past, but a living, breathing entity that continued to grow and evolve with each passing day. As I stood there,",59,"friends, and that our friendship was not a relic of the past, but a living, breathing entity that continued to grow and evolve with each passing day. As I stood there, trying to convince him of something that I wasn't even sure I believed myself, I couldn't help but feel a pang of uncertainty. Had Autumn and I truly remained friends, or had we simply been holding onto a memory, a nostalgic longing for a time when life was simpler? I thought back to all the times we had spent together, laughing and exploring, sharing our deepest secrets and fears. But I also thought about the distance that had grown between us, the silences that had become more frequent, the conversations that had become more strained. And I realized that, despite my best efforts, I couldn't shake the feeling that our friendship was, in fact, a relic of the past, a reminder of a time when we were younger, more carefree, and more innocent."
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah? Let’s take this outside,” and hurried me out.","to start yelling at me, but instead he just shook his head and whispered, ""Dude, I think I left my math homework on the kitchen",41,"to start yelling at me, but instead he just shook his head and whispered, ""Dude, I think I left my math homework on the kitchen table."" I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation, considering the big game was just hours away and Jack was freaking out about his homework. I patted him on the back and said, ""Don't worry, I'm sure your mom can bring it to you during lunch."" Jack nodded, still looking frazzled, and we both headed out to face our second-period class, trying to shake off the pre-game jitters that were starting to set in."
"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind","yourself, ‘Autumn is where she wants to be right now, and that’s okay. I’m still great, and I’ll be around if she needs me.’ Hmm?” She squeezed my foot again.","yourself of all the things that make you happy and special, and try not to let the negative comments bring you down.

It's also important to talk to someone you trust, like a parent or a teacher, about how you're feeling. They can offer you support and help you figure out ways to deal with the situation. And remember, it's okay to feel upset or sad sometimes, but don't let those feelings define you. You are so much more than this one experience, and you have a bright future ahead of you. Just take things one step at a time, focus on your strengths, and know that you're not alone. Lots of people care about you and want to help. Now, how about we make a plan for how you can talk to your parents about this, and we can also think of some ways you can respond if you see those kids again?"
"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly. I’d show Autumn that I wasn’t a loser without friends; Jack and I would make more friends somehow.,"was a great way to do that, and I had always loved playing it, but I had never been very good.

I started practicing every day, running and kicking and doing drills until I was exhausted. And slowly but surely, I began to see improvement. I was getting faster, stronger, and more agile. My kicks were becoming more accurate, and I was starting to feel like a real soccer player. I even started to enjoy the feeling of being part of a team, working together with my fellow players to achieve a common goal. It was a great feeling, and I was hooked."
"Jack and I had worried one of us might not make it on the junior varsity team. When the lists were posted,","I searched for my name on the JV list and was devastated to not see it. Still, I was happy for Jack.","we were both relieved to see our names side by side, a testament to the countless hours of sweat and",44,"we were both relieved to see our names side by side, a testament to the countless hours of sweat and hard work we had put in on the field.

We had done it – we had made the team, and nothing could ever take that away from us. The feeling was exhilarating, and we reveled in the knowledge that all our efforts had paid off. We were going to be part of something special, something that would stay with us for the rest of our lives. The junior varsity team was more than just a group of athletes – it was a brotherhood, a bond that would unite us in ways we were yet to discover."
"Jack told me later that my ability to brush off the snarky comment from that junior, my new teammate,",made me seem cool. There had been chuckles of appreciation according to him. I wasn’t sure about that though.,"was a defining moment for him, as it showed that I wasn't easily rattled and could maintain my composure under",38,"was a defining moment for him, as it showed that I wasn't easily rattled and could maintain my composure under pressure, a quality that would serve me well in the high-stakes world of professional sports, where mental toughness is just as important as physical prowess, and where a single misstep can be the difference between victory and defeat, and as I look back on that moment, I realize that it was a turning point in our relationship, as Jack began to see me in a different light, as a teammate who could not only hold my own but also provide a sense of calm and stability in the midst of chaos."
"The varsity soccer team practiced on the north field, near the student parking lots. The junior varsity team practiced on the south field, closer to the circular drive where parents dropped off and picked","up kids. Even though Jack and I were on different teams, our schedules were still the same, and my mom would drive us to and from practice every day for those last weeks of summer.","up and dropped off their children.

The varsity team, consisting of the school's most skilled players, was led by Coach Thompson, a no-nonsense veteran with a keen eye for strategy. In contrast, the junior varsity team was a mix of younger players and those still developing their skills, under the guidance of Coach Lee, who emphasized teamwork and sportsmanship. As the two teams practiced, the sound of shouting, laughter, and pounding footsteps filled the air, creating an energetic atmosphere that drew in curious onlookers from the surrounding campus. Meanwhile, the school's athletic director, Mrs. Johnson, watched from the sidelines, taking note of the teams' progress and making mental notes for the upcoming season. The smell of freshly cut grass and the warm sun on their skin invigorated the players, who were eager to showcase their skills in the first game of the season, just a week away."
"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me. I was excited to tell him that practice hadn’t been as hard as I thought.,"that I was going to walk home, which wasn't true, but I didn't want to be a burden.

I started the long walk home, my cleats making a rhythmic thud on the pavement. The sun was beginning to set, casting a golden glow over the deserted streets. I couldn't help but wonder if I had made a mistake by joining the team. Was I really cut out for this? The doubts crept in, but I pushed them aside, focusing on the sound of my footsteps and the cool breeze on my face. As I walked, I noticed the houses and buildings around me, the way the light danced through the windows, and the smell of freshly cut grass wafting from the lawns. It was a peaceful, calming atmosphere, and I felt my anxiety slowly start to dissipate. By the time I reached my front door, I had made a decision: I was going to give it my all, to prove to myself and everyone else that I belonged on that team."
"We all joined Jack on the low wall, waiting to get picked up. We didn’t talk that much, but the next day, as I trudged from the north field to","the south, I saw the girls by the gym door again.

We tried to stay out of sight, hoping to avoid the same fate. But it was hard to shake the feeling that we were all in grave danger. The atmosphere was tense and foreboding, and we knew that our lives would never be the same again."
"What if, this morning, she woke up in the tent before I thought? What if she woke up as I lifted my arm off her, then lay there wondering why I had been","touching her, why I was still lying close to her and not speaking?

I had to find her, to talk to her, to explain, but as I walked, the trees seemed to grow taller, the silence thicker, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was already too late."
"It strikes me how backward my plan sounds: give up a girl who adores me, who I love well enough, to be a disciple for a different girl who will","never fall for me.

I find myself wondering what she's like, what her smile looks like, what her laughter sounds like, and what it would be like to be near her. The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that I need to take a chance, no matter how ridiculous it may seem.

“I don’t like him.” I shrugged. “I told you before: Autumn’s an old friend from when we were kids. Sucks that she,"likes such a show-off.” I shrugged again.

My face must change because she smiles and clambers into my lap. We wrap our arms around each other and settle in.,"After a moment, she says, “You know, I never thought this would happen either.

I take a deep breath and prepare myself for your reaction, hoping that you'll say yes, but also preparing for the possibility that you might need some time to think about it."
"“Yeah,” I admit. Jack was protecting me, but there’s no way he believed that I was over Autumn. I’m wondering now though. “What would","you have done if he’d told you the truth, that I was”—I try to remember how Jack put it before—“bonkers in love with you?”","you have done to make him think that?” I ask, my voice barely above a whisper.

""You've been distant, distracted,"" he says finally. ""You've been pushing me away, and I thought maybe it was because you still had feelings for her."" I feel a pang of guilt, knowing that I have been distant, but it's not because of Autumn. It's because of the secrets I've been keeping, the lies I've been telling. But how can I explain that to Jack without revealing the truth?"
"“I think my mother has a special bottle of champagne hidden away for just this occasion,” I say. I’m only partially joking. Mom has labeled some of her alcohol, like","for when George W. Bush leaves office and stuff. One expensive one said, “Finny-Autumn Day or NYE 2010.” At the time, I was glad she’d made alternative plans for it.","the ""Emergency Merlot"" and the ""I'm-So-Sick-of-Your-Father's-Jokes Chardonnay.""

I'm pretty sure she's been saving the champagne for a milestone event, like my graduation or her 50th birthday. But I'm also pretty sure she's been known to break it out for more mundane occasions, like a particularly grueling Monday or a really good sale at the grocery store. I head to the kitchen to see if I can find it, and after a few minutes of digging through the pantry, I finally locate the bottle, tucked away behind a stack of old cookbooks. It's a fancy French label, with a picture of a castle on it and everything. I grab a couple of glasses and head back to the living room, where my mom is still beaming with pride. ""I think it's time we popped the cork,"" I say, trying to sound sophisticated. My mom nods enthusiastically, and I carefully remove the cork, trying not to spill a drop. We clink our glasses together and take a sip, savoring the bubbly, slightly sweet taste. It's definitely not the most expensive champagne in the world, but it's perfect for the occasion. We spend the rest of the evening sipping our champagne and reliving old memories, laughing and joking together like we used to when I was a kid. It's a night I'll always treasure, and I'm grateful to have such a wonderful mom to share it with."

I pull up beside her, rolling down the passenger window as she slows to a stop, a look of determination etched on her face. “Come on, Syl, don’t be stubborn,” I coax, trying to reason with her, but she just shakes her head, her ponytail bobbing behind her."
"“Lexy,” I say. It’s too fucking early for her to call.

I swipe to answer, trying to sound more awake than I feel. “What’s up, Lexy?” I say, attempting to hide the gruffness from my voice. There’s a pause on the other end of the line, and for a moment, I wonder if she’s hung up on me. But then I hear her take a deep breath before speaking in a hushed tone, “I need to talk to you about something. Can we meet up today?”"

My mom's hand finds mine, giving it a reassuring squeeze, but even that feels like a reminder that I'm not in control here. We're led to a small office, the walls lined with framed certificates and the air thick with the scent of fresh paper and stale coffee. A woman with a kind smile and a clipboard greets us, her eyes locking onto mine with a warmth that makes me feel like I'm the only person in the room. She introduces herself as Ms. Thompson, and I try to commit the name to memory, but it slips away like sand between my fingers. My dad clears his throat, breaking the spell, and we take our seats, the three of us arranged in a neat row like we're about to pose for a family portrait. Ms. Thompson begins to speak, her words a gentle stream that I struggle to follow, my mind wandering back to the life I left behind, the friends I'll never see again, the memories I'll never make.

John, meanwhile, is still deliberating, and I can tell he's going to be one of those people who asks a million questions about the food. I settle in, prepared to wait, and take a sip of my water, the lemon slice floating on the surface like a tiny, citrusy island."

“She was”—he takes another small sip from his glass and sets it back down on the tablecloth—“cold to him is I suppose the way to describe it. She went out of her way to word things so it was understood that she and Stella and I were the real,"family.

And I think it was hardest on Stella, to be honest. She was the one who had to navigate this delicate balance between her loyalty to her mother and her love for her brother. I remember one time in particular, we were all at dinner together and she made some comment about how her mother had always been her rock, her confidante, and her brother just sort of...snapped. It was a small thing, but it was like a crack in the facade, a glimpse of the anger and resentment that he must have been feeling all along. And after that, things were never quite the same again."

As we wait for our main courses to arrive, John and I make small talk, discussing everything from the weather to our jobs, but I can sense an undercurrent of tension beneath the surface. It's not until he leans in, his voice taking on a more serious tone, that I realize what's really on his mind. ""I've been thinking a lot about our conversation the other day,"" he says, his eyes locking onto mine with an intensity that makes me feel like he can see right through me. ""I think we need to talk about what's going on, and what we're going to do about it."" I feel a shiver run down my spine as I wonder what he's referring to, and what the consequences of this conversation might be."
