We're all here to make a name for ourselves, to prove that we're the best of the best, and the pressure is on from day one. As we take our seats in the sleek, modern conference room, I can feel the weight of expectation settling in around us. The CEO, a charismatic figure with a reputation for being ruthless in his pursuit of excellence, stands at the front of the room, surveying us with an intensity that makes my skin prickle. ""Welcome, everyone,"" he begins, his voice dripping with an air of superiority. ""I'm glad you're all here. But let me make one thing clear: not all of you will make it through this program. In fact, I'm willing to bet that at least half of you will be gone within the first six months."" He pauses, letting the words sink in, and I feel a shiver run down my spine. This is going to be a wild ride."
"The truth, though, is quite the opposite. I hated school at first sight—with the direct consequence that school hated the sullen, listless child that I was right back. In the first grade, I refused to learn how to write my name, even though Hannah is only three letters repeated twice. In junior high, I set a school record for the highest number of consecutive detention days—what happens when","you decide to take a stand and not do homework for any of your classes because they are too boring, too difficult, too useless, or all of the above.

But despite all the chaos I caused, I was also the kid who devoured books in a single sitting, who spent hours scribbling in my journal, and who dreamed of one day becoming a writer. It's a strange dichotomy, I know, but it's one that would shape me in ways I couldn't even begin to imagine. As I navigated the ups and downs of adolescence, I began to realize that my struggles in school weren't just about me being a ""bad kid"" – they were about a system that didn't know how to handle someone like me. I was a square peg in a round hole, and it would take me years to find my true place in the world. But even in the midst of all that turmoil, I knew that I had a voice, and I was determined to use it. Little did I know, that voice would one day become my salvation."
"“It’s like space is your whole personality,” the girl I casually hooked up with during most of my sophomore year of undergrad told me. It was after I explained that no, thank you, I wasn’t interested in going out for coffee to meet her friends because of a lecture on","Kalpana Chawla I was planning to attend. “Do you have any other interests?” she asked.

She raised an eyebrow, clearly not understanding why I would prioritize a lecture over socializing, and I couldn't blame her. To her, and to most people, the idea of dedicating an entire afternoon to listening to a professor drone on about the nuances of Deconstructivism was probably mind-numbing. But for me, it was the highlight of my week. I loved getting lost in the abstract concepts and theoretical frameworks that seemed to make sense of the chaotic world around me. As I watched her pack up her things and head out the door, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of guilt for not being more like her – carefree, spontaneous, and unapologetically social. But as I settled back into my routine, pouring over my notes and preparing for the lecture, I felt a sense of comfort and familiarity wash over me. This was my space, my happy place, and I was content to spend my time exploring the intricacies of postmodern thought, even if it meant sacrificing a social life. The girl's words lingered in my mind, though, and I couldn't shake the feeling that there was some truth to them – that my love of solitude and intellectual pursuits was, in fact, a fundamental aspect of my personality. And as I took my seat in the lecture hall, surrounded by fellow students who shared my passion for theory and critique, I felt a sense of belonging that I rarely experienced in more social settings. It was as if I had found my tribe, my people, and in that moment, I knew that I was exactly where I was meant to be."

However, its nuclear-powered cousin, Perseverance, launched in July 2020, has been exploring Jezero Crater since February 2021, and has already made several significant discoveries, including the detection of seasonal brine flows that could be indicative of past or present life on Mars. As we look to the future of Mars exploration, it is clear that the lessons learned from Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity will play a crucial role in the success of upcoming missions, including the European Space Agency's ExoMars rover and NASA's Mars Sample Return. These missions will not only continue to expand our knowledge of the Martian geology and potential biosignatures but also pave the way for future human exploration of the Red Planet. Furthermore, the development of new technologies, such as advanced life support systems and in-situ resource utilization, will be essential for sustaining human life on Mars for extended periods. As we continue to push the boundaries of space exploration, the legacy of Spirit and Opportunity will serve as a reminder of the challenges and triumphs that have brought us to where we are today, and the vast possibilities that lie ahead."

"“Yes. Of course it would have been convenient if you’d had those funds at your disposal, but I’ve already discussed it with two of","my colleagues who agree that your work is meritorious.

"“I’ll be there, out in the field with you, of course,” Dr. Merel says. I’m a little surprised. In the months we were in Norway, I saw him do very little sample","collecting and snow plodding. I’ve always thought of him as more of a coordinator. But if he offered, he must mean it, and . . . I smile. “Perfect, then.

But now, as he stands up and begins to gather his gear, I realize that he's serious about getting his hands dirty. I feel a surge of excitement at the prospect of working alongside him, and I quickly finish my own preparations so that we can head out together. As we make our way to the field, the sun beats down on us, and I can feel the dry earth crunching beneath my feet. Dr. Merel leads the way, his eyes scanning the ground with a practiced intensity, and I follow close behind, eager to see what the day will bring. The air is thick with the scent of blooming wildflowers, and I breathe deeply, feeling a sense of peace wash over me. It's moments like these that I'm reminded why I became a scientist in the first place – the thrill of discovery, the beauty of the natural world, and the chance to explore the unknown. As we reach the edge of the field, Dr. Merel stops and turns to me, a look of anticipation on his face. ""Alright,"" he says, ""let's get started."" And with that, we begin our search for the samples that will help us unlock the secrets of this mysterious place."
"The problems start when he looks up and notices me. He stops exactly two steps below, which should put him at a disadvantage but, depressingly, unfairly, tragically, doesn’t.

For a moment, we just stare at each other, the only sound the creaking of the stairs beneath our feet, and I wonder if he can see the turmoil brewing inside me. Then, his lips curve into a slow, enigmatic smile, and I feel my knees weaken, as if the ground beneath me has given way. He takes another step closer, his eyes never leaving mine, and I can feel the heat emanating from his body, a palpable force that seems to draw me in, inexorably, like a moth to a flame."

"I cling to him. He lets me sob for long moments we cannot afford, pressing me against him with no air between us, until I can feel his heartbeat through the thick layers","of our clothes.

The world around us fades away, and all that's left is the sound of his heartbeat, the feel of his arms wrapped tightly around me, and the tears that refuse to stop falling. I cling to him, to this moment, to the fragile sense of safety he provides, and let the storm rage on outside, knowing that as long as he's here, I can face whatever comes next."
"“Who is M— Oh. Yeah. For the most part. Mom isn’t very fond of the Floyd side of the family.

"“Oh.” I swallow. “Merel was supposed to come for backup. But he wasn’t feeling well. I offered to wait for him, but he said we’d be losing valuable days of data and that I should just go","alone, and I . . .” I squeeze my fingers around the material of Ian’s shirt. “I went.

I tried calling him a few times, but he didn't answer, and I figured he was just sleeping off whatever bug he had. But now, as I sit here in the darkness, I'm starting to feel a creeping sense of unease. What if something happened to him? What if he's not just sick, but in trouble? I try to shake off the thought, telling myself I'm just being paranoid, but it's hard to focus on the data when my mind keeps wandering back to Merel. I take a deep breath and try to refocus, but the silence around me seems to be growing thicker, more oppressive, and I can't shake the feeling that I'm not alone out here."
"He shrugs. “I figured you might want to talk through your near-death experience with someone, so",I decided to tell Mara what happened.

My mind keeps wandering back to the past, to the memories that I've been trying to suppress for so long. I can feel the weight of my regret bearing down on me, making it hard to breathe. I need to get out of here, clear my head, and try to gain some perspective."

Just as I'm about to apologize, Sadie finally speaks up, her voice laced with a mix of sadness and resignation."

The air was thick with tension, heavy with unspoken words and unresolved emotions, as the two of them stood there, locked in a silent standoff, each waiting for the other to make the next move."

"“Hannah.” He unbuckles his seat belt and angles himself toward me, so that I have no choice but to look him in the eyes. He looks earnest and nearly offended. “I have thought about what happened in my office every day for the past five years.

I sigh and shut the fridge door, feeling like a failure. ""You know what? Let's just order pizza,"" I say, already reaching for my phone. My roommate's face lights up, and I can tell she's trying not to laugh at my lack of culinary skills. ""Sounds good to me,"" she says, plopping down onto the couch. I dial the number of our favorite pizza place and begin to order, feeling a wave of relief wash over me. As I wait for our food to arrive, I start to tidy up the living room, trying to distract myself from the fact that I'm a 25-year-old woman who can't even boil water. My roommate catches my eye and raises an eyebrow, and I know she's thinking the same thing. I shrug, feeling a little defensive, and continue to pick up stray socks and dust bunnies. When the doorbell rings, I practically leap to answer it, eager to escape the awkwardness of the moment. I pay the delivery guy and take the steaming hot pizza from him, feeling a surge of gratitude for the convenience of modern technology. As we sit down to eat, my roommate turns to me and says, ""You know, maybe we should take a cooking class or something."" I look at her, horrified, and she bursts out laughing. ""Just kidding,"" she says, holding up her hands in mock defense. ""I wouldn't dare subject you to that kind of torture."" I playfully roll my eyes and take a bite of my pizza, savoring the gooey cheese and savory sauce. Maybe being a non-cook isn't so bad after all."

“Or maybe it’s the Vastitas Borealis.” He’s barely intelligible. Doing those little thrusts that are designed more to open me up than to,"fuck me properly, and yet we’re both this close to orgasm.
