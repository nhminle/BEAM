I mean, can't she just have one day without Mum calling her, freaking out about something? It's not like it's always something serious, either. Sometimes it's just, like, Mum's favourite coffee mug is missing or something, and she's convinced that someone's stolen it. I swear, it's exhausting just listening to her. And the worst part is, she always expects everyone to drop everything and help her deal with whatever crisis she's having. I'm surprised she hasn't called you yet, actually. You're usually her go-to person for this kind of thing."
RG: Why am I the last one to find out that Eden isn’t coming to Hawaii? I find it hard to believe,that you wouldn’t want her beside you on your special day. Shall I talk to Mum?

I was really looking forward to spending some quality time with her and catching up on old times. Now I'm left wondering what happened and why I was kept in the dark. Was it something I did, or was it just an oversight? I need to get to the bottom of this and find out what's going on. I'll have to give her a call and see if I can get some answers. This is really frustrating, especially since I was so excited about our plans. I hope everything is okay and that there's a reasonable explanation for all of this."
"They approached the altar positioned at the edge of the cliff and gazed out at the dramatic view of the Kona coastline just as the sun was dipping into the ocean.

The air was electric with anticipation as the other participants, a diverse group of seekers and spiritual enthusiasts, joined in, their voices rising and falling in a hypnotic cadence. As the last rays of the sun disappeared beneath the horizon, the ceremony reached its climax, and the group fell silent, bathed in the soft, golden light of the setting sun. The sound of the drums grew fainter, and an expectant hush fell over the gathering, as if the very universe was holding its breath in anticipation of what was to come. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows, a stately Hawaiian woman with a gentle smile and eyes that seemed to see right through to the soul. She raised her hands to the sky, and the group erupted into a joyful chant, their voices carrying out across the water as the stars began to twinkle in the night sky. The ceremony had begun, and nothing would ever be the same again."
"Gopal Das tucked the tight white tee that showed off his sinewy pecs into his camo-green cargo shorts and said, “Close your eyes. Now breathe","in deeply…. Let your first chakra connect with the ground, rooting in the earth, connecting with Gaia, connecting with spirit. Now, what do you feel?”","deeply.

As you inhale, envision fresh, calming energy entering your body, and as you exhale, imagine any stress or anxiety leaving your body. Now, slowly open your eyes, and let's get moving. We've got a long hike ahead of us, and I want to make sure we reach the waterfall before it gets too crowded."" Gopal Das smiled, his eyes sparkling with excitement, as he slung his backpack over his shoulder and began to lead the way through the dense forest. The sound of birds chirping and leaves rustling beneath their feet filled the air, and the scent of wildflowers wafted through the breeze, invigorating their senses. As they walked, the trees grew taller, and the path grew narrower, until they found themselves standing at the edge of a clearing, where the roar of the waterfall grew louder, and the spray created a misty veil that surrounded them like a mystical aura."

You're not exactly selling me on this whole volcano-exploring thing. I mean, I know it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience and all that, but honestly, I'd rather be back at the hotel sipping margaritas by the pool. At least there, the only thing erupting is the ice in my drink. Speaking of which, do you think we could head back now? I'm not exactly feeling the whole 'adventure' vibe anymore. My adrenaline rush has worn off, and I'm starting to feel a little... well, let's just say, crispy. Yeah, that's the word. Crispy. Like a marshmallow that's been left in the campfire for too long. Ugh, just the thought of it is making me shudder. Can we please, for the love of all things sane, get out of here before I spontaneously combust or something?"

A winding stone path, overgrown with wildflowers, led to the front door, which was adorned with a beautiful handmade wreath made of dried flowers and herbs. The overall effect was one of charming, old-world elegance, as if time had stood still in this little corner of the world."

It was as if her brain had been wired to respond in a specific way when faced with the familiar sounds and rhythms of her childhood. This phenomenon was not unique to Arabella, of course; many people who had grown up in multicultural environments experienced similar linguistic shifts. But for Arabella, the sensation was particularly pronounced, and she often found herself wondering about the deeper psychological and cultural implications of this phenomenon. Was it a desire to connect with her heritage, or simply a matter of habit? And what did it say about her sense of identity, that she could so seamlessly switch between two languages and two cultures? These were questions that Arabella had grappled with for years, and ones that she continued to explore as she navigated the complexities of her own multicultural identity."

Their mother, a staunch advocate for the low-carb lifestyle, had been drilling the importance of discipline into their heads for months now, and Asher had been a willing participant, but Eden had always been the rebel, refusing to give up her beloved pasta and pizza. As she chewed, she couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction, knowing that she was getting away with something, even if it was just a small act of defiance in an otherwise strict regime."
"Suddenly Arabella’s eyes lit up and she seemed to recover slightly. “Yes, she will be good","for OS, won’t she?

"“The older woman said, ‘Excuse me, do you speak English?’ I was used to this question, so I simply nodded. The younger woman said, ‘We see you here every day. You’re so good with the baby.

The two women nodded understandingly and we struck up a conversation. As we talked, I learned that they were tourists from a small town in the countryside, visiting the city for the first time. They were fascinated by the sights and sounds of the bustling metropolis, and I was happy to share some of my knowledge with them. We chatted for a while longer, and before parting ways, they thanked me again for my kindness and wished me a great day.

"Arabella credits her own mother for her confidence to upend centuries of tradition. “My mother grew up in Shanghai, which was the Paris of the East, so for her, Asian Fusion wasn’t a fad, it was a way of life.” Arabella’s barrister father","hailed from one of Hong Kong’s most respected legal families. “People are constantly surprised to learn that I didn’t grow up in a rice paddy.

"The countess never imagined that her modern spin on Marco Polo would spawn her own design and hospitality empire, but after a famously finicky Qatari prince spent the weekend and was wowed by the countess’s hospitality, he commanded her to design a hotel in London “for people who can only bear to stay in palaces when they travel,” promising to book out","the entire place every year for the London Season.

She spent months scouring the globe for the finest materials and artisans, from the intricate marble mosaics that adorned the lobby floor to the plush, hand-woven carpets that lined the opulent suites. As the hotel began to take shape, the countess's vision for a truly regal experience became clear: a place where guests could indulge in the finest luxuries, from personalized butler service to bespoke spa treatments, all within a setting that was at once elegant and intimate. And when the hotel finally opened its doors, the prince was indeed true to his word, booking out the entire property for a month and bringing with him a retinue of friends and family who were equally wowed by the countess's creation. Word of the hotel's splendor quickly spread, and soon it was the go-to destination for discerning travelers from around the world, all of whom were drawn to the countess's unique blend of style, sophistication, and warm, welcoming hospitality. As the hotel's reputation continued to grow, so too did the countess's design and hospitality empire, with new properties and projects springing up in some of the world's most desirable locations.

The bed, with its intricately carved wooden frame, looked like it had been plucked straight from a fairy tale. A soft breeze rustled the leaves of the plants on the windowsill, carrying the sweet scent of blooming flowers into the room. Eden's stomach growled, reminding her that she had skipped dinner the night before, and she threw off the covers, her feet dangling in the air as she searched for her slippers.

“Why? Are you going to the Wolseley? Look how I’m dressed.” Rufus gestured to his tattered board shorts and bare feet as they cut through a wooded path that led from the beach to a road that to Eden seemed straight out of a dream.

Rufus reached up into one of the low-hanging branches as they walked past and plucked two ripe mangoes. “For breakfast.” He grinned.","trees towered above them, their slender trunks swaying gently in the breeze as the warm sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the ground.

As they walked, the trees grew closer together, forming a canopy above them, and the sound of the waves grew fainter, replaced by the chirping of birds and the rustling of leaves. The road began to wind and twist, leading them deeper into the heart of the island. Eden felt a sense of adventure stirring within her, a sense of possibility that she hadn't felt in a long time. She glanced over at Rufus, who was still grumbling about his clothes, and smiled. She had a feeling that this day was going to be one to remember."

As she sat there, she felt grateful for this little slice of heaven, this quiet corner of the world where she could escape the chaos and just be.

As she took a deep breath, the doorbell rang, signaling the start of a night that would be filled with friends, food, and celebration."
"No you’re not, Eden thought to herself as she sipped on her coffee, taking in the sounds of the waves","pounding onto the lava rocks and the ecstatic screech of birds. “I’ve never heard birds quite like this before,” she said.","crashing against the shore.

Her mind began to wander back to the argument she had with her sister, Rachel, and the words they had left unspoken. Eden's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of seagulls crying overhead, and she watched as they soared effortlessly on the breeze, their snowy feathers glistening in the morning sun. She felt a pang of envy, wishing she could be as free as they were, unencumbered by the weight of her own worries. As she sat there, lost in thought, a gentle breeze rustled her hair, and she closed her eyes, letting the peacefulness of the moment wash over her."

""Hey, someone's got to be honest around here. Besides, it's not like she's going to wear it to a fashion show or anything."" The group chuckled, and the tension was momentarily broken.

""This is Ryker's suite,"" her companion replied, a low, smooth voice that sent a shiver down Eden's spine. ""He's a... business associate of my father's."" Eden's gaze narrowed, her mind racing with questions, but before she could ask any of them, a figure emerged from the crowd, his piercing blue eyes locking onto hers with an unnerving intensity. ""Ah, welcome, Eden,"" he said, his voice dripping with charm. ""I see you're getting acquainted with my humble abode."" Eden's instincts screamed at her to be wary, but her curiosity got the better of her, and she found herself smiling, playing along with the charade, even as she wondered what secrets lay hidden beneath the polished facade."
"Eden fetched the bulky garment bag and unzipped it, staring at its contents in confusion. There was a",shimmering ice-blue evening gown complemented by a turquoise faux-fur coat. “A fur coat?

She had no recollection of buying or even seeing the dress before, and yet, it seemed to be calling to her, drawing her in with an otherworldly allure. As she reached out a trembling hand to touch the soft fabric, a faint memory began to surface, like a whisper from a long-forgotten dream. It was a memory of a summer day, warm and sunny, with the sound of birds singing in the distance and the smell of freshly cut grass wafting through the air. In this memory, she was standing in a beautiful garden, surrounded by friends and family, and she was wearing this very dress, her heart full of joy and love. But as the memory began to take shape, it was quickly snatched away, leaving Eden feeling frustrated and disoriented. She looked around the room, hoping to find some clue as to what was happening, but there was nothing. The dress, however, remained, a constant reminder of the mystery that lay before her."

"“We’re so high up that you can see the curve of the horizon!” Eden exclaimed, glancing at her",father and noticing that he suddenly appeared a bit pale. “Dad!

The endless expanse of blue stretched out before them, meeting the sky at a subtle arc that seemed almost imperceptible. As they stood at the edge of the observation deck, the wind whipping their hair into a frenzy, Eden felt a thrill of excitement mixed with a touch of vertigo. She took a step back, her eyes fixed on the horizon, and felt a sense of awe wash over her. The world seemed so much bigger and more mysterious from up here, full of secrets waiting to be uncovered. She turned to her friend, a grin spreading across her face. ""Can you believe we're actually here?"" she asked, her voice barely audible over the wind. Her friend looked up, a smile mirroring Eden's, and nodded enthusiastically. ""It's incredible,"" she said, snapping a photo of the view. ""I've never seen anything like it."" Eden nodded in agreement, feeling grateful for the experience and the friend by her side to share it with."
"Just as Eden was about to continue protesting, the sound of heraldic trumpets echoed through the great hall.

The air was filled with the rustling of fine silks and the soft murmur of conversation as the guests made their way to their designated seats. At the far end of the hall, a raised dais stood, upon which sat the monarch, resplendent in their coronation finery. The monarch's eyes swept the room, their gaze lingering on Eden before moving on to the rest of the assembly. As the last of the guests took their seats, the trumpeters fell silent, and a hush fell over the hall. The monarch rose from their throne, and with a regal gesture, signaled the commencement of the proceedings. The room erupted into a flurry of activity as the ceremony began, with Eden's protest all but forgotten in the excitement of the moment. The monarch's voice boomed through the hall, echoing off the stone walls as they began to speak, their words dripping with gravitas and authority. Eden's eyes narrowed, their mind racing with the implications of what was unfolding before them. They knew that they had to act quickly, or risk being silenced forever."
"“Sure looks like it,” Eden said as one of the floppy-haired waiters skated up and placed a tall fluted glass filled with a frothy dark liquid","in front of her.

As the flavors danced on her tongue, she closed her eyes, letting out a contented sigh. The sounds of the café receded, and for a moment, she was transported to a different time and place, one where life was simpler and her biggest worry was what book to read next. But as she opened her eyes, the sounds came flooding back, and she was once again in the bustling café, surrounded by the hum of conversation and the clinking of cups. She glanced around, taking in the eclectic decor, the vintage posters on the walls, and the mismatched furniture, each piece more colorful and quirky than the last. It was a place that seemed to defy categorization, a place where artists and writers, musicians and dreamers, all came together to create something beautiful. And in that moment, Eden felt like she had finally found a place where she belonged."
"Rufus sighed. “A fairy tale? Everything about this is wrong. This ice palace was supposed to be half the size and built at the resort, not up here.

The ice walls towered above him, their facets glinting in the pale winter sun like a scattering of diamonds, and the sound of dripping water echoed through the cavernous space like a mournful sigh. Rufus's mind was racing with questions - who had authorized this massive undertaking, and why had he not been informed? He thought back to the meetings with the client, the endless discussions about budget and design, but there had been no mention of anything on this scale. A shiver ran down his spine as he realized that he was completely alone in the palace, the only sound the soft creaking of the ice and the distant rumble of the wind outside. He knew he had to get to the bottom of this, but as he turned to leave, he caught sight of something that made his heart skip a beat - a figure, tall and imposing, standing just beyond the edge of the light."

"Eden stood under the shower on Rufus’s back deck, feeling the spray of hot water stream down her neck and shoulders and letting the warmth soak through her entire body.

The sound of birds chirping and the distant rumble of a waterfall created a soothing melody that seemed to lull her into a state of tranquility. As she stood there, she felt a sense of peace settle over her, a sense of being exactly where she was meant to be. The water began to cool, and she reluctantly turned off the shower, feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. She wrapped herself in a towel and stepped out onto the deck, where Rufus was waiting with a warm smile and a steaming cup of coffee."

""The water's perfect today,"" she called out, her voice carrying on the wind, ""not too cold, not too warm. Just right."" And with that, she tossed the towel aside and dove off the side of the boat, her body slicing through the surface of the water with barely a ripple."

“The last thing we wanted was to be trapped in a pitch meeting with some,"tech desperado while we’re a thousand feet in the air,” Martha (Diocesan Girls’/Geelong Grammar/Griffith) chimed in.","high-powered executive who would try to mold our idea into something that would appeal to the masses, rather than staying",31,"high-powered executive who would try to mold our idea into something that would appeal to the masses, rather than staying true to our artistic vision. We had heard horror stories about the Hollywood machine and how it could chew up and spit out even the most talented and dedicated filmmakers. So, we decided to take a different approach, one that would allow us to maintain creative control and bring our unique perspective to the project. We began to explore alternative funding options, reaching out to independent investors and considering crowdfunding campaigns. It wasn't going to be easy, but we were determined to make our film on our own terms."

And don't even get me started on Emily, she's always finding excuses to 'accidentally' bump into you in the hallway. You're like a magnet, drawing everyone in with your charisma and charm. But Martha's obsession takes the cake – I've seen her collection of newspaper clippings and fan art, it's borderline creepy. I'm starting to think we should stage an intervention before things get out of hand."

His owner, Rachel, chuckled and handed him a dog treat instead, which he gobbled up with a grateful wag of his tail. As she stirred the fettucine, she couldn't help but think about how Putter had become an integral part of their little family, always lurking in the kitchen, hoping to score a snack or two. His antics often provided comic relief, and Rachel was grateful for the companionship, especially on days when her husband was away on business. Just then, the phone rang, shrill in the silence, and Rachel's heart skipped a beat as she wondered who it could be, hoping it was her husband calling to check in."

The truffle oil added a rich, earthy note that complemented the creamy Arborio rice perfectly. As he savored the dish, he felt a gentle tap on his shoulder. It was their host, a middle-aged man with a charming smile and an air of confidence that bordered on arrogance. ""Enjoying the risotto, I see,"" he said, his voice booming across the room. Putter nodded enthusiastically, still chewing, and the host continued, ""I'm glad you're appreciating the effort that went into preparing it. My chef is a genius, if I do say so myself."" Putter's wife raised an eyebrow, her expression skeptical, but Putter was too caught up in the culinary delight to notice. He took another bite, and the host excused himself, leaving the couple to their meal. As they ate, Putter's wife leaned in closer, her voice barely above a whisper. ""I don't know how much more of this I can take,"" she said, her eyes darting around the room. ""These people are all so...pretentious."" Putter looked up, finally noticing his wife's discomfort. ""What's wrong?"" he asked, his brow furrowed in concern. But before she could respond, the host stood up, a glass of wine in hand, and began to speak.
