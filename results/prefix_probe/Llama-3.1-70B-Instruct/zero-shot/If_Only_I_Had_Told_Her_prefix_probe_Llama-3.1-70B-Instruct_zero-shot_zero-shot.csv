I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that,"we were crashing at my house, and I felt it was my duty to be the one to take the blows.",41,"they were getting a bit too cozy, and I didn't want things to escalate into something that might make our group dynamic awkward. As we walked, I made small talk with Autumn, asking her about her favorite hiking spots and trying to steer the conversation towards more neutral topics. Jack seemed to take the hint and fell back a bit, chatting with Emily instead. I breathed a silent sigh of relief, hoping that I had averted a potentially uncomfortable situation. But as the night wore on, I couldn't shake the feeling that Jack's interest in Autumn was more than just friendly, and I wondered if I had just delayed the inevitable."
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.",49,"Autumn's boyfriend, Alex—started teasing her about being a scaredy-cat. They joked that she was so frightened by the movie that she would probably have nightmares for weeks. Autumn took their jokes in stride, but I could tell she was a bit annoyed. She's always been a bit of a movie buff, and she hates it when people make fun of her reactions to scary films. I tried to stay out of it, but it was hard not to laugh at their banter. As we walked home from the theater, the teasing continued, with Jack and Alex making spooky noises and jumping out at Autumn to try and scare her. She pretended to be annoyed, but I could see the hint of a smile on her face. It was clear that she was enjoying the attention, even if she didn't want to admit it. As we turned the corner onto our street, Autumn suddenly stopped and pointed to a flyer on the community board outside the local coffee shop. ""Hey, guys, look at this,"" she said, her voice filled with excitement. ""A haunted house is opening up on the outskirts of town, and it's supposed to be super scary."" Jack and Alex exchanged a skeptical look, but Autumn was undeterred. ""We have to go,"" she said, her eyes shining with enthusiasm. ""It'll be fun, I promise."" I raised an eyebrow, unsure if I was up for a haunted house, but Autumn's excitement was infectious. ""Okay, fine,"" I said, shrugging. ""But if I end up with nightmares, I'm blaming you."" Autumn grinned, triumphant, and the four of us made plans to check out the haunted house the following weekend."
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.",36,"My mind, however, is a different story altogether. It's racing with thoughts of what could happen next, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. I try to calm myself down, reminding myself that I've been in this situation before, but it's no use. The sound of Jack's footsteps gets closer and closer, and I can sense his presence hovering over me. I wonder if he's looking at me, if he can see the fear and anxiety etched on my face. I take a deep breath and try to relax, but my body feels tense and rigid. Suddenly, I feel a gentle touch on my shoulder, and I flinch, my eyes snapping open to meet Jack's concerned gaze."
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,41,"to glance around nervously, as if he's worried someone might be listening in. I follow his gaze, but all I see is the dense forest surrounding us, the trees towering above like sentinels. I turn back to Jack, my eyes narrowing slightly. ""I'm trying to figure out what's going on,"" I whisper, my voice barely audible over the sound of the wind rustling through the leaves. ""And as for her,"" I nod toward the tent, ""I think she's in some kind of trouble. I've been trying to get her to talk, but she just keeps saying she can't remember anything."" Jack's eyes flicker with concern, and he takes a step closer to me. ""What do you mean she can't remember anything?"" he asks, his voice low and urgent. I hesitate, unsure how much to reveal, but something about Jack's expression makes me trust him. ""I think she might have amnesia,"" I say finally, the words spilling out in a rush. ""She doesn't know who she is, where she is, or how she got here. And I think someone might be trying to hurt her."" Jack's face sets in a determined expression, and he nods once, sharply. ""We need to get her out of here,"" he says. ""Now."""
"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with","the word “type.” Autumn makes a noise in the tent, and we both hold our breaths and listen.",35,"the words ""I'm sorry."" I'm not sure what he's apologizing for, but I appreciate the sentiment. He looks up at me with a mixture of exhaustion and frustration etched on his face. I can tell he's been up all night, probably thinking about the same things I have. We sit there in silence for a moment, the only sound being the creaks and groans of the old house settling around us. Finally, Jack breaks the silence, his voice barely above a whisper. ""We need to talk about what happened,"" he says, his eyes locked on mine. I nod in agreement, knowing that we can't avoid this conversation any longer."
"“Zoned out the way she does? You have been so, so…","Like last week!” Jack asks, “How could you have missed that game?”",23,"preoccupied lately, and I'm starting to get worried. Is everything okay? You've been distant, and it's like you're a million miles away, even when we're in the same room. I've tried talking to you, but you just shrug it off and change the subject. I feel like I'm losing you, and I don't know how to reach you anymore. We used to be so close, so connected, but now it feels like there's this huge gap between us. I want to help you, to support you, but I don't know what's going on or how to do that. Can you please, please talk to me and tell me what's wrong?"
“Why don’t we restart the movie? We can all watch it.” Jack,gives me a look to remind me that our other conversation isn’t over.,25,"suggested, trying to lighten the mood, but Sarah just shook her head and continued to stare out the window, her eyes fixed on some distant point beyond the trees. The others exchanged uneasy glances, sensing the tension that had settled over the room. It was clear that the argument was far from over, and the movie was the last thing on anyone's mind. As the silence stretched out, Emily finally spoke up, her voice soft but firm. ""I think we should talk about what just happened,"" she said, her eyes locked on Sarah's back. ""We can't just ignore it and expect everything to go back to normal."" But Sarah didn't respond, didn't even flinch, and the room fell silent once again."
"I walk Jack to his car, and when he turns to me with that","look on his face, I know what he’s going to say. I open my mouth.",29,"smile, I feel a flutter in my chest that I quickly try to brush off as mere friendship. We've been friends for years, after all, and I'm not about to let some silly infatuation ruin that. But as he leans in to give me a hug goodbye, his warm breath on my ear sends shivers down my spine, and I wonder if maybe, just maybe, my feelings for him go far beyond friendship. I push the thought aside and step back, trying to play it cool as he gets into his car and drives away, leaving me standing there feeling more confused than ever."
"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke. Surely the school administrators knew we had always been together, were meant to be together. Surely, if I looked around the cafeteria, she would be there?",61,"together was a bigger adjustment than I had anticipated. We had always sat together in elementary school, sharing sandwiches and stories, and the silence of eating alone was a bit disorienting. I scanned the cafeteria, searching for a friendly face, and spotted Jack sitting by himself at a table near the window. He looked just as lost as I felt, and I decided to take a chance and introduce myself. As I walked over, he looked up and caught my eye, flashing a tentative smile. I slid into the seat across from him, and we started talking, exchanging stories about our summers and our families. Before I knew it, the bell rang, signaling the end of lunch, and I realized I had found a new friend. Over the next few weeks, Jack and I grew closer, bonding over our shared love of video games and science fiction novels. We started sitting together at lunch every day, and soon, a group of other kids began to join us, drawn in by our laughter and conversation. Autumn and I still hung out, of course, but having Jack as a friend added a new dimension to my social life, and I was grateful for that chance encounter in the cafeteria."
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time. I didn’t sit down because I recognized Jack though; I simply sat at the first empty seat, defeated. But Jack remembered me. He asked me if I ever watched pro soccer. I said yeah, not really interested in conversation, not really listening, wondering what Autumn was doing.",97,"free rein. I had been looking forward to this lunch all morning, and I was starving. Jack, on the other hand, seemed completely uninterested in the food in front of him, and instead, he was staring intently at me. I felt a shiver run down my spine as our eyes met, and for a moment, I forgot about the noise and chaos of the cafeteria. It was as if time had stood still, and all that existed was the two of us, locked in a silent understanding. I broke the spell by clearing my throat and asking him if he was okay, and he blinked, looking away, his expression softening into a gentle smile. We spent the rest of lunch talking about everything and nothing, our conversation flowing effortlessly, like we had known each other for years. As we finished up and prepared to part ways, Jack turned to me and asked if I wanted to grab a snack with him after school. I agreed, and we made plans to meet up at the corner store near my house. Little did I know, that casual invitation would be the start of a beautiful friendship, one that would change my life in ways I never could have imagined."
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.",92,"he looked at me with a mixture of confusion and curiosity. I could tell he was trying to process the difference between the Autumn he had imagined and the one standing in front of him. Autumn, however, seemed completely at ease, her bright smile never wavering as she walked towards us. ""It's great to finally meet you, Jack,"" she said, her voice warm and friendly. Jack's eyes darted back to me, and I could sense his unspoken questions. I knew I had to intervene before things got awkward. ""Hey, let's grab some coffee and catch up,"" I suggested, trying to steer the conversation towards safer topics. As we walked to the coffee shop, Jack couldn't help sneaking glances at Autumn, his expression a mix of fascination and bewilderment. Autumn, on the other hand, chatted away, seemingly oblivious to the commotion she had caused. I found myself wondering how much I should reveal about her transformation, and whether Jack would ever be able to see her the way I did – as the same kind and caring person she had always been."
"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face. He didn’t believe that Autumn was—or ever had been—my friend. The daughter of my mom’s best friend, who was around a lot? Sure. But he thought I had deluded myself into believing this hot girl was my friend.",79,"his face, and it made me feel like I was the one who was broken, not him. I watched as he walked up the path to his front door, his shoulders slumped in defeat. I couldn't help but wonder what he was thinking, what he was feeling. Was he relieved to be going home, to be escaping the chaos that had erupted at the party? Or was he, like me, replaying the events of the night over and over in his head, trying to make sense of it all? I didn't have the answers, and I probably never would. As I pulled away from the curb and headed back to my own house, I couldn't shake the feeling that things would never be the same again. The night had changed us, had changed me, in ways that I was still trying to understand. I thought about calling Emily, about talking to her about what had happened, but something held me back. Maybe it was the fear of reliving the pain, or maybe it was the fear of hearing her say something that would make me realize just how much I had lost. Whatever the reason, I decided to face the darkness alone, to try and make sense of it all on my own. The drive home was a blur, my mind consumed by thoughts of what could have been, of what should have been. I pulled into my driveway, turned off the engine, and just sat there, staring out into the night. The stars were shining brightly above, but they offered no comfort, no solace. I was alone, and I was lost, and I didn't know how to find my way back."
"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.",58,"lined the walls, and the scent of pumpkin spice wafted through the air. I baked pies and made warm apple cider, all in an attempt to show Jack that Autumn was a season to be cherished. I took him on hayrides and to corn mazes, and even convinced him to join me for a game of touch football on a crisp, cool afternoon. As the weeks went by, I could see the skepticism in Jack's eyes begin to fade, replaced by a growing appreciation for the simple joys of the season. He started to notice the way the sunlight filtered through the changing leaves, casting a warm glow over everything, and the sound of children's laughter as they jumped in piles of fallen leaves. And as the days grew shorter, and the nights grew cooler, Jack finally turned to me and said, ""You know, I think I'm starting to get it. Autumn isn't so bad after all."" I smiled, feeling a sense of triumph, knowing that I had helped my friend to see the beauty in a season he had once despised."
"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still","friends. On the last day of school before winter break, Jack finally said something. I cannot remember what I had been telling him, only that it had been about Autumn.",59,"friends. The truth was, I wasn't even sure myself. Autumn and I had grown apart over the years, and I had often found myself wondering if our friendship was still relevant. I thought back to the good times we had shared, the laughter, the adventures, and the late-night conversations. But as time went on, life had taken us in different directions, and we had slowly lost touch. I remembered the last time we spoke, it was brief and superficial, a mere exchange of pleasantries on social media. I couldn't help but feel that our friendship had become a relic of the past, a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era. And yet, a part of me still held on to the hope that we could rekindle what we once had, that our friendship was still a flame that could be fanned back to life. But for now, it remained a flicker, a distant memory that I couldn't quite grasp."
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah? Let’s take this outside,” and hurried me out.",41,"to start rambling on about how he had forgotten his math homework, or how he had just seen his crush, Emily, in the hallway, but instead, he just shook his head and muttered something under his breath. I raised an eyebrow, intrigued by his unusual behavior. ""Dude, what's wrong?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice low as the other students began to file out of the locker room. Jack hesitated, glancing around nervously before leaning in close. ""I saw something weird this morning,"" he whispered, his eyes darting back and forth. ""Something that's been bugging me ever since."" I felt a shiver run down my spine as I wondered what could have gotten Jack so spooked. ""What was it?"" I pressed, my curiosity piqued. Jack took a deep breath before launching into a hushed explanation, his words tumbling out in a rush. ""I was walking to school, and I saw this...this thing. It was tall, with glowing eyes. It was standing by the old oak tree on Elm Street."" I raised an eyebrow, skeptical. ""A thing with glowing eyes? You mean, like a person in a costume or something?"" Jack shook his head vigorously. ""No way, it was not human. I'm telling you, it was something weird. And it was watching me."" I felt a shiver run down my spine as I tried to process what Jack was telling me. Could it be true? Or was Jack just pulling my leg? I decided to play it cool, to see if Jack would crack a smile and reveal it was all a joke. But as I looked into his eyes, I saw only fear and conviction. Whatever Jack had seen, he believed it was real. And that realization sent a chill down my spine."
"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind","yourself, ‘Autumn is where she wants to be right now, and that’s okay. I’m still great, and I’ll be around if she needs me.’ Hmm?” She squeezed my foot again.",59,"yourself of all the things that make you happy and special. Don't let anyone bring you down, especially not someone who doesn't even know you. You're an amazing person, and you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect. Just be yourself and don't change for anyone. You're doing great, and I'm so proud of you. Now, how about we go get some ice cream to celebrate the start of the new school year?"" Her words of encouragement and the thought of ice cream put a big smile on his face, and he felt a weight lift off his shoulders. He realized that he didn't have to let the mean words of a stranger bring him down, and that he had people in his life who truly cared about him. With renewed confidence, he walked alongside his mom, feeling happy and excited for the adventures that lay ahead."
"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly. I’d show Autumn that I wasn’t a loser without friends; Jack and I would make more friends somehow.,53,"was a sport that required a great deal of endurance and stamina, and I knew that if I could master the art of staying cool under pressure, I would be able to perform at my best. I began to focus on my breathing techniques, taking slow, deep breaths in through my nose and out through my mouth, feeling the cool air fill my lungs and calm my nerves. I also made a conscious effort to stay hydrated, drinking plenty of water before, during, and after practice to ensure that my body was functioning at its best. As I worked on my coolness, I noticed a significant improvement in my game. I was able to run faster, jump higher, and react quicker, all without getting winded or feeling overwhelmed. My teammates took notice too, and soon they were coming to me for advice on how to stay cool under pressure. I was happy to share my newfound knowledge, and together we formed a formidable team, each of us supporting and encouraging the other to be our best selves. As the season progressed, we found ourselves at the top of the league, and I knew that my newfound coolness had played a significant role in our success."
"Jack and I had worried one of us might not make it on the junior varsity team. When the lists were posted,","I searched for my name on the JV list and was devastated to not see it. Still, I was happy for Jack.",44,"we both felt a mix of relief and excitement as we scanned the names, our eyes widening as we found our own among the selected players. The days of intense tryouts and grueling practice had paid off, and we couldn't wait to start this new chapter in our high school sports careers. As we exchanged a triumphant high-five, the tension and uncertainty of the past few weeks melted away, replaced by a sense of camaraderie and shared accomplishment. We had done it, and nothing could bring us down from this high. Little did we know, this was only the beginning of an unforgettable journey, one that would test our skills, our friendship, and our resolve in ways we never thought possible."
"Jack told me later that my ability to brush off the snarky comment from that junior, my new teammate,",made me seem cool. There had been chuckles of appreciation according to him. I wasn’t sure about that though.,38,"was a defining moment in his decision to make me the team lead on the project. He said it showed that I could handle pressure and maintain a level head, even when faced with adversity. I was taken aback by this revelation, as I had simply been trying to diffuse the tension in the room. But Jack's words stuck with me, and I began to realize that my ability to remain calm under fire was a valuable asset in the high-stakes world of corporate finance. As the project progressed, I found myself drawing on this skill time and time again, using it to navigate complex negotiations and placate difficult clients. And although I never did become fast friends with that junior teammate, I came to appreciate the role he had played in helping me discover my own strengths."
"The varsity soccer team practiced on the north field, near the student parking lots. The junior varsity team practiced on the south field, closer to the circular drive where parents dropped off and picked","up kids. Even though Jack and I were on different teams, our schedules were still the same, and my mom would drive us to and from practice every day for those last weeks of summer.",69,"their children. The sound of laughter and shouts filled the air as the players ran drills and scrimmaged against each other. The varsity team's coach, a tall, imposing figure with a whistle around his neck, stood on the sidelines, offering words of encouragement and constructive criticism to his players. Nearby, the junior varsity team's coach, a younger woman with a kind smile, worked with her players on perfecting their passing technique. As the practices drew to a close, the teams began to wrap up their activities, gathering their gear and saying their goodbyes before heading off to their next classes or home. The fields, once bustling with activity, slowly emptied out, leaving behind only the faint scent of freshly cut grass and the distant hum of cars driving by on the nearby road."
"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me. I was excited to tell him that practice hadn’t been as hard as I thought.,61,"that I was going to walk home, which wasn't true, but I didn't want to be a burden. As I watched them drive away, I felt a pang of loneliness. I had been so focused on proving myself on the field that I hadn't really taken the time to get to know any of my teammates. I started the long walk home, my cleats making a rhythmic thud on the pavement. The sun was setting, casting a golden glow over the deserted streets. I felt a sense of unease wash over me as I walked, the silence a stark contrast to the cacophony of the practice field. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was an outsider, that I didn't quite fit in with the rest of the team. As I turned the corner onto my street, I saw my mom waiting for me on the porch, a look of concern etched on her face. ""Hey kiddo, how was practice?"" she asked, as I trudged up the walkway. I forced a smile, not wanting to worry her. ""It was fine,"" I said, trying to sound casual. But as we walked into the house together, I couldn't help but feel like I was hiding something, like I was pretending to be someone I wasn't."
"We all joined Jack on the low wall, waiting to get picked up. We didn’t talk that much, but the next day, as I trudged from the north field to","the south, I saw the girls by the gym door again. It was only as I approached and saw them watching me that I figured out they were waiting for me.",61,"the south field, I noticed Jack walking alongside me, his eyes fixed on the ground. He seemed lost in thought, and I didn't want to disturb him, but as we approached the old oak tree, he suddenly spoke up. ""Hey, you think we'll ever get out of this place?"" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper. I was taken aback by the question, but I tried to play it cool, shrugging my shoulders and saying, ""I don't know, man. I guess we'll just have to wait and see."" Jack nodded, his eyes still fixed on the ground, and we continued walking in silence. As we approached the south field, I could see the other guys already working, their faces sweaty and exhausted. I felt a pang of dread in my stomach, knowing that we had a long day of hard labor ahead of us. But as I glanced over at Jack, I saw a determined look in his eyes, and I knew that he was thinking the same thing I was - we had to find a way out of this place, no matter what it took."
"What if, this morning, she woke up in the tent before I thought? What if she woke up as I lifted my arm off her, then lay there wondering why I had been","touching her, why I was still lying close to her and not speaking? If that was the case, she would have—or could have—heard me say many, many, incriminating things to Jack outside the tent.",67,"holding her so tightly, only to let go without a word? What if she had been watching me, studying my face in the dim light of dawn, trying to decipher the emotions that had driven me to such a gentle yet firm grasp? Perhaps she had seen the turmoil in my eyes, the conflict that raged within me like a stormy sea. Maybe she had sensed the depth of my feelings, the longing that I had been trying to keep hidden, even from myself. As I lay there, frozen in uncertainty, she might have been searching for answers, her mind racing with questions about the nature of our relationship and the future that lay ahead. The silence between us was palpable, a living, breathing entity that pulsed with unspoken words and unresolved tensions. And in that moment, I knew that I had to find a way to bridge the gap between us, to break the silence and reveal the truth that had been hiding in my heart for so long."
"It strikes me how backward my plan sounds: give up a girl who adores me, who I love well enough, to be a disciple for a different girl who will","never fall for me. Jack has always said I’m irrational when it comes to Autumn, and maybe I should have taken him more seriously, because he was right earlier today.",60,"likely never even notice me. It's a ridiculous notion, and yet, I feel an inexplicable pull towards this other girl. Perhaps it's the thrill of the unknown, the excitement of pursuing someone who doesn't fawn all over me. Or maybe it's the fact that she seems to embody the very qualities I've been searching for in a partner - intelligence, wit, and a spark that sets my soul on fire. Whatever the reason, I find myself willing to take the risk, to give up the comfort and security of a relationship that's good, but not great, for the chance to experience something truly extraordinary. The thought sends a shiver down my spine, and I know that I have to see this through, no matter how it ends."
“I already know why you did it.” She doesn’t have to explain that part. I know she’s never wanted me like that. I don’t need to hear her,say it. “I just want to know why you had to be so cruel about it.” It’s time to face what Jack has been telling me all these years.,57,"say the words out loud. I've seen the way she looks at me, like a friend, a confidant, but never with that spark of attraction. I've tried to convince myself otherwise, to believe that maybe, just maybe, she felt the same way. But deep down, I've always known the truth. It's a painful realization, one that I've been trying to avoid for so long. I take a deep breath, preparing myself for the conversation that's about to unfold. ""It's okay,"" I say, trying to sound calmer than I feel. ""I just want to know why you felt the need to pretend."" I look at her, searching for answers in her eyes. She takes a step back, her expression a mix of guilt and sadness. ""I didn't mean to hurt you,"" she says, her voice barely above a whisper. ""I just didn't know how to tell you."" I nod, trying to process my emotions. I'm not sure what I'm feeling - anger, sadness, or maybe a mix of both. All I know is that I need to hear her out, to understand why she felt the need to lead me on. ""Tell me,"" I say, my voice firm but gentle. ""Tell me everything."""
But Autumn’s getting upset. She sits up and pulls the covers,around her protectively. She frowns at me. The birds are still singing.,23,"back over her head, trying to calm herself down, but it's no use. She can feel the tears welling up in her eyes as she thinks about the argument they had earlier. She tries to take deep breaths, but her body is shaking with sobs. She can't believe he would say such hurtful things to her. She feels a lump form in her throat as she remembers the way he looked at her, his eyes cold and unfeeling. She buries her face in the pillow, letting the tears flow freely, and wonders how things had escalated so quickly."
"“It just felt so nice not to be the weird girl anymore,”",Autumn says. “I liked being popular. We did kinda grow apart that year.”,25,"as she finally found a group of people who accepted her for who she was, quirks and all, and didn't try to change her or make her conform to societal norms. They were a motley crew, each with their own unique brand of weirdness, and they welcomed her with open arms, making her feel like she had finally found her tribe. For the first time in her life, she felt like she could be herself without fear of judgment or rejection, and it was a truly liberating experience. She no longer had to hide her true nature or pretend to be someone she wasn't, and it was a weight off her shoulders. She was free to be weird, and it felt amazing."
“I don’t like him.” I shrugged. “I told you before: Autumn’s an old friend from when we were kids. Sucks that she,"likes such a show-off.” I shrugged again. Up ahead, Autumn and her friends were waiting at the crosswalk for the light to change.",45,"ended up with him, but I don't think she's happy. I've been trying to get her to talk about it, but she just changes the subject. I'm worried about her, to be honest. We've been friends for so long, and I can tell when something's bothering her. I just wish she'd open up to me like she used to. Maybe I'll try calling her again later and see if she'll talk to me. I just hope she's doing okay. The thought of her being stuck in a bad relationship is really getting to me. I've seen the way he looks at her, like he owns her or something. It gives me the chills. I just want my friend back, you know? The happy, carefree Autumn I grew up with, not this shell of a person she's become."
My face must change because she smiles and clambers into my lap. We wrap our arms around each other and settle in.,"After a moment, she says, “You know, I never thought this would happen either. When Jack told me—” and then she stops.",44,"The warmth of her body seeps into mine, and I feel a sense of calm wash over me. As we sit there, I gently stroke her hair, and she nuzzles her head into the crook of my neck. The world outside recedes, and all that's left is the gentle rise and fall of our chests, the soft rustle of our breathing. In this quiet, intimate space, time stands still, and I am acutely aware of the preciousness of this moment, the beauty of this tiny, fragile human who has claimed my heart. As I hold her close, I feel a deep sense of gratitude for this little life, for the laughter and the tears, the triumphs and the struggles. And I know that no matter what the future holds, this moment, right here, right now, is enough."
"“Sorry,” I say. “I was trying to decide whether I should kill Jack for telling you I was",into you or if I should kill him for telling you that I wasn’t into you. Tough call.”,36,"in love with you, or if I should just let him live and deal with the consequences of his big mouth later. I look at you, and I can see the surprise written all over your face. You're trying to process this new information, and I can tell you're not sure how to react. I take a deep breath and decide to just go with it. ""I guess the cat's out of the bag now,"" I say, trying to sound casual despite the fact that my heart is racing. ""I've had feelings for you for a while now, but I didn't know how to tell you."" I pause, studying your reaction. You look like you're in shock, but I can see a hint of a smile playing on your lips. I take that as a good sign and continue. ""I know this may come as a shock to you, but I couldn't keep it inside anymore. I had to tell you, no matter how scared I was."" I take a step closer to you, my heart pounding in my chest. ""So, now that you know, what do you think?"" I ask, my voice barely above a whisper."
"“Yeah,” I admit. Jack was protecting me, but there’s no way he believed that I was over Autumn. I’m wondering now though. “What would","you have done if he’d told you the truth, that I was”—I try to remember how Jack put it before—“bonkers in love with you?”",48,"you have done to make him think that?"" I ask, my voice barely above a whisper. I'm not sure why I'm even asking, but a part of me wants to know what Jack saw in me that made him think I was ready to move on. Was it something I said? Something I did? I rack my brain, trying to remember every conversation, every interaction we had after Autumn left. But my mind is a jumbled mess, and I just can't seem to pinpoint anything. I look up at him, searching for answers in his eyes, but they're guarded, giving nothing away. ""You were just so...different,"" he says finally, his voice low and husky. ""You were smiling again, laughing. You seemed...happy."" I feel a pang in my chest at his words. Happy? Was I really happy? I thought I was just going through the motions, pretending to be okay so that everyone would leave me alone. But maybe, just maybe, I was more okay than I thought. Maybe Jack saw something in me that I didn't even see in myself."
"“I think my mother has a special bottle of champagne hidden away for just this occasion,” I say. I’m only partially joking. Mom has labeled some of her alcohol, like","for when George W. Bush leaves office and stuff. One expensive one said, “Finny-Autumn Day or NYE 2010.” At the time, I was glad she’d made alternative plans for it.",60,"the expensive scotch she only breaks out for holidays, but I wouldn't put it past her to have a secret stash of bubbly for a moment like this. My dad chuckles and shakes his head, ""I wouldn't be surprised if she does."" He pauses, lost in thought for a moment before speaking up again, ""You know, I remember when your mom and I first met, we used to dream about moments like this. We'd talk about the kind of life we wanted to build together, the kind of family we wanted to have. And now, here we are, celebrating this incredible achievement. It's surreal."" I smile, feeling a sense of pride and gratitude towards my parents. They've always been my biggest supporters, and I know that this moment is just as much theirs as it is mine. I glance over at my mom, who's beaming with pride, and I can tell she's already planning the celebration in her head. I wouldn't be surprised if she pulls out all the stops – the good china, the fancy glasses, the works. This is going to be a night to remember."
"“Everything,” she says, which can’t be true. I didn’t even know everything",until last night. And Jack wouldn’t have called her before I arrived.,24,"myself, and I was the one who had been keeping track of all the things she had been doing, or so I thought. She looks at me with a mischievous glint in her eye, as if daring me to challenge her claim. I raise an eyebrow, intrigued despite myself, and ask her to explain. She leans in, a sly smile spreading across her face, and begins to recount a list of things that I had no idea she knew about, let alone understood. As she speaks, I feel a growing sense of unease, wondering how she could possibly know all of this, and what else she might be hiding."
"“Syl,” I start, but I don’t know where to begin. I stay","on the highway, passing all the exits that could take us home.",24,"silent for a moment, trying to gather my thoughts. Syl looks at me expectantly, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. I take a deep breath and try to start again, but the words get stuck in my throat. I clear my throat and begin slowly, ""I've been thinking a lot about what happened, and I have some questions."" Syl's expression changes to one of concern, and she leans in closer, her voice barely above a whisper, ""What kind of questions?"""
"“Syl,” I say as I drive toward her house, speeding up a bit. “Don’t be ridiculous.",I’ve been enough of a bastard already. I’m not letting you walk home in the rain.”,32,"“You can’t honestly think that I’m going to let you walk home in the dark, especially after what happened last week. I know you’re trying to be independent, but come on, it’s not safe. Besides, I’m already here, so just get in the car and let’s get you home.” I glance over at her, trying to gauge her reaction, but she’s still standing there, her arms crossed and a stubborn look on her face. I sigh and pull over to the side of the road, putting the car in park. “Syl, seriously, what’s going on with you? You’re not still mad about what I said the other day, are you?” I ask, trying to keep my tone light, but she just shakes her head and looks away. I realize that I’m going to have to try harder to get through to her."
"“Lexy,” I say. It’s too fucking early for her to call. It doesn’t matter if we’re sleeping","together again. “Stop being a drama queen,” I groan into the phone and roll over in bed.",34,"in or not, she knows better than to call before noon. I roll over and grab my phone, rubbing the sleep from my eyes as I answer. ""What's up, Lex?"" I mumble, trying to sound more awake than I feel. There's a pause on the other end of the line, and for a moment, I wonder if she's hung up on me. But then I hear her take a deep breath and launch into whatever crisis is currently plaguing her. I listen, still trying to shake off the remnants of sleep, as she talks a mile a minute about something that sounds vaguely familiar but doesn't quite register. I'm about to ask her to slow down when she drops a bombshell that makes my eyes snap open. ""Wait, what? When did this happen?"" I sit up in bed, suddenly wide awake and alert."
I’m still standing in Finn’s yard staring at the grass he’ll never mow again.,"I don’t know how long it’s been when a woman’s voice says, “Jack, right?”",28,"The memories of our childhood laughter and summer barbecues still linger in the air, but now they're tainted with the bitter taste of loss and longing. I can almost hear the sound of his lawnmower roaring to life, the smell of freshly cut grass wafting through the neighborhood, but it's all just a distant memory now. I take a deep breath, trying to hold back the tears that are welling up in my eyes, and begin to walk towards the old oak tree where we used to play hide and seek. The tree's branches seem to stretch out like withered arms, as if mourning the loss of my dear friend. I reach out and touch the rough bark, feeling a sense of emptiness wash over me. The world seems to have moved on, but I'm still stuck in this moment, frozen in time, trying to come to terms with the fact that Finn is really gone."
"“The arrangements still have to be made, but I’m sure we’ll see","you at the wake, Jack,” she says before going inside. “Thanks again.”",24,"each other again soon. I'm really looking forward to it, and I'm sure we'll have a great time catching up and reminiscing about old times. We can finalize the details later, but for now, let's just say that it's going to be a fantastic reunion. I've already started thinking about all the things we can do and the places we can visit, and I'm sure you'll love the ideas I have in mind. It's going to be a real blast from the past, and I just know we'll create some amazing new memories together."
"There’s an odd aura around us as we approach. I feel so young, like I’m being escorted into kindergarten, and I’m resentful and grateful all over again. My parents shoulder themselves on either side of me, and I can tell all their focus","is on me. They don’t speak, but it’s strange: the closer we get to the horrible box, to the grinning photograph of my friend that sits on top, it’s like I can feel my parents saying to me, See, Jack? This is death.",86,"is on me, their eyes darting back and forth, checking for any signs of distress or anxiety. I try to reassure them with a weak smile, but it only seems to make them more anxious. We're standing outside a large, imposing building with stone walls and tall, narrow windows that seem to stare down at us like empty eyes. The entrance is a heavy wooden door with a large iron knocker in the shape of a lion's head, its mouth open in a fierce snarl. My heart is racing as my parents push open the door and we step inside. The interior is just as intimidating as the exterior, with high ceilings and long, dark corridors that seem to stretch on forever. We're greeted by a stern-looking woman with a clipboard, who eyes us up and down before nodding curtly and leading us deeper into the building. I can feel my parents' tension radiating off them like heat, and I know they're just as nervous as I am. We're shown into a small, windowless room with a single chair in the center, and the woman gestures for me to sit down. My parents exchange a worried glance, but I try to reassure them with a brave smile. I take a deep breath and sit down, trying to prepare myself for whatever is about to happen next."
"“You don’t have to pretend that we were more than friends of convenience,",Jack. I’m tired of people pretending to care more about me than they do.”,27,"because I know that's all we were, and I'm okay with that. What I'm not okay with is you acting like you're doing me a favor by being here, like you're somehow better than me because you're still in the game. Newsflash, buddy: we're both just trying to survive in this crazy world, and if we can't be honest with each other about our intentions, then what's the point of even having each other's backs?"
"“Uh-huh.” I take a gulp of coffee, which hasn’t quite cooled and burns down my throat. “So my guess is that’s what Sylv","said to you, and then you pushed back, because of course you did, and that’s when she said what you said to me, huh?”",47,"iana was trying to tell me, but I didn't quite catch it. I look over at her, but she's still staring out the window, her eyes fixed on some point in the distance. I try to follow her gaze, but all I see is the usual cityscape - towering skyscrapers, crowded streets, and the occasional flash of neon lights. I turn back to her, wondering what's going on in that head of hers. ""Sylviana, what's wrong?"" I ask, trying to keep my voice gentle. She doesn't respond, just keeps staring out the window like she's in a trance. I try to shake off the feeling of unease that's growing inside me, telling myself it's just my imagination playing tricks on me. But the silence between us is starting to feel oppressive, and I find myself fidgeting in my seat. I take another sip of my coffee, trying to focus on the bitter taste and the warmth spreading through my chest. But my mind keeps wandering back to Sylviana, and what could be bothering her so much."
"“Hey,” I say as I approach, careful to stand back so that it’s obvious I’m not trying to","cut in line for the keg. Maybe he’s in his own head, but Trevor blanches for a moment.",36,"invade her space. She looks up, startled, and for a moment our eyes lock in a way that makes my heart skip a beat. I feel a rush of adrenaline as I take in the sight of her, her hair messy and her eyes red-rimmed from crying. I can tell she's been through a lot, and my instincts scream at me to comfort her, to wrap my arms around her and tell her everything will be okay. But I don't. I just stand there, frozen, as she looks away and tries to compose herself. ""Hey,"" she says finally, her voice barely above a whisper. ""I didn't expect to see you here."" I take a deep breath and try to play it cool, but my mind is racing with questions. What is she doing here? Is she okay? Does she still feel the same way about me? I push the thoughts aside and focus on the present moment, trying to come up with a response that won't scare her off."
"That’s the kind of high school memory I want to live in tonight, so even though I have no idea what Chloe","was saying about me to her friend, I head over. A few of the girls rush off, but one of her friends stays.",45,"is doing here, I'm going to pretend she's just another face in the crowd, a familiar smile that I can exchange a few pleasantries with before we both move on to the next conversation. I take a deep breath, letting the music wash over me, and make my way through the throng of people, nodding and smiling as I go. The lights are flashing, the beat is pulsating, and for a moment, I let myself get lost in the rhythm, forgetting about everything except the music and the memories. I'm not thinking about college applications, or my parents' expectations, or the looming uncertainty of my future. I'm just a high school student, letting loose on a Friday night, surrounded by friends and acquaintances, all of us united in our desire to have a good time. As I dance, I catch glimpses of people I've known for years, some of whom I've grown close to, others who are more like acquaintances, but in this moment, it doesn't matter. We're all just a bunch of teenagers, enjoying the freedom of being young and carefree. I spin around, laughing, and that's when I see him - a guy I've had a crush on for what feels like forever, standing across the room, looking at me with a smile that makes my heart skip a beat."
"After the words are out of my mouth, I try to turn them into a joke with a laugh, but that",makes it worse. Chloe’s and her friend’s faces go through a strobe light sequence of reactions before settling back to pity.,42,"only makes things more awkward, and I can tell by the look on her face that she's not buying it. The tension in the air is palpable, and I can feel my face growing hotter by the second. I try to think of something, anything, to say to diffuse the situation, but my mind is a complete blank. The silence stretches out between us, feeling like an eternity, until finally, she speaks up, her voice low and even. ""You know, I think we need to talk about this,"" she says, her words dripping with a seriousness that makes my heart sink. I nod, feeling a sense of trepidation wash over me, and we both sit down, the weight of our unspoken words hanging in the air like a challenge."
“You know? How you showed up at soccer practice like that?” Chloe touches my arm in a,"way that I used to think meant a girl was flirting, but now I’m not so sure.",34,"gentle gesture, and I feel a rush of memories flooding back. I remember the day vividly, the way the sunlight reflected off the dew-kissed grass, the sound of the coach's whistle piercing the air, and the smell of freshly cut grass wafting through the atmosphere. I recall the feeling of nervousness mixed with excitement as I stepped onto the field, my heart pounding in my chest. Chloe's eyes sparkle with amusement as she continues, ""You were so determined, so focused. You had this fire in your eyes that I'd never seen before. What was going through your mind that day?"" I take a deep breath, letting the memories wash over me, and begin to recount the story, the words spilling out of me like a pent-up flood."
"I think my dad calls it an Irish goodbye when you don’t tell anyone you are leaving, and that’s what I’m","trying to do, but halfway to my car, I hear Kyle call my name. I turn, and he jogs up to me.",43,"doing right now. I'm just going to slip out the back door and make my way to the car without saying a word to anyone. It's not that I'm trying to be rude or inconsiderate, it's just that I don't want to get caught up in a long, drawn-out goodbye. I've got a long drive ahead of me and I need to get going. Besides, I've already said my goodbyes to the people who matter most, so I don't feel too bad about sneaking out. As I make my way to the car, I can feel a sense of excitement and nervousness building up inside me. I'm not sure what the future holds, but I'm ready to take on whatever comes next. I take a deep breath, start the engine, and pull out of the driveway, leaving the familiar surroundings behind. The open road stretches out before me, full of possibilities and promise. I feel a sense of freedom that I've never felt before, and I know that this is just the beginning of an incredible journey."
"“It’s okay, Kyle.” Because it kind of is. I’m glad that no one hates me, but I’m also glad that the guys on",the team aren’t friends I should be concerned about losing. I clap Kyle on the shoulder. “Thanks for the invite. Good luck in Cali.”,47,"the team aren't intimidated by me. I've seen it before, where a girl joins the team and everyone's too scared to talk to her or make a joke around her because they don't want to be seen as sexist or whatever. But these guys, they're not like that. They're treating me like one of the guys, and it's actually kind of nice. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm still a girl and I still like to be treated with respect, but it's nice to be able to joke around and not have to worry about someone getting offended. I glance over at Kyle, who's still looking at me with this concerned expression, and I smile. ""Really, Kyle, it's okay. I can handle myself."" He nods, seeming to accept my reassurance, and turns back to the game. I follow his gaze, watching as the other team makes their next move. We're down by two points, but I'm confident we can catch up. I've been practicing my three-pointers and I'm feeling pretty good about my chances. I take a deep breath, focus on the game, and get ready to make my next move."
"The next morning, I tell my parents about catching up with Kyle and the guys on the","team, how it was nice to see everyone but how I’m starting to get more excited about college.",35,"weekend and they seem pleased that I'm reconnecting with old friends. My mom asks if I've given any more thought to college, and I tell her I've been looking into a few schools, but I'm still undecided. She nods understandingly and says we can discuss it more later. My dad, on the other hand, is more interested in hearing about Kyle's new business venture and asks me to invite him over for dinner soon. I agree, knowing that my dad is always eager to offer his entrepreneurial advice. As we finish breakfast, I feel a sense of relief that the conversation wasn't too intense, and I'm grateful for the distraction from my own worries about the future."
"“Well, if we don’t see you again, have a good semester!” Mrs. Carter says.",The tears in her eyes glitter. “Let us know if you ever need anything!”,28,"She smiles warmly and waves goodbye as I turn to leave, the sound of her voice and the hum of the fluorescent lights fading into the background as I step out into the crisp morning air. The cool breeze carries the scent of freshly cut grass and the distant chirping of birds, a stark contrast to the sterile atmosphere of the school's office. I take a deep breath, feeling a mix of emotions as I begin my journey, the uncertainty of what lies ahead tempered by the excitement of new possibilities. As I walk away from the school, I can't help but wonder what the future holds, the memories of the past few years slowly fading like the receding tide, leaving behind a sense of anticipation and trepidation."
I give it enough time that Brett’s parents would have to be seriously unreasonable to still,be hanging around. My fingers and toes are wrinkled raisins by the time I get out.,32,"be holding a grudge, and I make sure to bring a gift, a bottle of wine that I know they like, to help break the ice. As I pull up to their house, I can feel a mix of emotions swirling inside me - anxiety, nervousness, and a hint of excitement. I take a deep breath, grab the wine, and step out of the car, hoping that this visit will be a step towards healing and reconciliation. The front door opens, and Brett's mom greets me with a warm smile, which immediately puts me at ease. We exchange pleasantries, and I hand her the wine, which she thanks me for graciously. As we step inside, I notice that the atmosphere is tense, but not as strained as I had anticipated. Brett's dad is sitting in his favorite armchair, looking a bit stern, but his eyes soften slightly as he sees me. We make small talk for a while, discussing everything from the weather to our jobs, before Brett's mom suggests we sit down for dinner. The meal is delicious, and the conversation flows more easily as we eat. I can sense that Brett's parents are trying to make an effort, and I appreciate their willingness to put the past behind us. As the evening wears on, we start to discuss more serious topics, including Brett's future plans and my role in his life. The conversation is constructive, and I feel a sense of hope that we can finally move forward, as a family."
"It’s only nine o’clock, but I hope this Brett guy is asleep. When I get to","the room, I decide he may as well be asleep, because he’s reading the new student manual.",33,"the address he gave me, I'll try to sneak in quietly and get this over with. I've been driving for hours, and the last thing I need is some awkward conversation. I just want to drop off the package and get back on the road before traffic gets bad. As I pull up to the house, I notice that it's a small, cozy-looking place with a big tree in the front yard. The porch light is off, but I can see a faint glow coming from one of the windows. I hope that's just a nightlight or something, and not Brett waiting up for me. I take a deep breath, grab the package, and step out of the car."
Brett keeps a picture of himself in a frame on his desk. It’s one of those,"dopey baseball card pics, and he looks about fourteen or so. Must have been a stellar season.",33,"old-fashioned frames with the gold trim and the velvet backing, the kind that was popular back in the 70s. He's not really sure why he keeps it there, but it's been a fixture on his desk for as long as he can remember. Sometimes, when he's feeling particularly stressed or overwhelmed, he'll catch a glimpse of the photo out of the corner of his eye and do a double take, momentarily forgetting that it's just a picture of himself. The photo shows him as a young man, with a mop of messy brown hair and a bright, cheeky grin. He's standing in front of a beach sunset, with the waves crashing against the shore behind him. It's a carefree, idyllic moment, frozen in time, and Brett often finds himself wondering what his younger self would think if he knew what the future held."
"So that first Saturday at college, I leave Brett, the middle school baseball star, sleeping on his side of the room",and head to the dining hall. I scarf half a bagel and some juice and head out to scout my new route.,43,"and head to the student union to meet up with my new classmates. As I walk across campus, I notice the mix of nervous and excited chatter filling the air. Everyone seems to be trying to make a good impression, and I'm no exception. I take a deep breath, put on a friendly smile, and push open the door to the student union. The room is bustling with people, and I scan the crowd, searching for familiar faces. That's when I see her - a girl with bright pink hair and a warm smile, sitting at a table by the window. She catches my eye and waves me over, and I feel a spark of connection. I make my way through the crowd, introducing myself to people along the way, and finally reach her table. ""Hey, I'm Emily,"" she says, extending her hand. ""I'm so glad you could make it. I was starting to think I was going to be the only one here without a social life."" I laugh and take a seat, feeling a sense of relief wash over me. Maybe this college thing won't be so bad after all."
"Which I don’t think I’m going to have to worry about today. All week, people have been handing me flyers for various official and unofficial welcome parties that took",place last night. Brett woke me up when he stumbled home close to dawn. It seems likely he went rather than fell asleep watching TV in the common room.,58,"place all over the city, and I've been invited to a few of them. I'm thinking of attending the one at the student union, if only because it's within walking distance of my dorm and I've heard the food is decent. I've also been told that it's a great way to meet new people, which is something I'm definitely looking to do. I've already met a few of my floormates, but I'm sure there are plenty of other interesting people on campus that I haven't met yet. I'm a bit nervous about it, to be honest - I've never been the most outgoing person, and the thought of walking into a room full of strangers can be a bit daunting. But I'm determined to make the most of my time here, and that means putting myself out there and taking a few risks. So, I'll probably grab a shower, throw on some decent clothes, and head over to the student union to see what all the fuss is about."
"Sometimes I see Brett the boring on campus at the Frisbee golf games or outdoor painting workshops, so I guess he’s branched out from dorm activities. He has","remained a mystery I do not want to solve, though it still bothers me that he feels the same about me, since he never gave me a chance.",56,"found a new group of friends who share his interests, and it's nice to see him smiling and laughing with people who appreciate his quirky sense of humor. I've even joined in on a few occasions, and we've had some great conversations about everything from art to music to our favorite TV shows. Brett's still a bit awkward at times, but he's definitely coming out of his shell, and it's been amazing to witness his transformation. He's still not the most adventurous person, but he's learning to take risks and try new things, which is more than I can say for some of our other classmates who seem stuck in a rut. I'm glad I've had the chance to get to know Brett better, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for him."
"“Met a guy from Taiwan last night. He seemed cool.” I’d met him in the elevator. He liked my Zelda shirt, and","we’d talked for about twenty seconds before we got off and walked to opposite ends of the floor, but it still counts.",44,"we started talking about video games. He was a huge fan of the series and had even imported a few of the Japanese games that weren't available in the US. We exchanged numbers, and he invited me to a gaming meetup the following week. I agreed, and we parted ways when the elevator stopped on my floor. I didn't think much of it at the time, but that chance encounter would end up changing my life in ways I never could have imagined. Little did I know, this guy from Taiwan would introduce me to a whole new world of gaming enthusiasts, and we would go on to create something truly remarkable together."
"As I get off the elevator, it occurs to me that Brett will probably be in our room and not expecting me. My","schedule has been pretty exact these past weeks. If he’s jerking off, he’d at least lock the door. And since the knob turns—",46,"heart starts racing at the thought of surprising him, and I quicken my pace as I make my way down the hall. I fumble for the key card in my purse, my hands shaking slightly with anticipation. I take a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, and slide the card into the lock. The door clicks open, and I push it wide, calling out his name. There's no response, and for a moment, I wonder if I've made a mistake. But then I see him, sprawled out on the bed, fast asleep. A smile spreads across my face as I take in the sight of him, and I feel a rush of love and affection. I creep closer, trying not to wake him, and gently sit down beside him on the bed. I watch him sleep for a moment, taking in the peaceful expression on his face, before gently reaching out to brush a strand of hair out of his eyes. He stirs, and I freeze, holding my breath as he slowly opens his eyes and looks up at me. A sleepy smile spreads across his face, and he reaches out to pull me into a hug. ""Hey,"" he whispers, his voice husky with sleep. ""I didn't expect you to be back so soon."" I hug him back, feeling a sense of relief and happiness wash over me. ""I know,"" I reply, ""I managed to get away earlier than I thought."" We sit there for a moment, holding each other, before Brett pulls back and looks at me with a curious expression. ""So, how was your day?"" he asks, and I launch into a story about my adventures, feeling grateful to be back with him and to have someone to share my experiences with."
"Brett tries to play it off like he’s been reading the textbook on his lap,",but the framed picture he’d been holding clatters as he sets it back on the desk.,31,"but his eyes keep drifting back to the window, where the sunlight casts a warm glow over the quad, and he can't help but feel a pang of restlessness, a sense that there's more to life than the dry words on the page in front of him. He's always been the type of person who learns by doing, not by reading, and the thought of spending the next few hours stuck in this stuffy classroom is almost too much to bear. As he gazes out the window, he starts to daydream about all the things he'd rather be doing - playing guitar, hiking in the woods, or just hanging out with friends - anything to escape the monotony of the lecture hall."
"“You won’t,” Brett says. He looks directly at me from across the table,","his food forgotten. He’s so certain. “You won’t forget. You’ll never forget,” he says.",27,"his eyes narrowing slightly as if daring me to contradict him. I feel a surge of frustration at his words, but I try to keep my cool, knowing that getting defensive will only escalate the situation. I take a deep breath and lean back in my chair, trying to appear nonchalant despite the tension building inside me. ""And why's that?"" I ask, my voice even, but with a hint of challenge. Brett smirks, seeming to enjoy the fact that he's gotten under my skin. ""Because you're not capable of it,"" he says, his tone dripping with condescension. I feel my anger spike, but I force myself to stay calm, knowing that I need to think clearly if I'm going to come out on top in this conversation."
"“She tried to kill herself. She survived, but she’s in the hospital.” She sighs. “Taylor",told me. I don’t even know how she found out. She thought I’d be happy.”,30,"was visibly shaken by the news, her eyes welling up with tears as she struggled to process the weight of her friend's desperate actions. She felt a wave of guilt wash over her, wondering if there was something she could have done to prevent this, if there had been signs she had missed or ignored. The thought of her friend lying in a hospital bed, fighting for her life, was almost too much to bear. She took a deep breath and tried to compose herself, knowing she needed to be strong for her friend and her family during this difficult time. She asked for the hospital's name and room number, already planning her visit and the words of comfort she would offer when she saw her friend again."
"“If I didn’t offer, then I should have been guilted,” I say. “I’m telling","you, Sylv, I really should have said something after I saw her last weekend.”",28,"you, I was raised to be polite and considerate, and not offering would have been a breach of those values. My mother always taught me that good manners are essential in any social interaction, and I've tried to live by those principles my whole life. I remember her saying, 'It's always better to err on the side of kindness and generosity, even if it means putting yourself out a little.' So, in this situation, I felt like I had to offer, even if it wasn't necessarily convenient for me."
"“Yeah, she slept in a little, so when it was time to take Dave to school, I went to the crib, and she was so still, I really thought that she wasn’t breathing. When I picked her up,","she didn’t stir for a second, so for this horrible moment, I really, really thought she was gone.” She laughs. “But then she woke up and was so grumpy with me! She must have been having a good dream.”",77,"she was so limp, and I just knew something was wrong. I tried to shake her awake, but she wouldn't budge. Panic started to set in as I quickly checked her pulse and breathing again. I remember my heart racing and my mind going blank, thinking the worst. I immediately called 911 and tried to remain calm while explaining the situation to the operator. The wait for the ambulance felt like an eternity, and I couldn't help but think about all the what-ifs. When the paramedics finally arrived, they quickly took her from me and began assessing her condition. I was in a daze, watching as they worked to revive her, my mind filled with fear and uncertainty. The next few minutes were a blur as I followed the ambulance to the hospital, praying that she would be okay. The hospital waiting room was a whirlwind of emotions, with family members and friends gathering, all of us anxiously waiting for any news about her condition. The doctor finally emerged, looking somber, and I knew that the news wasn't good. My world came crashing down as he explained that she had suffered a severe case of SIDS, and we were lucky to have caught it in time. The road to recovery was long and arduous, but with the help of the medical team and our loved ones, we were able to get through it together."
"Once she is free, the baby stops crying, but seemingly only out of confusion. “Beba?” She waits for me to do something, but I don’t","know what to do, so I continue to hold her from under her armpits out in front of me. “Meh?” she tries again and whimpers.",50,"know what to do. I look around the room, hoping to find some sort of instruction manual or a clue as to how to care for this tiny human being. But there's nothing. Just me, the baby, and an eerie silence. I take a deep breath and try to remember what I've seen in movies and TV shows. I gently pick up the baby and cradle her in my arms, trying to mimic the soothing motions I've seen mothers do. To my surprise, she starts to calm down, her tiny chest rising and falling with each breath. I look down at her and our eyes meet. For a moment, we just stare at each other, and I feel a strange sense of connection. I whisper ""Beba"" back to her, and she blinks slowly, as if acknowledging me. I take a step forward, and then another, trying to find my footing in this new role. But as I move, I realize I have no idea where I'm going or what I'm doing. The baby seems to sense my uncertainty and starts to fuss again. I try to shush her, but she only cries louder. I feel a wave of panic wash over me, and I wonder if I'm truly cut out for this."
"“I guess I thought that Dave or our love and the life we were building together would be enough. I knew it would be hard,","but I thought that while we were working and saving money for the future together, we’d be more together? Maybe doing better than we are now?”",51,"but I had no idea it would be this hard. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of uncertainty, with no lifeline in sight. Every day was a struggle, every conversation a minefield, every decision a potential landmine waiting to blow our relationship to smithereens. I couldn't help but wonder if we were just deluding ourselves, if our love was strong enough to overcome the obstacles that seemed to be piling up against us. I felt like I was losing myself in the process, like I was disappearing into the void of our problems. I longed for the carefree days when our love was new and exciting, when every moment together was a thrill. But those days seemed like a distant memory now, a fleeting dream that had vanished into thin air. I was left with the harsh reality of our situation, and the nagging fear that we might not make it through this after all."
"“Hi.” I’m trying not to stare at the ghost before me, but the hostess has pulled out the chair, and everyone is waiting for me to sit. To compensate, I sit too quickly as","she tries to push in the chair for me, and I end up four inches too far from the table. I adjust myself as she assures John that a waitress will be by shortly.",68,"the chair scrapes against the floor, and I feel a flush rise to my cheeks. The ghost, who I assume is my dinner companion, doesn't seem to notice my awkwardness. Instead, he smiles warmly and introduces himself as Max. I try to play it cool, but my mind is racing with questions. How did he die? Is he stuck here? Can he interact with the physical world? I push the thoughts aside and focus on the present, trying to make small talk as the hostess hands us our menus. Max orders for us, his voice low and smooth, and I find myself wondering what he sounds like when he's not, you know, dead. The conversation flows easily, and before I know it, we're laughing and joking like old friends. It's surreal, but I'm determined to make the most of this bizarre situation. As we wait for our food to arrive, I sneak glances at Max, trying to get a read on him. He's charming and charismatic, but there's something melancholy lurking beneath the surface. I'm intrigued, and I find myself wanting to know more about this ghost and his story."
"The waitress is suddenly there, and I’m agreeing to lemon in my water and being handed a menu that looks like a wedding invitation. John","already has what looks like a dirty martini, but it appears untouched. Condensation is beginning to form under the chill of what’s probably incredibly expensive vodka.",51,"is already studying his, his brow furrowed in concentration, and I can tell he's going to order something complicated, with modifications. I, on the other hand, am a simple girl with simple tastes, and I know exactly what I want. I close my menu and smile at the waitress, who is hovering expectantly. ""I'll have the grilled chicken, please,"" I say, and she nods, her pen poised over her notepad. John looks up, a hint of surprise on his face, and I can tell he's impressed that I've made up my mind so quickly. The waitress turns to him, and he launches into a lengthy explanation of his order, involving special requests and substitutions. I tune him out, taking a sip of my water and glancing around the restaurant. It's a nice place, with white tablecloths and soft music, and I feel a sense of relaxation wash over me. Maybe this won't be so bad after all."
"“So what is it, John?” I say after we’ve ordered strange-sounding appetizer salads and the",waitress has faded into the shadows. “Why did you stay away for most of his life?”,31,"waiter has left us alone again. John leans in, his eyes scanning the room as if he's worried someone might be listening. ""I've been getting these strange messages,"" he says, his voice barely above a whisper. ""At first, I thought it was just spam, but then I started to notice a pattern. They're always from different numbers, but the messages are always the same: 'They're watching you.'"" He pauses, studying me intently. ""I know it sounds crazy, but I have this feeling that something's off. And then I saw you on the news, and I knew I had to talk to you."" He glances around the room again, his eyes lingering on a group of people in the corner before returning to me. ""Can I trust you?"""
My laugh makes the tears spill but also stops more from forming. I touch my fingertips to my eyes for the sake of my,mascara and look back at John. The gentle concern on his face almost melts my resolve to continue to hold him to the fire.,48,"makeup, but the gesture is more of a nervous habit than a practical consideration. I've cried so much in the past few days that I'm starting to feel like I'm all out of tears, like my body has finally run dry. But the laughter is a welcome distraction, a brief respite from the overwhelming grief that's been suffocating me. I take a deep breath and let the humor wash over me, feeling it seep into my bones and warm my chest. It's a fragile, fleeting thing, but it's enough to give me the strength to keep going, to keep putting one foot in front of the other even when the road ahead seems impossible to navigate. I smile again, feeling the muscles in my face relax, and let the laughter carry me forward, one shaky step at a time."
“She was”—he takes another small sip from his glass and sets it back down on the tablecloth—“cold to him is I suppose the way to describe it. She went out of her way to word things so it was understood that she and Stella and I were the real,"family. And I did nothing, Autumn.” His gaze is firm as he admits it. “I should have done or said something, at least to him alone. But the marriage was already half-dead, and I was envisioning losing my second child by trying to reconnect with my first, and I—”",98,"family, and that he was just a guest, a visitor who had overstayed his welcome. He tried to brush it off, to tell himself that she was just being polite, but the words cut deep. He couldn't help but feel like an outsider, a stranger in his own home. He glanced over at Stella, who was watching him with a concerned expression, and forced a smile onto his face. ""It's fine,"" he said, trying to reassure her, but the tension in the air was palpable. He took another sip of his drink, feeling the cool liquid slide down his throat, and tried to change the subject. ""So, how was your day?"" he asked Stella, but his eyes kept drifting back to her, wondering what she was thinking, what she was feeling. The silence that followed was oppressive, heavy with unspoken words and unresolved emotions. He knew he needed to do something, to say something, but he was frozen, unsure of how to bridge the gap that had grown between them. The sound of the clock ticking on the wall seemed to grow louder, a reminder that time was passing, and he was running out of chances to make things right."
"The waitress appears with our salads. Mine is seaweed and shavings of cucumber, which looks like a pile of green spaghetti. John’s salad is red somehow. I find myself ordering both steak and lobster and wondering if the waitress will","faint if I ask for a doggy bag at the end of the meal. Before she leaves, she asks John if he would like another martini. He hesitates and says no but to ask again after the entrées have arrived.",80,"raise an eyebrow at the extravagance of my order, but she simply nods and heads off to put it in. I take a bite of my salad, the cool seaweed and cucumber a refreshing respite from the richness of the meal to come. John and I chat idly, discussing everything from our jobs to our families, the conversation flowing easily. As we wait for our main courses to arrive, I take a sip of my wine, feeling the stress of the day melt away. The restaurant is bustling, the sound of laughter and clinking glasses filling the air, but our table feels like a little oasis, a private world where nothing else matters. Before long, the waitress returns with our steaks and lobster, the aromas wafting up and making my stomach growl with anticipation. I take a bite of the steak, the tender meat practically melting in my mouth, and then try a piece of the lobster, the sweetness exploding on my tongue. It's a truly decadent meal, but I'm determined to savor every bite. As we eat, John and I continue to talk, our conversation turning to our plans for the future. We discuss our goals and aspirations, our dreams and fears, the conversation deepening and becoming more meaningful. The meal is a special treat, a celebration of our friendship and the joy of sharing a wonderful experience together."
"“I’m going to need those stories that you’re collecting,” I tell him. “And Jack’s been working to get",all sorts of pictures from people. Maybe we could put them together as a book for the baby.”,36,"the old computer up and running, so we can access the database and see if there are any connections between the cases. I also want to review the security footage from the night of the incident and interview the witnesses again. We need to piece together what happened and find out who's behind this. I have a feeling that time is running out, and we're the only ones who can stop whatever is coming next. Jack looks at me with a determined expression, and I know he's thinking the same thing. We're in this together, and we won't rest until we get to the bottom of it. I hand him a folder with the case files and he begins to scan through them, his eyes scanning the pages with a mixture of intensity and focus. I take a deep breath, preparing myself for the long night ahead, knowing that we're about to uncover secrets that some people would rather keep hidden."
"When the waitress comes with our entrées, John doesn’t order another martini. There isn’t space at",the table anyway with all the documents spread out. Together we build another inheritance for Phineas’s child.,33,"the small table for another drink, and besides, he’s already had two. He digs into his steak, and I follow suit with my pasta. The food is delicious, and for a while, we just eat and enjoy each other's company. The conversation is easy and light, and I find myself laughing at John's jokes and stories. As we finish our meals, the waitress comes back to clear the table and asks if we want dessert. John looks at me, and I shake my head, feeling full. He orders a coffee, and I ask for tea. As we wait for our drinks, the atmosphere in the restaurant starts to change. The lights dim slightly, and the music becomes softer and more romantic. I glance around, noticing the other couples in the restaurant, all of them lost in their own little worlds. John catches my eye, and I feel a flutter in my chest. I look away, trying to brush off the feeling, but I can sense his gaze on me. The waitress returns with our drinks, and John reaches out, his hand brushing against mine as he takes his cup. The touch sends a spark through me, and I pull my hand back, trying to play it cool. But I can feel the tension between us, and I know that this night is far from over."
"For the time being, I called John to let him know that the baby is a girl, and I told him about her heart. He babbled a bit","about being able to afford the best doctors, and I was surprised by my confidence when I told him that everything was probably going to be just fine.",56,"and seemed a bit taken aback, but I could sense the excitement in his voice. He asked me a million questions about her condition and what the doctors had said, and I tried to fill him in on as much as I could. I could tell he was trying to process everything, but he kept saying how happy he was that we were having a baby girl. I couldn't help but smile as I listened to him, feeling a mix of emotions myself. We talked for a while longer, and I could sense the weight of the news settling in for both of us. Eventually, we said our goodbyes, and I hung up the phone, feeling a sense of relief wash over me. I knew that we still had a long road ahead of us, but in that moment, I felt grateful to have John by my side. I took a deep breath, trying to calm my racing thoughts, and began to think about what the future held for our little family. I knew that we would face challenges, but I was determined to stay positive and focus on the joy that our baby girl would bring to our lives. As I sat there, lost in thought, I felt a sense of peace settle over me, and I knew that everything was going to be okay."
"It’s hard to explain why seeing Jack’s face will help, but it will, and I’m looking forward to telling him that the baby is a girl.","I’ll have to explain about the hole in her heart and how it’s probably going to be fine, probably, but I’m getting good at that, I think.",53,"As I walk into the hospital room, I can see the exhaustion etched on his face, but his eyes light up the moment he sees me. I take a deep breath, trying to contain my excitement, and make my way to his bedside. ""Hey, we got the results,"" I say, trying to sound casual, but my voice betrays me, trembling with anticipation. Jack's eyes lock onto mine, and I can see the question hanging in the air. I take another deep breath, savoring the moment, before blurting out the news. ""It's a girl, Jack. We're having a baby girl."" A wide smile spreads across his face, and he lets out a whoop of excitement, relief washing over him. I can see the tension melt away, replaced by a sense of joy and wonder. We sit there for a moment, grinning at each other, the weight of the past few months lifting off our shoulders. This little girl is already bringing us so much happiness, and she's not even here yet."
"I spoke to Jack on the phone yesterday, but I want to tell","him those things in person. Besides, the context of the call wasn’t right.",26,"him in person about the project details, so I'm planning to meet him at the office today. I've prepared all the necessary documents and I'm looking forward to discussing the proposal with him. Hopefully, we can finalize the plans and set a timeline for implementation. I'm a bit nervous but also excited to see this project take shape. I just hope everything goes smoothly and we can work together efficiently to achieve our goals."
"“Well, I had this umbrella of hers, and when I went to return it, something happened,” Jack said. “I think it’s going","to keep happening too. I know it’s a really weird situation, but I wanted you to know…in case it was a problem?”",44,"to sound a bit strange, but I could swear I saw her standing in the doorway, watching me. I know it sounds crazy, but I felt this chill run down my spine as our eyes met. I tried to brush it off as mere paranoia, but the feeling lingered. I approached her, umbrella in hand, and that's when I noticed something odd - she didn't seem surprised to see me. In fact, she looked almost... expectant. I handed her the umbrella, and as our fingers touched, I felt a jolt of electricity. It was as if time had slowed down, and all that existed was the two of us, suspended in that moment. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I felt a connection, a spark that I couldn't ignore. And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the moment was over. She took the umbrella, smiled, and turned to leave. I was left standing there, feeling bewildered and more than a little shaken. I couldn't shake the feeling that something had just shifted, that my life had been altered in some fundamental way. I didn't know what to make of it, but I knew I had to see her again, to try and understand what had just happened."
