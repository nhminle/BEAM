"Aside from Eager Beaver, there are fourteen of us starting today. Fourteen of us fresh out of top-five graduate programs, and prestigious internships, and CV-beefing industry","jobs accepted exclusively to look more attractive during NASA’s next round of recruitment. There’re fourteen of us, and the thirteen that aren’t me are all nodding enthusiastically.",53,"experience, all vying for a handful of spots in the company's coveted leadership development program. The competition is palpable, and I can sense the tension in the air as we all try to make a good impression on our first day. We're all dressed in our Sunday best, armed with freshly printed copies of our resumes and a rehearsed elevator pitch, ready to take on whatever challenges come our way. As we file into the conference room for our orientation, I take a moment to scan the room and size up my competition. There's the Harvard MBA with the chiseled jawline, the Stanford engineer with the impressive coding credentials, and the Wharton grad with the razor-sharp wit. I take a deep breath, mentally preparing myself for the long and grueling journey ahead, knowing that only a select few will emerge victorious. The presenter, a charismatic executive with a warm smile, welcomes us to the program and begins to outline the expectations and goals for the next few months. As he speaks, I feel a surge of adrenaline coursing through my veins, and I know that I'm ready to put in the hard work and dedication required to succeed in this cutthroat environment."
"The truth, though, is quite the opposite. I hated school at first sight—with the direct consequence that school hated the sullen, listless child that I was right back. In the first grade, I refused to learn how to write my name, even though Hannah is only three letters repeated twice. In junior high, I set a school record for the highest number of consecutive detention days—what happens when","you decide to take a stand and not do homework for any of your classes because they are too boring, too difficult, too useless, or all of the above. Until the end of my sophomore year, I couldn’t wait to graduate and leave all of school behind: the books, the teachers, the grades, the cliques. Everything. I didn’t really have a plan for after, except for leaving now behind.",137,"you're a teenager who's been labeled as ""difficult"" and has given up on trying to fit in. My parents were at their wit's end, and I was at mine. I felt like I was stuck in a never-ending cycle of boredom and rebellion, with no escape in sight. But then, something changed. I discovered a passion for writing, and suddenly, the world didn't seem so dull anymore. I started writing short stories and poetry, and for the first time in my life, I felt like I had found something that truly belonged to me. My grades began to improve, and I started to see a glimmer of hope that I might actually make it through high school without completely losing my mind. Of course, this newfound love of writing didn't exactly make me the most popular kid in school. In fact, it only seemed to further solidify my status as an outsider. But I didn't care. For the first time in my life, I felt like I was doing something that truly mattered, something that brought me joy and fulfillment. And that was all that mattered. As I look back on those tumultuous years, I realize that my struggles in school were not a reflection of my intelligence or my worth as a person. They were simply a reflection of my own unique struggles and challenges, and the fact that I was still trying to find my place in the world. And in the end, it was that struggle that ultimately led me to discover my true passion, and to find a sense of purpose and direction that I never thought possible."
"“It’s like space is your whole personality,” the girl I casually hooked up with during most of my sophomore year of undergrad told me. It was after I explained that no, thank you, I wasn’t interested in going out for coffee to meet her friends because of a lecture on","Kalpana Chawla I was planning to attend. “Do you have any other interests?” she asked. I threw her a quick “Nope,” waved good-bye, and wasn’t too surprised when, the following week, she didn’t reply to my offer to meet up. After all, I clearly couldn’t give her what she wanted.",100,"the societal implications of postmodern architecture that I had been looking forward to all week. She raised an eyebrow, clearly not understanding why I would prioritize a lecture over socializing, and that's when she made the comment about space being my whole personality. I didn't know how to respond, so I just shrugged and changed the subject. Looking back, I realize that her statement was more perceptive than I gave her credit for. My fascination with space and architecture wasn't just a quirk or a hobby – it was a fundamental aspect of who I was. I spent most of my free time reading about the history of urban planning, from the grand boulevards of Haussmann's Paris to the futuristic visions of Le Corbusier's Radiant City. I loved how a well-designed space could bring people together, foster a sense of community, and even shape the way we think and feel. As I delved deeper into my studies, I began to see the world as a complex web of interconnected spaces, each with its own unique character and rhythm. And I knew that I wanted to contribute to this world, to leave my mark on the built environment and make it a more beautiful, more functional, and more just place. But for now, I was content to simply observe and learn, soaking up the knowledge and inspiration that would one day help me create spaces that would inspire and uplift others."
"“Yeah, I’m not sure.” She shrugs and continues to make her way through a Tupperware of broccoli, an apple, and approximately two fucktons of Cheez-Its. “I don’t really know much about him. His parents divorced, then people in my family had arguments and stopped talking to each other. There was a lot of","prime Floyd dysfunction happening, so I haven’t actually spoken to him in years. But I heard from one of my other cousins that he was working on that thing that landed on Mars back when we were in high school. It was called something like . . .

I remember my mom saying something about his dad being a bit of a jerk, but that's about it. I've tried to ask my family members about it since, but nobody seems to want to talk about it. It's like this big, unspoken elephant in the room that everyone's just pretending doesn't exist. I've even tried to bring it up with my siblings, but they just shrug it off and change the subject. It's really frustrating, because I feel like I'm missing out on a big part of my family's history. I've always wondered what really happened, and why it's such a big deal. Maybe I'll try to do some digging and see if I can uncover some more information. I'm curious to know more about my family's past, and I'm not going to let a little thing like awkwardness stop me. I take another bite of my snack, lost in thought as I ponder the mysteries of my family's dynamics. The Cheez-Its are stale, but I don't even notice, too caught up in my own little world of speculation and curiosity. I glance over at my friend, who's watching me with a concerned expression. ""Hey, you okay?"" she asks, and I nod, snapping back to reality. ""Yeah, I'm fine. Just lost in thought, I guess."" She nods sympathetically and we sit in silence for a moment, munching on our snacks and enjoying the quiet companionship. "
"“I think so. Do the dates add up? Maybe it was some kind of summer internship? But honestly, it might just be Floyd family lore. I have an aunt who insists that we’re related to","the Finnish royals, and according to Wikipedia there are no Finnish royals. So.” She shrugs and pops another handful of Cheez-Its in her mouth. “Would you like me to ask around, though? For the assignment?”",70," Benjamin Franklin, but I've never been able to verify that claim. Anyway, I'm sure it's just a fun story that's been passed down through the years. I do know that my grandfather was a bit of a character, always telling tales of his adventures and the people he met along the way. He had a way of making you feel like you were right there with him, experiencing everything firsthand. I think that's one of the things I miss the most about him - the way he could spin a yarn and transport you to another time and place. Maybe that's where I get my love of history from, who knows? Anyway, I should probably get back to work on this project. I've got a lot of research to do and not a lot of time to waste. But it's nice to take a break and reminisce every now and then. It's funny how certain smells or sounds can bring back memories, isn't it? Like the smell of old books or the sound of a train whistle - it's like you're instantly transported back to a different time and place. I wonder if that's what it's like for people who have a strong sense of déjà vu - like they're experiencing something they've already lived through before. I've always been fascinated by that phenomenon, but I've never experienced it myself. Maybe one day I'll look into it further and see if I can learn more about it."
"“By the way, I sent you my cousin-or-something’s contact info a while ago,” Mara tells me one night. We’re at the",cheapest grad bar we’ve been able to find. She’s on her second Midori sour of the night. “Did you get it?”,42,"local diner, sipping on milkshakes and discussing our plans for the upcoming summer. I rack my brain, trying to recall the name of Mara's cousin, but it's on the tip of my tongue. ""Oh, you mean Alex?"" I ask, hoping I'm right. Mara nods, a mischievous grin spreading across her face. ""Yeah, that's the one. I told him all about you, and he's really interested in meeting you."" I raise an eyebrow, intrigued. ""What did you tell him?"" I ask, my curiosity piqued. Mara leans in, a conspiratorial look on her face. ""I told him you're the most adventurous person I know, and that you're always up for a challenge."" I laugh, feeling a thrill of excitement. ""And what makes you think he's interested in meeting me?"" I ask, my mind racing with possibilities. Mara just winks, and I know I'm in for a surprise."
"He frowns, as if momentarily blanking on Mara’s name. “Ah, yes.” He nods. Only once. “Apparently,” he adds, which makes me laugh. He waits for me to take a seat","across from him before folding back in his chair. I notice that he doesn’t hold out his hand, nor does he smile. Interesting. “Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.”",61,"before continuing, his eyes drifting to the small, leather-bound book lying open on the low table between us. The pages are yellowed and crackling with age, the text within written in a language I don't recognize. I run my fingers over the strange symbols, feeling a shiver run down my spine as he clears his throat, drawing my attention back to him. ""So, you're here about the... situation,"" he says, his voice low and measured, and I nod, my heart beginning to beat a little faster in anticipation. The air in the room seems to thicken, heavy with unspoken words and hidden meanings, and I lean forward, my eyes locked on his, as he begins to speak in a low, hypnotic tone, ""You see, it's not just a simple matter of..."""
"“Officially: unclear. But I’m fairly sure my brother made CDs of it. Sent them to local TV stations and whatnot.” He gestures vaguely, and his forearm is dusted with freckles and pale-red hair. I want to grab his wrist, hold it in front","of my eyes, study it at my leisure.

I've always been fascinated by the way the freckles on his skin seem to match the constellations in the night sky. It's as if the universe decided to leave its mark on him, to make him a part of something bigger than himself. I feel a pang of nostalgia wash over me as I think about the countless nights we spent lying on our backs in the backyard, gazing up at the stars and making wishes. My brother's eyes sparkle with a mischievous glint as he continues, ""I'm pretty sure I still have some of those CDs lying around somewhere. Want to take a look?"" He gets up and rummages through a nearby box, sending old VHS tapes and dusty DVDs tumbling to the floor. I watch as he searches, his movements economical and precise, a testament to the years he spent working as a librarian. Finally, he produces a CD with a triumphant flourish, blowing off the dust and examining it with a critical eye. ""Ah, yes. This is it. The infamous 'Lost Tape'."" He hands it to me, and I take it gingerly, feeling the weight of history in my hands. I turn it over, studying the crude label, the scribbled title and date. It's hard to believe that this small, unassuming disc holds the key to so many memories, so many secrets. I look up at my brother, and he's watching me with an expectant expression, as if waiting for me to unlock the mysteries of the past. I take a deep breath, and insert the CD into the player, the soft whir of the machine filling the silence between us."
"The section is in C++. Which happens to be the very first language I taught myself back in high school, when every single Google search for “Skills + Necessary + NASA” led to the sad result of “Programming.” Python came after. Then SQL. Then HAL/S. For each language, I started out convinced that chewing on","glass would surely be preferable. Then, at some point along the way, I began thinking in terms of functions, variables, conditional loops. A little after that, reading code became a bit like inspecting the label on the back of the conditioner bottle while showering: not particularly fun, but overall easy. I do have some talents, apparently.",111,"the bitter pill of learning a new syntax would be the hardest part. But it never was. It was the concepts, the logic, the problem-solving that came with it. I remember spending hours trying to wrap my head around object-oriented programming in C++. I would stare at the screen, trying to make sense of classes and objects, inheritance and polymorphism. But once it clicked, once I understood the underlying principles, the syntax became almost secondary. I could see the beauty in it, the way it all fit together like a puzzle. And that's when I knew I was hooked. I was no longer just learning a language, I was learning how to think, how to approach problems in a new way. And that's what I loved about it. The sense of accomplishment when I finally grasped a difficult concept, the thrill of creating something from scratch, the feeling of being part of a community that shared my passion. It was exhilarating, and it's what kept me going, even when the going got tough. And it's what drives me to this day, to continue learning, to continue pushing myself to be better, to create something truly remarkable."
"My heart rate picks up. Warmth twists in my lower stomach. I lean forward with a smile, feeling like I’m finally in my element. This, this, is what I know best. Depending on how busy I am with school, or work, or binge-watching K-dramas,","I do this about once a week. Which amounts to quite a bit of practice. “Maybe I could come to your place?” I say, finding the sweet spot between comically suggestive and Let’s get together to play Cards Against Humanity. “And you could show me?”",89,"I usually spend anywhere from a few hours to an entire day cooped up in this very café, typing away on my laptop or scribbling notes in my journal.

As I settle into my favorite corner table by the window, the barista greets me with a warm smile and a nod, knowing exactly what I'm here for. I take a deep breath, feeling the familiar rush of excitement as I dive into my latest project, the words flowing effortlessly onto the page as the world outside melts away. The sounds of the café become a gentle blur, a soothing background noise that fuels my imagination and sparks new ideas. Time stands still as I lose myself in the world of words, the only sound being the soft clinking of cups and the occasional burst of laughter from the other patrons. In this moment, everything feels right with the world, and I am exactly where I am meant to be."
"It sends me right over the edge. Into something that’s nothing like my usual, run-of-the-mill orgasm. Those tend to start like small fractures and then slowly, gradually deepen into something lovely and relaxing. Those are fun, good fun, but this . . . This pleasure is sudden and violent.

The world around me melts away, and all that's left is the sensation, the feeling, the overwhelming, all-consuming pleasure that threatens to consume me whole. And yet, even as I'm terrified of losing myself in this maelstrom, I know that I never want it to end."

My heart skips a beat as I realize it must be his, and I feel a flutter in my chest at the thought of him wanting to see me again. I look up, hoping to catch a glimpse of him, but he's already disappeared into the crowd. I'm left standing there, feeling a little dazed and wondering what just happened. I look down at the napkin again, feeling a sense of excitement and trepidation as I consider the possibility of calling him. Do I take a chance and reach out, or do I let the moment pass me by? The uncertainty is exhilarating, and I feel a sense of possibility that I haven't felt in a long time."

But there’s something about the way she looks at me, expectant and knowing, that makes me want to keep the details to myself. I shrug and change the subject, asking her about her day instead. She launches into a story about a project she’s working on, and I listen intently, trying to push the memory of her cousin’s words out of my mind. But they linger, echoing in my thoughts like a challenge. I find myself wondering what Mara would say if she knew the truth – if she knew that her cousin had all but accused me of being a fake, a pretender to the throne of their family’s affections. Would she believe me, or would she take his side? The uncertainty gnaws at me, making me feel like I’m walking on eggshells around her. I try to shake off the feeling, telling myself it’s ridiculous – I’m an adult, after all, and I don’t need anyone’s approval. But the doubt lingers, a constant hum in the background of my thoughts. As the days go by, I find myself withdrawing from Mara, pulling back from our usual easy camaraderie. I don’t know how to bridge the gap that’s growing between us, or how to reconcile the person I thought I was with the person her cousin seems to think I am. All I know is that I feel lost, and uncertain, and more than a little scared."

It was right before he","reminded me that I’d been the one to choose this. That I’d known what the risks of my mission were, and I still decided to undertake it.

I glance around the cramped interior of my habitat, the dim light from the solar-powered lantern casting eerie shadows on the walls. The silence is oppressive, punctuated only by the occasional crackle of the satphone as I wait for a response from AMASE. I take a deep breath, trying to focus on the task at hand, but my mind keeps wandering back to the avalanche warning. What if it's not just a warning? What if it's a prediction of something much worse? I push the thought aside, trying to concentrate on the present moment. I need to conserve my energy and wait for help to arrive. But as the hours tick by, I start to feel a growing sense of unease. Where is everyone? Why haven't they responded to my calls for help?

I stared blankly at my aunt, trying to process the revelation that my cousin, whom I had grown up with, was now apparently named Mara. I racked my brain, but all I could remember was her being called something else - Emily, or was it Elizabeth? The name Mara seemed completely foreign to me, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was missing something important. My aunt's voice cut through my thoughts, her tone laced with a mix of amusement and annoyance. ""Seriously, it's not that hard to remember,"" she said, chuckling. ""You're not getting any younger, you know."" I forced a laugh, trying to play it cool, but inside, I was still reeling from the shock."

But Mara's always been driven, and I have no doubt she'll excel in her new role. We make plans to catch up soon, maybe over coffee or dinner, and I hang up the phone feeling grateful for friends like her who make the distance feel a little less daunting."
"It is. AMASE is the shit, and the selection process to take part in an expedition was brutal, to the point that I’m not quite sure how I made it in. Probably sheer luck: Dr. Merel, one of the expedition leaders, was looking","for someone with experience in gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry.

The opportunity to be part of an expedition that could potentially make history was a dream come true. And now, as I sit here in the cramped quarters of our makeshift base camp, surrounded by the stark beauty of the Arctic landscape, I feel a sense of pride and wonder that I've never felt before. The AMASE expedition is more than just a research project - it's a journey into the unknown, a chance to explore the uncharted territories of our planet and uncover secrets that have been hidden for millions of years. And I'm honored to be a part of it. As I look around at my fellow team members, each with their own unique expertise and passion, I know that we're in this together - a diverse group of individuals united by a common goal: to push the boundaries of human knowledge and understanding. The days ahead will be tough, the challenges will be many, but I'm ready. Bring it on, I say. Bring on the adventure, the discovery, and the thrill of the unknown."

It was a wrong number, or so I thought, but the voice on the other end sent a shiver down my spine. Karl's concerned expression brings me back to reality, and I force a weak smile onto my face.

"As we all know, in early 2010, the rover Spirit became stuck in a sand trap, was unable to reorient its solar panels toward the sun, and froze to death as a consequence of its lack of power. Something very similar happened eight years later to Opportunity, which went into hibernation when a maelstrom blocked sunlight and prevented it from recharging its","batteries. Obviously, the risk of losing control of rovers because of extreme weather events is high. To address this, Dr. Arroyo has designed a promising internal system that is less likely to fail in the case of unpredictable meteorological situations. She proposes to build a model and test its efficacy on the next expedition at the Arctic Mars Analog in Svalbard (AMASE)—",124,"batteries. Although the mission team made numerous attempts to revive Opportunity, it was ultimately declared lost in February 2019. The loss of these two rovers highlights the challenges and risks associated with space exploration, particularly when it comes to the harsh Martian environment. Despite these setbacks, NASA has continued to push the boundaries of space exploration, with the Curiosity rover, launched in 2011, still actively exploring the Martian surface. The Perseverance rover, launched in July 2020, has also joined the ranks of Martian explorers, with a focus on searching for signs of past or present life on the Red Planet. The experiences and lessons learned from Spirit and Opportunity have undoubtedly contributed to the design and operation of these newer rovers, enabling them to navigate the unforgiving Martian terrain with greater success. As we look to the future of space exploration, it is essential to acknowledge the pioneering achievements of Spirit and Opportunity, which paved the way for the continued exploration of our celestial neighbor."
"Dr. Arroyo’s project is a brilliant addition to NASA’s current roster, and it should be approved for further","study. Dr. Arroyo’s vitae is impressive, and she has accumulated enough experience to carry out the proposed work—",36,"development and implementation. The potential breakthroughs that could arise from this research are substantial, and the scientific community would greatly benefit from the findings. By investing in Dr. Arroyo's project, NASA would be taking a significant step forward in advancing our understanding of the universe and its many mysteries. Furthermore, the project's innovative approach and cutting-edge technology make it an exciting opportunity for collaboration and knowledge-sharing among experts in the field. With the right support and resources, Dr. Arroyo's project has the potential to make a lasting impact on the world of space exploration and beyond."
"I met Dr. Merel because he was my direct superior during AMASE, and he is . . . an odd duck, honestly. Very stiff. Very hard-core. NASA is full of ambitious people, but he seems to be almost obsessed with results, publications, the kind of sexy science that makes","big splashy news. Initially I wasn’t a fan, but I must admit that as a supervisor he’s been nothing but supportive. He’s the one who selected me for the expedition to begin with, and he encouraged me to apply for funding once I went to him with my project idea.",99,"headlines and gets you noticed. I remember one time, we were in the field, and he was pushing us to collect more samples, even though we were all exhausted. I think he's a brilliant scientist, but sometimes I wonder if he forgets that there are human beings involved in the process. Despite his tough exterior, I've seen glimpses of a dry sense of humor, and I've tried to get him to open up a bit more. It's not always easy, but I think it's worth it. He's the kind of person who can make a real difference in the field, and I feel lucky to have had the chance to learn from him. As I reflect on my time at AMASE, I realize that Dr. Merel's intensity was a big part of what drove me to push myself to be better. He has a way of making you want to prove yourself, to show him that you're capable of producing high-quality work. It's a valuable skill, and one that I'll carry with me for the rest of my career. I just hope that someday he'll learn to balance his drive for results with a little more compassion for the people around him. The scientific community needs more people like Dr. Merel, but it also needs people who can work well with others and prioritize their well-being. I'm not sure if he'll ever be that person, but I'm grateful for the experience of working with him nonetheless."

In the meantime, I'll get the paperwork started and we can finalize the details with the investors. Let's schedule a meeting for tomorrow to go over everything and make sure we're all on the same page. I'm confident that with a bit of creativity and some hard work, we can still make this project a success."
"“I’ll be there, out in the field with you, of course,” Dr. Merel says. I’m a little surprised. In the months we were in Norway, I saw him do very little sample","collecting and snow plodding. I’ve always thought of him as more of a coordinator. But if he offered, he must mean it, and . . . I smile. “Perfect, then. Thank you.”",64,"collection himself, and I had assumed he would be more of a behind-the-scenes leader for this expedition. But I suppose that's not his style. He's a hands-on kind of guy, always eager to get his hands dirty and experience things firsthand. I admire that about him, even if it does make me a bit nervous at times. As we make our way to the field site, I can feel the excitement building up inside me. This is it, the moment we've all been waiting for. We're finally going to uncover the secrets that have been hidden beneath the ice for thousands of years. The air is crisp and cold, and I can see my breath as I exhale. Dr. Merel hands me a pair of gloves and a pickaxe, and I take them gratefully. We begin to dig, the sound of our tools striking the ice echoing through the stillness. It's hard work, but I'm determined to see it through. I glance over at Dr. Merel, who's working tirelessly beside me. He catches my eye and gives me a nod of encouragement. We're in this together, and I know we'll get the job done. As the hours pass, the sun beats down on us, and I start to feel the strain in my back and arms. But I refuse to give up. We're making progress, slowly but surely, and I can feel the anticipation building up inside me. What will we find? Will it be something incredible, something that will change the course of history? Or will it be something more mundane, a disappointment after all the hype? I push the thoughts aside and focus on the task at hand. We'll just have to wait and see. The ice is hard and unforgiving, but I'm determined to uncover its secrets. I take a deep breath and continue digging, the sound of my pickaxe striking the ice echoing through the stillness."
"The problems start when he looks up and notices me. He stops exactly two steps below, which should put him at a disadvantage but, depressingly, unfairly, tragically, doesn’t. We are at eye level when his","eyes widen and his lips curve in a pleased smile. He says, “Hannah,” a touch of something in his voice that I recognize but instantly reject, and I have no choice but to acknowledge him.",70,"eyes meet mine, and I feel a jolt of electricity run through my body. It's as if time has slowed down, and all that exists is the two of us, locked in this intense stare. I try to look away, but my gaze is transfixed on his, unable to break free from the hold he has on me. His eyes seem to bore into my soul, as if searching for something, and I feel a shiver run down my spine. The air around us is charged with tension, and I can sense the weight of unspoken words hanging between us. He takes a step closer, his eyes never leaving mine, and I feel my heart racing in anticipation of what's to come. The world around us melts away, and all that's left is the two of us, suspended in this moment of raw emotion. I can feel the heat emanating from his body, and my skin prickles with goosebumps as he takes another step closer, his face inches from mine. The silence between us is deafening, and I'm not sure what's going to happen next, but I know that nothing will ever be the same again."
"He doesn’t deny it, doesn’t defend himself, doesn’t scream that I’m insane. His","eyes narrow to blue slits and he asks, “It was Merel, wasn’t it?”",26,"eyes lock onto mine, a deep sadness and understanding reflected in them, as if he's been waiting for this moment, for me to finally see the truth that he's been hiding for so long. The air is thick with tension, heavy with the weight of unspoken words, and I can feel the silence between us like a living, breathing thing. He takes a step closer, his movements slow and deliberate, and I can sense the effort he's making to remain calm, to not let his emotions get the better of him. I'm frozen in place, my heart pounding in my chest, as I wait for him to speak, to say something, anything, to break the silence that's suffocating me."
"“Because he was there when I explained my objections, at length and in detail. Did he omit that?” I press my lips together. Which he seems to interpret as an opening. “Hannah.” He leans closer. We’re nose to nose, I smell his skin and his aftershave, and I hate every second of this. “Your","project is too dangerous. It specifically asks that you travel to a remote location to drop off equipment at a time of the year in which the weather is volatile and often totally unpredictable. I’ve been in Longyearbyen in February, and avalanches develop out of the blue. It’s only gotten worse in the last few—”",109,"objections are duly noted, but I'm afraid they're irrelevant at this point. The decision has been made, and it's final. I can see the frustration in your eyes, but I implore you to understand the bigger picture here. This is not just about you or me; it's about the entire team, the project, and the company's future. I know you're passionate about this, and I respect that, but sometimes passion has to take a backseat to pragmatism. Can't you see that this is the best decision for everyone involved? I'm not asking you to agree with me, but I am asking you to trust me on this one. I've been in this industry long enough to know what I'm doing, and I assure you, this is the right call. Let's work together to make this transition as smooth as possible, shall we?"" His words are laced with a condescending tone, and I can feel my anger simmering just below the surface. I take a deep breath, trying to compose myself, but my mind is racing with all the things I want to say to him. I want to tell him that he's wrong, that he's not listening, that he's not considering the consequences of his actions. But I know that would be futile. He's made up his mind, and nothing I say will change it. So I do the only thing I can think of – I nod, a small, tight movement of my head, and turn to leave. I need to get out of there before I say something I'll regret."
"I cling to him. He lets me sob for long moments we cannot afford, pressing me against him with no air between us, until I can feel his heartbeat through the thick layers","of our clothes. Then he mumbles “Fucking Merel” with barely restrained fury, and I think that it would be so easy to blame things on Merel, but the truth is, it’s all my fault.",67,"of his coat and the chill of the night air begins to seep into my bones. His grip on me tightens, a gentle reassurance that he's here, that he's not going anywhere, and I cling to that feeling, to him, like a lifeline. The world around us is a blur, the sounds of the city muffled and distant, as I let the warmth of his body seep into mine, trying to chase away the chill that's settled deep within me. His chest rises and falls with each breath, a steady rhythm that's both calming and comforting, and I find myself matching my breathing to his, feeling my own heartbeat slow to match the steady beat of his. The tears eventually subside, leaving behind a dull ache and a sense of emptiness, but with his arms around me, I feel a glimmer of hope, a sense that maybe, just maybe, we'll get through this together."
"“Who is M— Oh. Yeah. For the most part. Mom isn’t very fond of the Floyd side of the family. Though I’m sure he’s the black sheep by their standards, too.","I wasn’t really allowed to spend time with him, so . . .” He shakes his head, as if to change the topic. “Here. It’s not much, but you should eat.”",62,"She's always saying how they're a bit too... eccentric for her taste. I think that's part of why she and my dad got divorced, to be honest. He's always been a bit of a free spirit, and I think she just couldn't handle it anymore. But anyway, M— is my dad's brother, and he's... well, he's a piece of work. Always has been. I love him, but he's just one of those people who can't seem to get his life together. He's always getting into trouble, whether it's with the law or with women or with his own family. I swear, every time I see him, he's got some new drama going on. But despite all that, he's got a good heart, and I know he means well. He's just... misguided, I guess. And my mom, she's just worried that I'll turn out like him, I think. But I'm not like that. I'm responsible, I've got my head on straight. I'm not going to end up like M—, no matter how much my mom might worry about it."
"“No, no, shh.” His arms tighten around me, and I realize that I am, in","fact, crying. “You are not an asshole, Hannah. And you are the opposite of incompetent.”",30,"fact, crying. The sobs are racking my body, and I feel a wave of embarrassment wash over me. I try to pull away, but he holds me firm, his chest a solid wall of comfort. ""It's okay,"" he whispers, his breath warm against my ear. ""Just let it out."" I take a deep breath and let the tears flow, feeling a weight lift off my shoulders as I release all the pent-up emotions. His arms hold me close, a safe haven in the midst of the storm, and I feel my body begin to relax, my sobs slowly subsiding into sniffles. As I calm down, I become aware of the warmth of his body, the beat of his heart against mine, and the gentle way he's stroking my hair. It's a comforting sensation, one that makes me feel seen and heard in a way I haven't experienced in a long time."
"“Because of the intrinsic danger of a project like yours. For the past few months, I tried to get this project stopped in about ten different ways. Personal meetings, emails, appeals—I","tried it all. And even the people who agreed with me that it was too dangerous would not step in to prevent it. So no, you’re not the asshole, Hannah. They are.”",63,"even went so far as to contact a few of the investors, hoping to persuade them to pull their funding. But every door I tried led to a dead end. It seems that your project has a lot of powerful people backing it, and they're not willing to listen to reason. I'm starting to think that the only way to stop this project is to take a more... drastic approach. I've been doing some digging, and I think I've found a way to expose the truth about what's really going on here. But I need your help to make it happen. Are you with me?"
"“Oh.” I swallow. “Merel was supposed to come for backup. But he wasn’t feeling well. I offered to wait for him, but he said we’d be losing valuable days of data and that I should just go","alone, and I . . .” I squeeze my fingers around the material of Ian’s shirt. “I went. And then, when I called in for help, he told me that the weather was turning, and . . .”",75,"ahead without him. I didn't think much of it at the time, but now I'm starting to wonder if something was off. I mean, Merel's always been a bit of a worrier, but he's also a professional. If he said I should go on without him, I trusted his judgment. Still, a nagging voice in the back of my mind keeps telling me that I should have waited. That I should have insisted on waiting for him, no matter how much time it would have cost us. I push the thought aside and focus on the task at hand. I've got to get this data collected and get back to the lab before it's too late. I take a deep breath, mentally preparing myself for the long day ahead, and begin to make my way through the dense underbrush. The trees seem to close in around me, casting deep shadows that make it difficult to see. I fumble in my backpack for my flashlight and turn it on, the beam of light cutting through the darkness. As I walk, the silence is oppressive, punctuated only by the sound of my own breathing and the rustle of leaves beneath my feet. I've been walking for what feels like hours, but I know it's only been a few minutes. My heart is racing, and I can feel a sense of unease growing in the pit of my stomach. Suddenly, I hear a faint rustling in the bushes ahead. I freeze, my heart pounding in my chest. What was that? I strain my ears, listening intently, but there's only silence. I take a tentative step forward, my eyes scanning the darkness. And then, I see it. A figure, standing just beyond the reach of my flashlight's beam. My heart skips a beat as I realize that I'm not alone in the woods."
"He shrugs. “I figured you might want to talk through your near-death experience with someone, so",I decided to tell Mara what happened. I did not expect her to come in person.”,32,"I'm here to listen,"" he says, his voice low and soothing, as he leans back in his chair and steeples his fingers together, his eyes fixed intently on yours, waiting for you to begin. The dim lighting in the room seems to grow even more subdued, as if the shadows themselves are leaning in to hear your story, and for a moment, you feel a sense of trepidation, unsure of where to start or how to put into words the jumbled emotions and thoughts that have been swirling inside you since the accident. But as you look into his calm, non-judgmental face, you start to feel a sense of comfort, a sense of trust, and the words begin to flow, slowly at first, but then more easily, as you recount the events leading up to the crash, and the moments that followed, the memories still hazy and fragmented, but slowly taking shape as you speak."
"“I was going to. Once I felt less whiny. And—whatever.” I roll my eyes. Wow,",I’m mature. “How did you go from not remembering Mara’s name to having her number?”,30,"my drama level is off the charts today. I take a deep breath and try to shake off the lingering frustration. It's not like I'm going to let a little setback like this ruin my entire day. I've got better things to do than dwell on it. Like, I don't know, actually doing my job. I glance around the room, taking in the familiar sights and sounds of the office. It's a typical Monday morning, with the usual chatter and clinking of coffee cups. I spot my coworker, Rachel, typing away on her computer, and I make a mental note to catch up with her later. Maybe we can grab lunch together and I can vent about my morning. I take another deep breath, feeling a sense of determination wash over me. Time to put on my big girl pants and tackle the day head-on."
"“Well, still.” She shrugs. “I promise I don’t have anything against",you personally. I’m just not generally a fan of the Floyd family.”,23,"you, but I do have to admit that I'm a bit curious about what you're doing here. You're not exactly the type of person I'd expect to find in a place like this. What brings you to our little town?"
"“Yes,” Mara agrees. “Are you going to break my blood relative’s heart?","Don’t get me wrong, I’d still side with you. Hos before bros.”",24,"She looks at him with a serious expression, her eyes narrowing slightly as she awaits his response, the air thick with anticipation and unspoken emotions."
"“I guess we’ll see. I’m not sure he would want to date,” I say, staring at Sadie’s Froot Loops. The ensuing silence drags on so long,",I’m forced to look up. She and Mara are staring at me like I just announced that I’m quitting my job to take up macramé full-time. “What?”,53,"that I start to wonder if Sadie has dozed off with her eyes open, a talent she's mastered over the years. But then she blinks, and her gaze snaps back into focus. ""You're really not going to try to convince him, are you?"" she asks, her voice laced with a mix of amusement and curiosity. I shake my head, and Sadie lets out a low whistle. ""Well, I'll be. You're actually going to let him make his own decisions for once."" She pauses, studying me intently. ""You know, this might just be the start of something beautiful."" I raise an eyebrow, skeptical, but Sadie just grins mischievously. ""Mark my words, this is going to be interesting."""
"“Considering that he saved your life, contacted Great-Aunt Delphina, and put up two dudes he’s never seen",before so their girlfriends could hang out with you . . . I think maybe he does.”,34,"before in his home, I think it's safe to say that he's earned the right to be a bit nosy. Besides, he's been acting strange ever since he got back from that trip to the city. Always sneaking off to take phone calls and getting these mysterious messages that he immediately deletes. I'm starting to think he's involved in something big, something that could put all of us in danger. I've tried talking to him about it, but he just brushes it off, saying I'm being paranoid. But I know what I've seen, and I know that look in his eye. It's the same look he had when he used to sneak out of the house at night to meet up with his friends. I'm telling you, something is going on, and I aim to find out what it is."
"“Actually, they fixed the elevator. And this new cast is easy to walk on. So, no need. But you . . .” You can","do this, Hannah. Come on. You just survived polar bears thanks to this guy. You can say the words. “You could come up anyway.”",48,"can see the concern in her eyes, and I know she's not just talking about the physical challenges of navigating the stairs. There's something else on her mind, something she's hesitant to bring up. I take a deep breath, preparing myself for what's to come, and ask her to continue. ""But I what?"" I prompt, trying to sound nonchalant despite the growing sense of unease in my chest. She glances around the room, as if searching for an escape route or a distraction, before her gaze settles back on me. ""You're not going to like it,"" she warns, her voice barely above a whisper. I feel a shiver run down my spine as I realize that whatever she's about to say, it's going to change everything."
"“Right.” He sighs and bites into his lower lip. “Hannah, if that changes. If you ever find yourself able to believe that someone could care about you that much. And","if you wanted to actually . . . have dinner with that someone.” He lets out a laugh. “Well . . . Please, consider me. You know where to find me.”",61,"you're willing to take a chance on it, I want you to know that I'll be here, waiting for you. I'll be here, hoping that someday you'll see that I'm not just saying these things to make you feel better, but because I truly mean them. I care about you, Hannah, more than I've ever cared about anyone in my life. And I know that might be hard for you to accept, given everything you've been through, but I want you to know that I'm not going anywhere. I'll be here, patiently waiting, until you're ready to take a chance on me, on us, and on the possibility of a future together. I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to put in the work, to help you heal, to help you see that you are worthy of love and care. And when you're ready, I'll be here, with open arms, ready to catch you if you fall, and to hold you close when you need it most."
“Hannah.” He gives me a skeptical look. “You have two friends who,dropped everything to be with you. And I assume sex wasn’t involved.”,24,"are always by your side, and yet you're telling me you're lonely. That doesn't add up. What's going on, Hannah? You can tell me,"" he says, his voice softening as he takes a step closer to me, his eyes searching mine for answers. I look away, feeling a lump form in my throat as I try to process the mix of emotions swirling inside me. I've always been able to talk to him about anything, but this feels different. This feels like I'm exposing a part of myself that I've kept hidden, even from my closest friends."
"“Hannah.” He unbuckles his seat belt and angles himself toward me, so that I have no choice but to look him in the eyes. He looks earnest and nearly offended. “I have thought about what happened in my office every day for the past five years. You offered to go down on me, and I just . . . embarrassed myself, and it should be the most mortifying memory I have, but for some reason it’s turned into the axis every fantasy of mine spins around, and”—he reaches up to pinch the bridge of his nose—“I want to fuck you.","Obviously. Always have. I just don’t want to fuck you once. I want to do it a lot. For a long time. I want you to come to me for sex, but also want you to come to me when you need help with your taxes and moving your furniture. I want fucking to be only one of the million things I do for you, and I want to be—” He stops. Seems to collect himself and straightens, as if to give me space. To give us space. “I’m sorry. I don’t want to crowd you. You can . . .”",201,"His words hang in the air, and I feel my face heat up as I process what he's saying. I'm shocked, but at the same time, I'm not. I've thought about that moment too, more times than I care to admit. I've wondered what would have happened if he had taken me up on my offer, if we had given in to our desires.  I look at him, really look at him, and I see the sincerity in his eyes. He's not just saying this to get a rise out of me; he's being honest. And that honesty is both terrifying and exhilarating.  ""I want to fuck you,"" he repeats, his voice low and husky. ""I want to feel you beneath me, to taste your skin, to hear you moan my name. I want to make up for lost time, to explore every inch of your body.""  My heart is racing, and I can feel my pulse pounding in my neck. I'm not sure what to say, how to respond. Part of me wants to tell him to stop, to pretend like this conversation never happened. But another part of me, a bigger part, wants to give in, to see where this desire takes us.  I take a deep breath, trying to calm my racing thoughts. ""Why now?"" I ask, my voice barely above a whisper. ""Why after all these years?""  He looks at me, his eyes searching mine. ""Because I realized that I've been living in the past, reliving that moment over and over again. And I don't want to do that anymore. I want to create new memories, with you.""  His words are like a punch to the gut, leaving me breathless and wanting more. I feel like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff, staring into the unknown. And I'm not sure if I'm ready to take the leap."
"He laughs, low and beautiful and a little rueful. And after looking at me like no","one else ever has before, what he says is, “Yes, Hannah. It is a yes on dinner.”",33,"one has ever looked at me before, he turns and walks away, leaving me feeling like I've been punched in the chest. I stand there for a moment, trying to catch my breath, wondering what just happened. The sound of his laughter still echoes in my mind, and I feel a shiver run down my spine as I realize that I've never felt this way about anyone before. I'm not sure if it's excitement or fear, but I know that I want to feel it again. I take a deep breath and start to follow him, my heart pounding in my chest as I try to keep up with his long strides. As I walk, I notice the way the sunlight catches his hair, highlighting the subtle waves and texture, and I feel a pang of curiosity about this mysterious person who has suddenly turned my world upside down."
"“Um, I could make us a . . .” I scratch my head, studying the contents of my open fridge. Okay, so it’s full. The problem is, it’s full exclusively of stuff that needs to be cooked, chopped, baked, prepared. Stuff that’s healthy and doesn’t taste","particularly good. I am now 93 percent sure that Mara was the one who went shopping, because no one else would dare to impose broccoli on me. “How does one even . . . I could boil the broccoli, I guess? In a pot? With water?”",92,"like cardboard. I'm starting to think that's the real reason I never have anyone over. It's not that I'm a hermit, it's just that I have no idea how to make anything edible. I mean, I can barely make ramen noodles without setting off the fire alarm. I glance over at my guest, who's watching me with an expectant expression. I can almost see the thought bubble above her head: ""Is this guy for real?"" I take a deep breath and try to think of something, anything, that I can whip up without too much trouble. Ah, yes. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I can do that. I rummage through the cupboard, searching for the peanut butter. It's not like I'm a complete failure in the kitchen or anything. I mean, I've made some pretty decent PB&Js in my time. I just... need to work on the whole ""cooking actual food"" thing. I pull out the bread and start to assemble the sandwiches, trying to look confident. ""So, how's your day been?"" I ask, attempting to distract her from my culinary ineptness. She launches into a story about her job, and I listen intently, nodding along and making supportive noises. Maybe, just maybe, I can get through this without too much embarrassment. I hand her a sandwich and we sit down at the table, munching away in silence. It's not the most exciting meal, but at least it's edible. And hey, it's a start, right?"
“Hannah.” His forehead touches mine. He laughs against my mouth. “Dinner is . . . it’s symbolic. A,"metaphor. If you tell me that you’re willing to see where things go, I believe you, and we can—”",37,"representation of the life we're building together. It's a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there's always something to be grateful for. His words are laced with a deep emotion, and I can feel the sincerity in his voice. As we stand there, the tension between us is palpable, and I know that this moment is a turning point in our relationship. The air is charged with anticipation, and I can sense the weight of our unspoken feelings. His eyes lock onto mine, and I see the depth of his passion, his love, and his commitment. In this instant, I know that I am exactly where I am meant to be – in his arms, with his heart beating against mine."
"He is hot and huge. Closing his eyes, arching his neck before looking at me again with a half-warning, half-pleading expression. He finds me sitting","on his knees, his cock spasming in my grip as I lean over. “Hannah,” he says, even deeper than usual. “What are you . . .”",51,"on the edge of the bed, my legs tucked under me, and my eyes fixed on him. His chest heaves with each ragged breath, and I can see the tension in his muscles as he struggles to maintain control. The air is thick with unspoken words, and I can feel the weight of his gaze on me like a physical touch. He takes a step closer, his eyes never leaving mine, and I can see the conflict warring within him. His face is a map of contradictions - the sharp angles of his jaw and cheekbones softened by the gentle curve of his lips, the fierce glint in his eye tempered by the vulnerability that lurks beneath. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest as he raises a hand, his fingers brushing against my cheek in a touch that sends shivers down my spine. ""Don't,"" he whispers, his voice low and husky, ""don't look at me like that."" But I'm not sure what he means, or what he wants from me. All I know is that I'm trapped in the depths of his eyes, drowning in the turbulent emotions that swirl within them."
“Or maybe it’s the Vastitas Borealis.” He’s barely intelligible. Doing those little thrusts that are designed more to open me up than to,"fuck me properly, and yet we’re both this close to orgasm. It’s a little scary. “The oceans that used to fill it, Hannah.”",46,"actually bring us closer together. I try to focus on the sensation, but my mind keeps drifting back to the conversation we had earlier. The one where he mentioned the possibility of us being the last two people on earth. I push the thought away, not wanting to ruin the moment. But it's hard to shake off the feeling of desperation that's been lingering in the air. He's trying to distract me, to make me forget about the desolate landscape outside, but it's no use. The Vastitas Borealis, a vast and barren wasteland, stretches out before us like an endless grave. I feel a shiver run down my spine as he whispers something in my ear, his breath hot against my skin. I try to respond, but my voice catches in my throat. The only sound is the creaking of the old ship's hull, a reminder that we're not alone, that there's still something out there, waiting for us."
