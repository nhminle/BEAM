I [29m] have been friends with Chad [32m] since we were born. Our moms are best friends and we grew,"up together and were roommates for the last 10 years, up until the incident that set our current situation into motion.",41,"up together, sharing countless memories and experiences that have shaped our lives in profound ways. As we grew older, our friendship deepened, and we found ourselves drawn to each other in ways we never could have anticipated. We began to realize that our connection went far beyond a simple friendship, and we started to explore the possibility of something more. It wasn't until we were in our mid-twenties that we finally confessed our feelings to each other, and it was like a weight had been lifted off our shoulders. We knew that our relationship wouldn't be without its challenges, but we were determined to make it work, no matter what. Our moms, who had been like second mothers to each other, were overjoyed when they found out, and they couldn't wait to see us happy together. As we navigated the ups and downs of life, we knew that we could always count on each other, and that our love would only continue to grow stronger with time."
"Anyway, forward to five months ago. I dated Hope [28f] for a few weeks. Not a big deal. We decided we weren’t feeling it, no chemistry, so we called it quits. And then lo and behold she hits","it off with Chad. Of course in true Good Luck Charm fashion, this means Chad is her soulmate. Chad is all googly-eyed over her, they’ve met the parents, they’re ring shopping—and they want to move in together. Immediately.",76,"me up a month later and tells me she's pregnant. I'm shocked, to say the least. I ask her if she's sure it's mine, and she says yes, that I'm the only one she's been with in the past year. I'm still trying to wrap my head around this, but I try to do the right thing and offer to support her. We start making plans for the baby, and I'm thinking that maybe this is a chance for me to be a good dad and make a difference in this kid's life. But then things start to get weird. Hope starts making all these demands, like I need to pay for her to move into a bigger place and buy her a new car. And she's always texting me, wanting to know where I am and who I'm with. I start to feel like I'm being controlled, and I'm not sure if I'm ready for this kind of responsibility. I try to talk to her about it, but she just gets defensive and says I'm not taking this seriously enough. I'm starting to wonder if I've made a huge mistake."
"The only problem is that Chad has six more months on our lease but found a perfect new house for him and Hope, and he can’t afford to pay rent on two places at the same",time. So he had to make the difficult decision to screw me over or screw her over—and he picked me. Now I have to find a way to cover his rent until the lease is up.,72,"time. He's been trying to find someone to take over the lease, but so far, no one has been interested. I've been helping him post ads on social media and local classifieds, but it's been tough. We're starting to get worried that he'll be stuck paying double rent for the next six months. I've even considered taking over the lease myself, but I'm not sure if I can afford it. I've been trying to crunch the numbers, but it's just not feasible. I'm hoping that someone will come along soon and take the lease off our hands. In the meantime, Chad and Hope are getting anxious to move into their new place. They've already started packing and are eager to start this new chapter in their lives. I'm happy for them, but I'm also going to miss living with Chad. We've had some great times together, and it's going to be weird not having him around. I'm sure we'll still hang out and all, but it's just not the same as living together. I'm going to have to find a new roommate, which is always a hassle. I'm not looking forward to it, but I know it's part of life. I just hope that Chad can find someone to take over the lease soon, so we can all move on with our lives."
"I’m annoyed, but I decided to try to find a reason to spend more time outside so I don’t have to stare out my window. I’ve always wanted a dog, but Chad would never agree to it. So I went to a rescue and found the ugliest animal there. The one so hideous, nobody else wanted it. This dog’s got an underbite and mange, and he’s missing half an","ear. He’s a little Brussels Griffon, so he’s got that deep frown—he looks like a judgmental gremlin. I adopted him and named him Chad since the dog is now my new best friend. If you’re reading this, you’re dead to me, human Chad. (Not really, I still love the guy.) But I tag him in the captions of every Chad the Dog Instagram post with “Look, a loyal Chad!”",138,"of his fur. I named him Frank, and he's been my constant companion ever since. At first, Chad was furious when he found out I'd brought home a dog without consulting him, but Frank's charm quickly won him over. Now, Chad's the one who takes Frank on long walks and plays fetch with him in the park. I have to admit, it's been nice to see Chad's softer side. Frank's also been a great conversation starter, and I've met some interesting people while out walking him. There's Mrs. Johnson, who always brings Frank treats and tells me about her grandkids, and Jake, the guy who runs the hot dog cart on the corner, who always slips Frank a snack when he thinks I'm not looking. Having Frank around has made me realize how much I was missing out on by spending so much time indoors. I've started taking art classes again, and I've even sold a few pieces to some of the people I've met through Frank. It's funny how one ugly dog can bring so much beauty into your life. I'm grateful for Frank, and I know that I made the right decision in adopting him. He may not be the prettiest dog, but he's definitely the best thing that's happened to me in a long time."
I tilted my head so my braid fell to one side and held up four fingers. Maddy,"didn’t look happy, but she took the picture with my phone, then handed it back to me.",34,"immediately understood the signal and nodded, her eyes scanning the crowded room before she slipped out of the booth and made her way to the bar, expertly weaving past the throngs of people. I watched her go, a sense of anticipation building in my chest as I waited for her to return with the drinks. The music was getting louder, the beat pulsating through the air, and I felt my foot tapping along with the rhythm. Maddy reappeared a few minutes later, a tray balanced precariously in her hands, and slid back into the booth beside me. ""So, what's the plan?"" she asked, her voice raised above the din of the music, as she handed me a drink. I took a sip, feeling the cool liquid slide down my throat, and grinned at her. ""We're going to have some fun,"" I said, my eyes sparkling with mischief. Maddy raised an eyebrow, but a smile was already spreading across her face. She knew that look, and she knew that when I got that glint in my eye, things were about to get interesting."
"“That dog trusts him,” Maddy said. “And that’s a rescue dog, so that means something. They’re usually all","skittish and freaked out.” She went quiet again looking at his wall. “Go down further,” Maddy said. “The billboard.”",37,"skittish around new people, but that one seems to have taken a liking to him. I've seen it follow him around the house, even when he's not paying attention to it. It's really quite adorable. I think it's because he's so calm and gentle, even when he's working on those old machines in the garage. The dog seems to sense that he's not a threat, and it's amazing to see how quickly it's formed a bond with him. Maybe we can even start taking it on walks together, now that the weather's getting nicer. Wouldn't that be something?"
That night after work Maddy made dinner. Grilled portobello mushrooms and rice pilaf. I did,"the dishes and cleaned the kitchen, then took a shower and blew out my hair.",30,"the dishes while she sat on the couch, flipping through a magazine. The TV was on in the background, but neither of us was really paying attention to it. We'd had a long day and were both looking forward to unwinding. As I scrubbed the last of the pots, Maddy got up and began to clear the table, putting the leftover mushrooms in a container for lunch the next day. I dried my hands and joined her, and together we tidied up the kitchen, the comfortable silence between us a testament to our years together. After we finished, Maddy suggested we watch a movie, and I agreed, happy to spend a quiet evening at home with her."
"“Sorry, I had to give Brad his dewormer. I brought some for",you too. Faith said you’ve been dragging your ass on the carpet?”,24,"the other animals as well, just in case. I know it's not the most pleasant task, but it's necessary to keep them healthy. I've also brought some fresh water and food for them, and I was thinking we could set up a small enclosure to keep them safe and comfortable. Do you think that's a good idea?"
My best friend was in a Hawaiian shirt and pink cargo shorts. He was a general manager at Trader Joe’s. I missed not having to go to the grocery store now,"that he had moved out. Actually, I missed a lot of things now that Brad had moved out. Like having another human to talk to, even if it was this one.",62,"because my friend would often bring me back exotic cheeses and other gourmet goodies from his store. He had a great eye for unique products and was always eager to share his latest discoveries with me. As we walked along the beach, he told me about a new type of artisanal chocolate that had just arrived at the store, and I couldn't wait to try it. The smell of saltwater and coconut sunscreen filled the air as we strolled along, enjoying the warm sunshine and each other's company. It was moments like these that I cherished, away from the hustle and bustle of daily life, surrounded by the beauty of nature and the comfort of good friendship."
"“This is true,” Brad said, looking at his phone. “We are",assholes. But only to each other. It’s the foundation of our friendship.”,23,"currently running about 20 minutes behind schedule, and if we don't leave now, we'll miss the opening act. Come on, let's go,” he urged, already heading towards the door. His friends quickly followed, grabbing their jackets and bags as they rushed out of the apartment. As they walked to the venue, the excitement was palpable, and they couldn't wait to see their favorite band perform live. The night was young, and the music was calling."
"Brad nodded at me. “You know, if she’s got the same thing you do,","if you guys date each other, you’ll both find your soulmates when you break up.”",29,"she might be able to help us figure out what's going on. I mean, think about it - two people with the same... condition, or whatever it is, working together to uncover the truth. It's worth a shot, right? We could try to track her down, see if she's willing to talk. I've got some ideas on how to find her, but we'll need to be careful. If she's in hiding, there's a reason for it. What do you say? You up for a road trip?"
They were starting to do the couples thing for all the trips and birthdays. They were all going up,"to Lutsen in October to go hiking. They asked me if I wanted to go, but I didn’t. Not alone.",39,"to the mountains for a weekend getaway, and it was becoming a tradition that everyone looked forward to. The group dynamic was always lively, with plenty of laughter and inside jokes that only came from years of shared experiences. As they wound their way up the mountain roads, the scenery shifted from bustling towns to dense forests and finally, the serene landscape of their favorite resort. The group had been friends since college, and over the years, they had been through thick and thin together, celebrating each other's successes and supporting each other through life's challenges. This trip was no exception, with several milestones to mark, including a birthday and a recent engagement. The excitement was palpable as they pulled up to the resort, eager to spend a few days relaxing, reconnecting, and making new memories together."
Brad took a swallow of his drink. “Ask that nurse out. Go,"wherever she is. Pitch the idea to her, she might be into it.”",25,"on a date with her. You never know what might happen. She seems nice and you two have a good connection. Don't let this opportunity slip away. Besides, it's been a while since you've been on a date, and it's time to get back out there. You've been focusing on work for too long, and it's not healthy. Take a chance, be spontaneous, and see where things go. The worst that could happen is that she says no, but at least you'll know you tried. So, what do you say? Are you going to ask her out or not?"
"“Yeah,” Brad said. “She dates you, you guys break up, and she rides happily into the sunset too. It’s a win-win. Seriously. This is your chance.",If you don’t do something you’re gonna spend the rest of your life sending women on to their forever families and never getting one for you.”,52,"to get back at her and make her realize what she's been missing. I mean, think about it, you're the only guy who's ever been able to make her feel this way, and she's just going to walk away without a second thought? It's not like she's going to find someone better than you, because let's be real, you're the best thing that's ever happened to her. So, here's what you're going to do. You're going to ask her out, and you're going to make it a night to remember. You're going to wine her, dine her, and make her feel like the queen that she is. And then, you're going to break up with her, and watch as she realizes too late that she's made a huge mistake. It's the perfect plan, and it's going to be glorious."
Brad looked me in the eye. “You will never find someone as long as all the women you date aren’t actually meant for you. You’re not their,soulmate. Their soulmate is the person they meet after you. It’s decided the minute it starts. They are literally fated not to be The One. Think about it.”,55,"type, and they're not yours either. You're just two people who are passing through each other's lives, never truly connecting. You need to find someone who is your match, someone who understands you, and you them. Until then, you'll just be stuck in this cycle of unfulfilling relationships."" His words struck a chord within me, and I couldn't help but wonder if he was right. Was I just settling for people who weren't truly meant for me? The thought sent a shiver down my spine as I realized that I had been doing just that. I had been so focused on finding someone, anyone, that I hadn't stopped to think about what I truly wanted. Brad's words had given me a lot to think about, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude towards him for being honest with me. As I sat there, lost in thought, Brad got up and walked away, leaving me to ponder my love life and the choices I had made. I watched him go, feeling a sense of uncertainty about my future, but also a sense of hope that I hadn't felt in a long time."
"I had actually thought about her. I’d checked once or twice to see if she’d messaged me again. She hadn’t. The last message was me telling her it was nice chatting with her, three days ago. Trying to keep talking to her was a dead end if she","lived somewhere else. But I don’t know. Maybe Brad had a point. What could it hurt to try? Worst-case scenario, I’d spend some time and money and have no connection with her. What was new? I was already doing that with every date that didn’t pan out anyway.",96,"wasn't going to respond. I had better things to do than wait around for someone who clearly wasn't interested. I pushed the thought aside and focused on my work, trying to distract myself from the nagging feeling that I'd missed an opportunity. As the day went on, I found myself glancing at my phone more and more, hoping against hope that she'd finally sent a message. But every time, my inbox was empty. I sighed and rubbed my temples, trying to shake off the frustration. Why was I so invested in this? It was just a conversation, after all. But there was something about her that had piqued my interest, something that made me want to know more. I made a mental note to forget about her and move on, but my mind kept wandering back to our conversation. What had she been like in person? Was she funny, or serious? Did she have any hobbies or passions? The questions swirled in my head, refusing to be silenced. I knew I needed to let it go, but a part of me held on, hoping that someday I'd get the chance to find out more about this mysterious person."
I already knew what he did for a living because Maddy had cyberstalked,"him. Of course I couldn’t tell him that, so I had to ask questions.",27,"him on social media and told me all about his job as a freelance graphic designer, but I had never met him in person before, so I was a bit nervous about how our conversation would go, especially since Maddy had warned me that he could be a bit awkward at times, but as soon as he smiled and introduced himself, I felt at ease and we quickly discovered a shared love for art and music that helped to break the ice and get our conversation flowing smoothly."
Me: Not sure yet. I live with my best friend Maddy and we alternate who chooses,"where we’ll go next. She picked Hawaii, and I haven’t decided where to go after that.",32,"the restaurant every week. We've been doing this for years, and it's become a fun little tradition for us. Last week was my turn, and I chose a new Italian place downtown that I'd been wanting to try. The pasta was amazing, and we ended up staying for hours chatting and laughing. This week is Maddy's turn, and I have no idea where she's going to take me. She's been dropping hints all week, saying it's going to be a surprise, but I'm not getting my hopes up. We'll see what happens. Maybe it'll be somewhere new and exciting, or maybe it'll be our usual spot. Either way, I'm just looking forward to spending time with my best friend and catching up on each other's lives."
"For a moment I debated calling from a blocked number. He was nice, but I still didn’t know him. But I figured it",was just as easy to block him later if he got creepy. I dialed and he picked up on the first ring. “Emma.”,46,"would be better to be upfront and honest about who I was, so I dialed his number and waited for him to pick up. As the phone rang, I couldn't help but think about how this conversation could go either way. He might be understanding and willing to help, or he might be annoyed that I was bothering him again. I took a deep breath and prepared myself for either outcome. When he finally answered, I launched into my explanation, trying to be as clear and concise as possible. To my relief, he listened attentively, asking a few questions to clarify the situation. As we talked, I found myself feeling more and more at ease, and by the time we hung up, I was feeling hopeful that things might just work out after all."
“But what if it isn’t? I’m just playing devil’s advocate here. What if it isn’t? Brad said that everyone I’m serious enough to date more than twice is cosmically destined for someone else.” He went quiet for,"a beat. “Does nobody feel right to you? Like, there’s just enough there to give it a little go, but then the bottom falls out? Is that just me? Or is it like that for you also?”",74,"a moment, collecting his thoughts before speaking again. ""I mean, think about it. If the universe has already decided who we're meant to be with, then what's the point of even trying? It's like, are we just pawns in some grand game of cosmic matchmaking? I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. If Brad's theory is true, then that means every person we date who isn't 'the one' is just a distraction, a detour on the way to our true destiny. And what about the people who never find 'the one'? Are they just doomed to be alone forever? It's a pretty bleak outlook, if you ask me. But at the same time, it's kind of... comforting? I mean, if the universe has a plan, then that means we don't have to worry so much about making the wrong choices. We can just trust that everything will work out in the end. But then again, that's a pretty passive way to live, isn't it? I don't know, maybe I'm just overthinking this whole thing. What do you think?"""
"“Look,” he said. “I know the idea’s a little out there. But if this is actually a thing, we’re in a pretty low-risk/high-reward situation. We’d just have to hang out a few times and","then stop. That’s it. If what Brad said is true and we can’t find our person because everyone we’re interested in is meant for someone else, I would actually really like it if it stopped.”",69,"see if anything develops. I mean, what's the worst that could happen? We spend a few hours together and nothing comes of it? That's not exactly a huge loss. But if it does work... well, think about it. We could be looking at a whole new level of understanding about the human brain. And who knows, maybe even a new way to tap into its potential. I'm not saying it's going to change the world or anything, but it's definitely worth a shot. Plus, I have to admit, I'm a little curious. What if this is real? What if we're actually onto something here? I know it sounds crazy, but I think it's worth exploring. So, what do you say? Are you in?"
"I nodded and put up a finger. “I’ve got to go,”",I said into the phone. “Maddy wants to watch a movie.”,22,"and with that, I swiftly turned around and walked away, leaving the conversation hanging in the air, the sound of my footsteps echoing through the silence that followed."
"Maddy looked annoyed. “Probably didn’t pay the bill. You know, for someone who asks you for as","much money as she does, she sure ends up in collections a lot. God, I hate her.”",34,"much as he does, you'd think he'd be more considerate of other people's time and money. I mean, seriously, how hard is it to pay a bill on time? It's not like he's some kind of struggling artist, he's got a good job and a steady income. And yet, every time we go out, he's always 'forgetting' his wallet or 'waiting for his paycheck'. I swear, it's like he thinks the rest of us are made of money. And the worst part is, he never even apologizes or offers to make it up to us. He just acts like it's no big deal, like we're all just one big happy family who can absorb his financial irresponsibility. Newsflash, buddy: we're not your personal bank. You need to start taking responsibility for your own finances, and stop relying on the rest of us to bail you out all the time."
I looked away from her. My relationship with my mother was complicated. It,"wasn’t complicated for Maddy though, she knew exactly how she felt about it.",26,"had been strained for years, ever since my father's passing, and I often found myself struggling to connect with her on even the most basic levels. The tension between us was palpable, and I could feel it hanging in the air like a thick fog, making it hard to breathe. I knew I needed to try and bridge the gap, but every time I attempted to reach out, I felt like I was hitting a brick wall. My mother's expression, a mix of sadness and frustration, only made things worse, and I couldn't help but wonder if we would ever be able to find our way back to each other."
"I’d stopped calling jails and hospitals years ago when this kind of thing happened. Filing a missing person’s report was a waste of time. Amber moved too fast, was too impulsive. She’d go to",a concert and climb onto a tour bus and end up across the US. Or she’d meet a guy at a bar and get invited to live on his boat for four months in Florida.,69,"some party, meet some guy, and be back home within a week, always with some wild story to tell and a new tattoo to show off. But this time, something felt different. Maybe it was the fact that she'd been gone for three weeks already, or maybe it was the cryptic text message she'd sent me a few days ago - ""I'm in trouble, sis. I need your help."" Whatever it was, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. I decided to start by retracing her steps, talking to her friends, and seeing if anyone had any idea where she might be. I began by calling her best friend, Rachel, who answered on the first ring. ""Hey, have you heard from Amber?"" I asked, trying to sound calmer than I felt. There was a pause on the other end of the line before Rachel replied, ""Actually, I was going to call you. I haven't heard from her in weeks, but I did get a weird message from her a few days ago. It said 'They're watching me.' I have no idea what she's talking about, but it freaked me out."" My heart sank as I listened to Rachel's words. This wasn't like Amber at all. She was always the life of the party, never one to be paranoid or scared. Something was definitely wrong, and I was determined to find out what it was."
"“I don’t understand how that woman made this,” Maddy said, going on,",waving a hand over my face. “A fully functional member of society.”,24,"“it looks like it was made by a professional, but she’s just a regular person from what I’ve seen, I mean she doesn’t even have any formal training or anything, she just kind of... does it, and it’s amazing, I wish I could do something like that, but I don’t think I could ever be that talented, I can barely draw a straight line, let alone create something like this, it’s just incredible.”"
This is where we always landed with Mom. Maddy being furious on my,behalf and me reminding her that Mom wasn’t all bad. Sometimes she was wonderful.,27,"left and me trying to calm her down, while Mom attempted to mediate the situation with her usual calm demeanor. It was a familiar scene, one that had played out countless times before, yet it still managed to fill me with a sense of unease. The tension between Maddy and me was palpable, and I could feel it radiating from her like a physical force, making the air around us seem thick and heavy. I glanced over at Mom, hoping she would intervene, but she just smiled weakly and shook her head, as if to say, ""Not now, not here."" The sound of the waves crashing against the shore was the only thing that broke the silence, a constant reminder of the tranquility that surrounded us, a stark contrast to the turmoil that brewed within."
"When my mother was at her best, you could meet her and walk away thinking you’d been in","the presence of a Muse or an angel. This witty, enchanting woman who made you feel interesting and special.",37,"the presence of a queen. She had that kind of aura about her - regal, poised, and commanding. Her eyes sparkled with a deep inner light, and her smile could light up an entire room. But when she was at her worst, it was like the whole world had come crashing down around her. The darkness that descended was palpable, and it was as if the shadows themselves seemed to writhe and twist in agony. I remember the sound of her laughter, the way it could ring out like a bell, but also the way it could curdle and turn to ash in her mouth. My mother was a woman of contradictions, a puzzle I could never quite solve, and it was this that made her so fascinating, and so heartbreaking."
"Maddy’s moms were my foster parents. They’d wanted to be my real parents, but it just never felt right. I had a mom. And I was fourteen when they got me. The imprinting didn’t take. That’s all I could say about it, it just didn’t take. I cared about them.",I called on their birthdays and came back with Maddy for Christmas when we could get it off. They just weren’t… mine. And Maddy knew it. It bothered her. She couldn’t wrap her brain around it and I couldn’t explain it to her in any way that she found acceptable.,100,"They were good people, and I was grateful for the roof they provided over my head and the food they put on the table. But I never felt that deep, unshakeable bond that I'd heard some foster kids talk about. I didn't feel like I was a part of their family, not really. I was more like a long-term guest, someone they were taking care of until I was old enough to take care of myself. It wasn't their fault, and it wasn't mine either. It just was what it was. I'd grown accustomed to the feeling of being on the outside looking in, of being the one who didn't quite fit. And I'd learned to live with it. But sometimes, late at night, when the house was quiet and I was lying in bed, I couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to have a family that felt like my own. To have parents who loved me not just because they wanted to, but because they couldn't help themselves. To have a sense of belonging that went deeper than just a roof and a meal ticket. I'd wonder what it would be like to be imprinted on, to have that deep and abiding connection that Maddy seemed to have with her moms. And then I'd push the thoughts aside, because wondering wasn't going to change anything. I was who I was, and this was my life. I just had to make the best of it."
"Maddy hadn’t come back last night, as promised, and I guess the date went well because he was taking her to breakfast",and then some art exhibit. She wouldn’t be home until dinner. I was off and had nothing to do and nowhere to be.,45," this morning. I was happy for them, but at the same time, I couldn't help but feel a pang of loneliness. It had been a while since I'd been on a date myself, and seeing Maddy and her new beau was a harsh reminder of my own solitary existence. I decided to shake off the feeling and focus on the day ahead, making myself a cup of coffee and sitting down at the kitchen table to check my emails. As I scrolled through my inbox, I stumbled upon a message from an old friend, inviting me to a concert that night. I hadn't seen her in ages, and the prospect of a fun night out was just what I needed to lift my spirits. I quickly typed out a response, accepting the invitation, and felt a sense of excitement wash over me. Maybe this day wouldn't be so dull after all. "
"“Yeah, it had rope bridges and everything. We were on a quick two-week assignment","to Atlanta. Maddy and I had to share a bed, but it was so cool.”",29,"to assess the local wildlife, and the lodge was the perfect place to stay. The owner, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Jack, had been living there for over 20 years and knew the surrounding jungle like the back of his hand. He regaled us with stories of the area's history and the various expeditions that had passed through over the years. Despite the rustic conditions, the lodge had a certain charm to it, and we quickly settled into a comfortable routine. Our days were filled with treks through the dense foliage, camera traps, and endless hours of data collection. The nights, on the other hand, were spent huddled around the fire, swapping stories and sharing laughs with Jack and the other guests. It was a truly immersive experience, one that allowed us to disconnect from the world and reconnect with nature in a way that few people ever get to experience."
“Not today. But when I had lunch with them yesterday we talked about the Reddit thread. I told them about,"you, obviously,” he said. “That’s when Brad gave me his prophecy about you and I being able to break the curse.”",41,"the post that had been going around about the alleged alien sighting in the nearby town. They were both skeptical at first, but as I showed them the pictures and videos, they started to get more and more intrigued. We spent the rest of the lunch discussing the possibility of extraterrestrial life and whether or not we were truly alone in the universe. My friend, Alex, who's always been fascinated by conspiracy theories, was convinced that the government was covering something up, while my other friend, Rachel, was more cautious in her approach, suggesting that we needed more concrete evidence before jumping to conclusions. The conversation was lively and engaging, and it was clear that the Reddit thread had sparked a lot of interest and debate among our group. As we finished our lunch and parted ways, I couldn't help but wonder if there was any truth to the rumors, and whether we would ever find out for sure."
“That is exactly what I was telling Maddy a few weeks ago. Some guy proposed,in front of a whole stadium at this game we went to—and the girl said no.”,31,"to his girlfriend in the middle of the grocery store, and I was like, 'What is wrong with people these days?' I mean, can't they see that's just a recipe for disaster? First of all, it's a public place, so there's all this pressure to say yes, even if you're not entirely sure. And secondly, what if she said no? The whole store would've seen it, and that would've been super embarrassing for the guy. I just don't get why people feel the need to make such a big spectacle out of everything. Can't they just keep it simple and propose in private like a normal person? Maddy was saying that it's romantic and all that, but I just don't see it. I think it's just a bunch of hype, and people are doing it just to get likes on social media. Anyway, I'm just glad I'm not the only one who thinks that way. What do you think about it?"
I pulled up to the high school pickup line and put the car,"in park, then grabbed my phone to look at the picture of Emma. Again.",27,"in park, waiting for my daughter to emerge from the crowded hallway. As I sat there, I couldn't help but think about how fast time had flown by - it seemed like just yesterday I was dropping her off for her first day of kindergarten. Now, she was a confident and independent teenager, with her own interests and friends. I smiled to myself, remembering the countless hours we had spent together, from lazy Sundays to family vacations, and all the memories we had created along the way. Before I knew it, the doors swung open and a sea of students poured out, my daughter's bright smile and waving hand catching my eye as she made her way towards the car."
"A bell rang and kids started pouring out. The last day of summer school. When I saw my brother, Alex, walking with a","group of his friends toward the buses, I rolled down the passenger side window and leaned across the seat. “Hey! Need a ride?”",46,"group of friends, I couldn't help but feel a pang of relief. The long, sweltering days of summer school were finally over, and we could look forward to a well-deserved break. As Alex approached me, a wide grin spread across his face, and he high-fived me in celebration. ""Freedom!"" he exclaimed, pumping his fist in the air. I chuckled and shook my head, smiling at his infectious enthusiasm. We walked together, joining the throngs of students streaming out of the school gates, all of us eager to leave the confines of the classroom behind and indulge in the carefree joys of summer. The warm sunshine and fresh air felt exhilarating as we made our way home, already making plans for the adventures that lay ahead."
"I got up. “I gotta get going,” I said flatly. “Want me to run",this up to Sarah?” I nodded at the bag of food for my sister.,28,"you to the airport or something?” I asked, already knowing the answer. She shook her head, her eyes fixed on the floor. I grabbed my bag and headed for the door, feeling a mix of relief and guilt wash over me. As I reached for the handle, I heard her voice behind me, barely above a whisper. “Hey, wait.” I turned to see her standing up, her eyes red-rimmed. “Be careful, okay?” I nodded, trying to force a smile, but it felt more like a grimace. I took one last look at her, then stepped out into the bright sunlight, feeling like I was leaving a part of myself behind."
"I came in and looked around. “This is new,” I said. She had red LED string lights along",the walls. The whole bedroom was bathed in red. It was sort of depressing. “I got you McDonald’s.”,36,"the edges of the room, and a new coffee table in the center. The walls were painted a lighter shade of blue than before, and there were a few framed photographs I hadn't seen before. I walked over to take a closer look at the pictures, noticing they were all from our trip to the beach last summer. She had also rearranged the furniture, creating a cozy reading nook by the window with a comfortable-looking armchair and a floor lamp. The room felt more inviting and relaxing than it had in a long time. I turned to her and smiled, ""It looks great in here."" She smiled back, looking pleased with herself, and said, ""I'm glad you like it. I was thinking of making some tea, would you like a cup?"""
Maddy looked up. Then her eyes dropped to the laptop I was holding and she somehow immediately,"knew what was about to happen. “No.” She shook her head. “No. No, no, no, no, no. NO.”",35,"knew that something was wrong. Her eyes narrowed slightly as she took a step closer to me, her gaze fixed intently on the screen. I could sense a mix of confusion and concern emanating from her, and I knew I had to break the news gently. I took a deep breath and began to explain, trying to choose my words carefully, but before I could say anything, Maddy's eyes widened in shock as she grasped the situation. She reached out a hand, her fingers brushing against mine as she took the laptop from me, her eyes scanning the screen with a growing sense of unease."
"As we started pulling our bags from the trunk, a brown-haired middle-aged woman came out of",the side of the three-car garage. “Are you Emma?” she said in a thick Mexican accent.,32,"the house, a look of curiosity on her face as she took in the sight of us and our luggage. She was dressed in a pair of worn jeans and a faded t-shirt, and her hair was tied back in a loose ponytail. As she approached us, a friendly smile spread across her face, and she extended a hand in greeting. ""Hi there, I'm Sarah,"" she said, her voice warm and welcoming. ""I'm so glad you made it. We've been expecting you."" She turned to the man who had been driving the car, a tall, lanky individual with a kind face and a mop of curly brown hair. ""This is my husband, John,"" she continued. ""He's the one who's been driving you around all day."" John smiled and nodded at us, his eyes crinkling at the corners. ""It's great to finally meet you in person,"" he said, his voice deep and soothing. As we chatted with Sarah and John, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over me. We had been traveling for hours, and it was nice to finally have arrived at our destination. The house behind Sarah and John was a cozy-looking little bungalow, with a big porch and a garden full of colorful flowers. It looked like the perfect place to relax and unwind after a long day of traveling."
"Maddy scoffed quietly. “Yeah, I don’t think we’re going to",lose the house. They can probably see it from space.”,20,"find any answers here,” she said, her eyes scanning the dusty, cobweb-covered shelves that seemed to stretch on forever. The air was thick with the scent of old books and stale air, and Maddy could feel the weight of years of neglect bearing down on her. She wandered deeper into the room, her footsteps echoing off the walls as she searched for any sign of what they were looking for. But as she delved deeper into the stacks, she couldn't shake the feeling that they were just spinning their wheels, that the answers they sought were hidden behind a door they couldn't find."
Maddy must have been thinking the same thing I was. “Does it rain a,"lot in Minnesota?” she asked, raising her voice over the sound of the old motor.",29,"lot here?” she asked, her eyes scanning the sky as if willing the clouds to part and reveal their secrets. I nodded, feeling a thrill of excitement mixed with a dash of fear. We had been warned about the unpredictable weather in these parts, but nothing could have prepared us for the torrent that was to come. The air was heavy with electricity, and I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end as the wind began to pick up. Suddenly, a loud clap of thunder boomed through the valley, making us both jump. “I think we should find shelter,” Maddy said, her voice low and urgent, as the sky grew darker by the second."
We lugged our bags up the stairs and were sweating by the time we made it to the door. We came in through a screened-in porch that overlooked the lake. Maddy and,I shared a glance. It was adorable. White wicker rocking chairs and a small matching loveseat with thick floral cushions. A cute coffee table and plastic ferns in wrought-iron planters and hanging baskets.,65,"her mom were already there, sipping lemonade and chatting like they'd known each other for years. The smell of fresh-cut grass and the sound of birds chirping filled the air as we dropped our bags and collapsed onto the worn wooden furniture. Maddy's mom, Susan, greeted us with a warm smile and handed us each a glass of lemonade, which we gratefully accepted. As we sipped our drinks, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over me. We'd been planning this trip for months, and it was great to finally be here, surrounded by the peacefulness of nature. The lake sparkled in the sunlight, and I could see a small dock jutting out into the water, where a few kayaks and paddleboats were tied up. Maddy and I exchanged a look, and I knew we were both thinking the same thing: this was going to be an amazing week."
"The bedrooms were off the living room on either side of a short hallway with a single bathroom shared in the middle. The bathroom had a white claw-foot tub, pale blue","tile, and an old pedestal sink. I took the room with the cushioned reading nook in the window and Maddy picked the one with the hanging swing chair in the corner.",62,"walls, and a pedestal sink. The floors were made of dark hardwood and creaked when walked upon. A small linen closet stood at the far end of the hall, its door slightly ajar, revealing stacks of neatly folded towels and washcloths. The bedrooms themselves were simple, with plain white walls and a single window each, letting in a flood of natural light during the day. The furniture was minimal, consisting of a bed, a dresser, and a small desk in each room. Despite the simplicity, the rooms felt cozy, with plush area rugs covering the hardwood floors and colorful quilts adorning the beds. The overall atmosphere was one of quiet comfort, a sense of peaceful refuge from the outside world."
"Four hours later, Maddy and I were back at the cottage sitting in the screened-in porch.",We’d had dinner in town and then boated back. The fridge was stocked up and we’d unpacked.,33,"We sipped lemonade and watched the sun set behind the trees, casting a warm orange glow over the entire scene. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the sound of crickets provided a soothing background hum. It was moments like these that I cherished the most, simple yet profound in their beauty. Maddy and I sat in comfortable silence, enjoying each other's company as the stars began to twinkle in the night sky. The world seemed to slow down, and for a brief moment, everything felt at peace."
She looked away from me. “Emma…” Her eyes came back to mine. “Please. Please do it.,Do it now before you lose the chance to meet them altogether. People don’t live forever.”,32,"Her voice was barely above a whisper, but the desperation in it was palpable. I felt a surge of uncertainty, my mind racing with the weight of what she was asking of me. The room seemed to shrink, the air thickening with tension as I hesitated, unsure of how to respond. Emma's eyes locked onto mine, her gaze burning with an unspoken plea, as if she knew that I was her only hope. I took a deep breath, trying to calm the turmoil brewing inside me, but my heart was already racing with the implications of what I was about to do."
"“How about this,” Maddy said. “Run your DNA and make your account private. We’ll change your privacy settings for a few minutes, poke around. If you have any","relatives out there, we’ll screenshot it and go back to private. Then I’ll go and find them online and tell you if they seem like people worth knowing.”",56,"matches, we can try to find a connection. If not, we can change it back and try something else. But we have to be careful, we don't want to raise any red flags. I've heard of people getting in trouble for messing with their DNA results. What do you say, are you in? Maddy's eyes sparkled with excitement as she waited for a response. The possibility of uncovering a long-lost relative or a hidden family secret was too enticing to resist. With a deep breath, the decision was made, and the journey to uncover the truth began. The room fell silent as the sound of fingers flying across the keyboard filled the air, the only sound breaking the anticipation that hung heavy in the room. As the minutes ticked by, the tension mounted, and the possibilities swirled in their minds like a vortex, drawing them in with an otherworldly force."
We prioritized power for the coffee maker first and we brewed a pot while I sat in the kitchen with,"a towel wrapped around my head. When it was done, Maddy poured me a cup and handed it to me.",40,"my laptop open, trying to get some work done while the aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air. As I waited for the coffee to finish, I thought about how this small luxury was a reminder that even in the midst of a power outage, there were still ways to find comfort and normalcy. The sound of the coffee maker beeping to signal that the brew cycle was complete was music to my ears, and I quickly poured myself a steaming cup. The warmth of the coffee in my hands was a welcome respite from the chill of the morning, and I took a moment to appreciate the simple pleasures in life. As I sipped my coffee, I began to feel a sense of calm wash over me, and I was able to focus on the tasks at hand, the power outage suddenly feeling less daunting."
The snail’s-pace speed the pontoon put out somehow seemed faster with the beach approaching. Maddy threw it in reverse. The engine,"downshifted miserably, but we started to slow. Then to my horror we began to move backward, motor first, right into the dock.",43,"sputtered and coughed, sending up a plume of noxious smoke as it struggled to slow the vessel's momentum. Maddy's eyes darted towards the shore, her heart racing with anticipation. She could see the outlines of people moving about, their faces obscured by the fading light of day. The pontoon finally came to a stop, its hull scraping against the rough sand as the waves gently lapped at its sides. With a sigh of relief, Maddy killed the engine and let the silence wash over her. The stillness was a welcome respite from the din of the engine, and she took a moment to collect her thoughts before turning to face the shore. As she did, a figure emerged from the crowd, their features slowly coming into focus as they approached the water's edge."
"When we were safely away from anything we could crash into, Maddy killed the engine and slumped in the captain’s","seat. “If we’d been on the other side of the dock, we could have hit the yacht,” she said, looking shaken.",41,"chair, her eyes fixed on some point in the distance. I followed her gaze, but there was nothing out there except the endless expanse of water and sky. The silence between us was oppressive, punctuated only by the sound of the waves gently lapping against the hull of the boat. I knew Maddy was trying to process everything that had just happened, but I couldn't help feeling a sense of unease. We had narrowly escaped disaster, but at what cost? The memory of the explosion and the subsequent chaos was still etched vividly in my mind, and I couldn't shake the feeling that we were far from safe. I glanced over at Maddy, wondering if she was thinking the same thing, but her expression was inscrutable. After a few moments of silence, she finally spoke up, her voice barely above a whisper. ""We need to figure out what to do next,"" she said, her eyes still fixed on the horizon. I nodded in agreement, my mind racing with possibilities. We couldn't stay out here forever, but for now, it seemed like the safest option. As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the water, Maddy and I sat in silence, lost in our own thoughts, trying to come up with a plan to get us out of this mess."
"I lined the nose of the boat up with the side of the dock and started for it again, only this time I killed the thrust earlier. We",coasted along the side and I put us into reverse to slow us down while Maddy grabbed one of the dock poles and we came to a stop.,56,"glided smoothly into the gap, the rubber fenders compressing as we made contact with the dock. I let out a sigh of relief as I killed the engine and began to tie us off. The others were already moving to secure their lines, their faces set in determined expressions. As I finished up, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride at having navigated the tricky docking maneuver without incident. The captain gave me a nod of approval as he stepped off the boat and onto the dock, his eyes scanning the surrounding area with a practiced air. We had made it to our destination, but I knew that this was only the beginning of our journey."
"Her phone rang. “Oh, hold on. I have to leave my ringer on in case Maddy gets in trouble trying to get back.” She looked at it. “It’s her.” She swiped and put the",phone to her ear. “Maddy? Are you okay?” She listened for a second and then glanced at me. “Okay.” Then she hung up. She nodded over her shoulder. “Can we go down there really quick?”,69,"phone to her ear. ""Maddy, where are you? I thought you were right behind me."" She listened for a moment, her brow furrowed in concern. ""Okay, stay where you are. I'll come find you."" She turned to the others. ""Maddy's lost. I have to go find her."" She took off in a hurry, leaving the others to wonder what was happening. As she walked, she could hear Maddy's panicked voice on the other end of the line, ""Mom, I don't know where I am. I was following you, but then I saw a really cool exhibit and I stopped to look, and when I turned around, you were gone."" Her mom tried to reassure her, ""It's okay, sweetie. I'll find you. Just stay where you are and I'll be right there."" She quickened her pace, scanning the crowds for a glimpse of her daughter's bright pink jacket. She finally spotted her standing by a large dinosaur display, looking scared and alone. She rushed over and swept Maddy into a tight hug. ""I'm so sorry, baby. I was worried sick about you."" Maddy hugged her back, tears of relief streaming down her face. ""I was so scared, Mommy. I didn't know what to do."" Her mom held her close, feeling a mix of relief and guilt. She should have been more careful, made sure Maddy was right behind her. She made a mental note to be more vigilant for the rest of the day, to make sure this didn't happen again."
I hadn’t really cared too much that Benny might not be here today. He wasn’t the point of this visit. But all that,had changed in the last ten minutes. Now I wanted my friends to meet her so I had someone to talk to about her.,47,"changed when I saw his empty chair. It was a small, insignificant thing, but it felt like a punch to the gut. I had been so focused on what I needed to do, on the conversation I was about to have, that I hadn't stopped to consider how much I was counting on Benny being here. His absence was a reminder that I wasn't in control, that there were still so many variables at play. I took a deep breath and tried to shake off the feeling of unease that was growing inside me. I had a job to do, and I couldn't let Benny's absence derail me. But as I scanned the room, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment. Where was he? And why wasn't he here when I needed him most?"
Jane led us through their living room and down a hall and stopped,by a closed door. “Everything’s ready. You guys can go in when you want.”,27,"in front of a door that looked like it hadn't been opened in years, the air around us growing thick with anticipation as she slowly turned the rusty doorknob and pushed the door creakily open, revealing a room that seemed frozen in time, the walls lined with old bookshelves and the floor cluttered with stacks of dusty boxes and forgotten trinkets, a faint scent of decay and neglect hanging heavy in the air as we stepped cautiously inside, our footsteps echoing off the walls as we began to explore the secrets that this mysterious room had been hiding for so long."
"Her phone rang and she picked it up and looked at it. “Oh, hold on, it’s Maddy. Hello?” She listened for a moment. Then she sucked","air through her teeth. “That’s what the bumpers are for. Well I’m glad you made it, I was worried. Okay. Okay. I will. Bye.” She hung up.",53,"in a deep breath and her eyes widened in surprise. ""What? When did this happen?"" she asked, her voice laced with concern. She listened intently for a few more moments, her expression changing from surprise to shock. ""Okay, I'll be right there,"" she said finally, before hanging up the phone. She turned to face the others, a look of urgency on her face. ""I have to go,"" she said, already grabbing her bag and heading for the door. ""It's Maddy, something's happened and I need to be with her."" She didn't wait for a response, already rushing out of the room, her mind racing with worst-case scenarios. As she hurried out of the building, she couldn't shake off the feeling that her life was about to change in ways she couldn't even imagine."
“I hope so. It’s been a little stressful.” She picked up Murder Mittens. “I don’t think I really thought this island thing through. It,"sounded like a good idea at the time but it’s kind of inconvenient. Anyway, it’s only for six weeks and Maddy likes the cottage, so…”",49,"was supposed to be a relaxing getaway, but so far it's been anything but. I mean, I've been stuck in a small cottage with a bunch of strangers, and we've already had a murder. I'm starting to think I should have just stayed home and watched Netflix like a normal person. But no, I had to go and get all adventurous. And now I'm stuck here, trying to solve a murder mystery with a bunch of people who seem more interested in arguing with each other than in figuring out who killed poor Mr. Jenkins. I sighed and scratched Murder Mittens behind the ears, trying to calm myself down. She purred contentedly and nuzzled my hand, but I could tell she was getting a little bored. I needed to get her out of here before she started causing trouble. I stood up and looked around the room, trying to decide what to do next. The others were all still arguing, and I didn't feel like joining in. I spotted a piece of paper on the table and walked over to investigate. It was a map of the island, with several locations circled. I wondered what they might be, and whether they might be important to the case. I folded up the map and tucked it into my pocket, deciding to do some exploring. Maybe I could find some clues on my own, without having to deal with the drama of the group. I called out to the others, telling them I was going for a walk, and set off into the unknown."
The woman’s eyes moved back and forth over the mouth of her open,Coach bag. Emma took her gently by the elbow. “I’m Emma. What’s your name?”,27,"purse, her fingers hesitating as she searched for the small, crumpled piece of paper she knew was in there somewhere. She had scribbled down the phone number in a hurry, and now she was beginning to worry that she had misplaced it. As she rummaged through the purse's contents, her mind wandered back to the mysterious stranger who had given it to her. Who was he, really? And why had he seemed so insistent that she call him? The questions swirled in her head, but she pushed them aside, focusing on the task at hand. Finally, her fingers closed around the paper, and she pulled it out, smoothing out the wrinkles as she read the scribbled digits. With a sense of trepidation, she reached for her phone and began to dial."
Maddy was already off the pontoon and running toward me across the beach. She skidded to,"a halt in front of me, still catching her breath from the sprint. “This bitch,” she managed.",33,"a stop just short of me, her eyes wide with excitement, and her chest heaving with exertion. ""What is it?"" I asked, but she just grabbed my arm and started pulling me toward the water's edge. ""Come see,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. As we reached the shoreline, I saw it too - a dark shape looming just beneath the surface of the waves. Maddy let out a little gasp and I felt a shiver run down my spine. We stood there frozen, our eyes fixed on the mysterious shape, as the waves gently lapped at our feet."
"Amber was in a flowing white-and-peach chiffon summer dress with a slit up the thigh. Her long brown hair was down, she had on a floppy wide-brimmed hat and huge sunglasses. She was carrying","a bottle of champagne in one hand and her sandals in the other, dangling off the tips of her fingers. She was beaming, running toward us across the beach, kicking up sand. “Emma!” She laughed.",69,"a large straw tote bag and looked like she was on her way to a garden party or a music festival. As she walked, the slit in her dress would occasionally reveal a glimpse of her tanned leg, and the way the sunlight caught her hair made it shine like chestnut. She moved with a confident air, her shoulders back and her head held high, drawing admiring glances from passersby. Despite the heat, she seemed cool and composed, a vision of effortless elegance in the midst of the bustling city. Her destination was unclear, but it was evident that she was a woman on a mission, striding purposefully through the crowds with a sense of determination in her step."
"“Emma, you won’t believe my day,” she said, looking back at me. “So I wanted to surprise you. I flew all the way over here on","a red-eye, got an Uber, and came out to the address you gave me, but when I knocked on the door this handsome man answered instead.”",52,"a whim, just to see you and give you this gift in person. I know it's not your birthday or anything, but I just couldn't wait any longer. I've been thinking about you nonstop since we last spoke, and I had to see you. I hope you're not mad that I just showed up like this. I know I should have called first, but I was afraid you'd tell me not to come. I promise I won't overstay my welcome, I just needed to see you and give you this. It's something I've been working on for a while now, and I think you'll really love it. Are you going to invite me in, or do I have to stand here in the hallway all day?"
“Are you kidding me with this?” Maddy hissed as soon as they were out,of earshot. “She’s here for what? Six hours? And she’s already hypnotized our landlord?”,28,"of the crowded restaurant, her voice barely audible over the sound of the city traffic, but laced with a venom that made Alex take a step back, his eyes scanning the sidewalk to make sure no one was paying attention to their hushed argument. ""What's wrong, Maddy?"" he asked, his tone cautious, though he already knew the answer. Maddy's eyes flashed with anger as she spun around, her long blonde hair whipping around her face. ""You know exactly what I'm talking about, Alex,"" she spat, her words dripping with accusation. ""Don't play dumb with me."""
Maddy crossed her arms. “What she always does? Show up and leave a path of,"destruction in her wake? She’s not staying with us,” she said in her end-of-discussion voice.",30,"destruction in her wake? I swear, every time she comes to town, it's like a tornado has swept through, leaving a trail of broken hearts and shattered dreams. And yet, we always seem to welcome her back with open arms, like a prodigal daughter returning home. I don't know what it is about her, but she has this mesmerizing effect on people, drawing them in with her charm and charisma, only to discard them like yesterday's trash when she's done with them. I've seen it happen time and time again, and yet, I still find myself getting pulled into her orbit, helpless to resist her gravitational pull. It's like I'm a moth to a flame, drawn inexorably towards the very thing that's going to destroy me."
Maddy rolled her eyes in the way that I knew meant she was aware. “Please tell me I don’t have to stay and watch,you eat crustaceans with that woman. Let’s just go back to the island and you see her tomorrow or something when she’s done with what’s-his-face.”,49,"the rest of this train wreck,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. I shot her a warning glance, but she just raised an eyebrow and continued to stare at the scene unfolding before us. The tension in the room was palpable, and I could feel the weight of everyone's expectations bearing down on me. I took a deep breath and tried to focus on the task at hand, but my mind kept wandering back to Maddy and her cryptic comment. What did she know that I didn't? And why was she so determined to get out of there? I pushed the thoughts aside and tried to concentrate on the conversation, but my attention kept drifting back to Maddy, who was now standing with her arms crossed, a look of disdain etched on her face. I knew that look all too well, and it usually meant trouble."
I watched him walk to the beach and I let out a long breath. Maddy was right.,"This was bad. Mom never left anywhere on good terms. Not jobs, or apartments, or relationships. Especially relationships.",35,"He was indeed trying to clear his head, just like she had said. I decided to follow him at a distance, careful not to be seen. The sun was setting over the ocean, casting a warm orange glow over the waves. As I walked, the sound of the surf grew louder and the smell of saltwater filled my lungs. I watched as he reached the water's edge and stood there, staring out at the horizon. His shoulders were slumped, and his head was bowed, and for a moment, I felt a pang of worry. What was going on with him? Why was he so troubled? I wanted to go to him, to ask him what was wrong, but something held me back. Maybe it was the way he was standing, so alone and so lost, or maybe it was the fear of intruding on his private moment. Whatever it was, I stayed where I was, watching him from afar, and wondering what the future held for us."
I felt relieved the instant he said he would stay with me because it let Maddy off the hook. She would walk through hell for,me—and this cookout was her hell. I was glad she didn’t have to be here. Sometimes her reaction to Mom was more stressful than Mom herself.,51,"her family, but I knew she was already shouldering a heavy burden with her mom's illness, and I didn't want to add to it. Now, with him by my side, I felt a sense of calm wash over me, and I could finally focus on the task at hand. We spent the rest of the day gathering our gear and preparing for the long journey ahead, the tension between us dissipating with each passing hour. As night began to fall, we settled in around a roaring campfire, the flames casting flickering shadows on the trees surrounding us. The sound of crickets and the occasional hoot of an owl filled the air, a soothing melody that seemed to lull the world into a peaceful slumber. In that moment, I felt grateful for his presence, and I knew that together, we could face whatever lay ahead."
"“Thanks.” I looked back at the lake, at Maddy fading into",the distance on the pontoon. “And thanks for pushing her off.”,22,"the distance, her small figure becoming one with the trees and the mist that rose from the water like a veil of secrecy. I felt a pang in my chest, a mix of emotions I couldn't quite untangle, as I turned to follow the others back to the cabin. The crunch of gravel beneath our feet was the only sound that broke the stillness of the morning, and I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets this place held, secrets that only revealed themselves to those who lingered long enough to listen."
"Maddy had been right about his height. He was probably about six-one. He was on the leaner side, but",toned. I’d had to put sunblock on him and there was not a single part of that that I disliked.,39,"his broad shoulders and well-defined jawline gave him an air of confidence that was hard to ignore. His eyes, a deep shade of brown, seemed to hold a hint of warmth, and his dark hair was perfectly messy, as if he'd just rolled out of bed. He flashed a charming smile, and Maddy felt a flutter in her chest, which she quickly pushed aside, reminding herself that she was here for a job, not to get caught up in some fleeting attraction. As he approached, his long strides eating up the distance, Maddy couldn't help but notice the way his worn jeans hugged his legs, or the way his faded band t-shirt clung to his chest. She felt a flush rise to her cheeks, and she looked away, trying to compose herself before he reached her side."
"“He’ll probably completely forget we even exist,” she mumbled, resting her head on","the cushion. “Amber has a way of making people do that,” she said tiredly.",27,"the windowsill, her eyes drifting shut as the rhythmic hum of the engine and the gentle rocking motion of the bus lulled her into a state of semi-consciousness. The soft murmur of the other passengers and the occasional burst of laughter from the back of the bus created a soothing background noise that seemed to wash away her worries, at least for the time being. As she slipped further into her reverie, her thoughts began to wander back to the events of the past few days, and the uncertainty that lay ahead."
"Now I blew out a long breath. “Well, she’s funny. Hardworking. She reads any book she can get her hands on and she remembers everything she reads, even years later. She had me really","young. Same age Amber had you, actually. She’s a good mom, always shows up for us—school stuff, birthdays. She makes these Italian cookies every Christmas and Easter that make me think of my childhood.”",68,"laughing with some of the things she came up with. I mean, she's got a great sense of humor, but she's also got a lot of heart. She's always looking out for other people, even when they don't deserve it. And she's got this quirky little smile that just lights up a room. I found myself smiling back at her, feeling a sense of ease that I hadn't felt in a long time. As I got to know her better, I realized that she was more than just a pretty face and a quick wit - she was a kind and caring person who genuinely wanted to make a difference in the world. And that, I had to admit, was pretty attractive. I couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to spend more time with her, to see where things might go. But for now, I was just happy to enjoy her company and see where the night took us."
"When I got back to the cottage an hour later, Maddy was in the screened-in porch, reading. She","wore shorts and flip-flops, and she was drinking a beer. She set down her book when I came in.",37,"looked up as I came in, a look of quiet contemplation on her face. The book was one I had seen before, a collection of poetry by a local author. She closed the book and set it aside, then stood up and stretched, her eyes never leaving mine. ""How was your walk?"" she asked, her voice low and soothing. I hesitated for a moment, unsure of how to answer. The walk had been fine, but my mind had been elsewhere, consumed by thoughts of the strange encounter in the woods. I decided to keep that to myself, not wanting to worry Maddy. ""It was nice,"" I said finally, trying to sound casual. ""I saw some beautiful wildflowers."" Maddy smiled and nodded, seeming to accept my answer at face value. We stood there for a moment, the only sound the creaking of the old wooden porch and the distant call of a bird. Then Maddy spoke up again, her voice a little softer. ""I've been thinking,"" she said. ""Maybe we should head back to the city tomorrow."" I felt a pang of surprise, and a little disappointment. I had been enjoying our time in the cottage, and the thought of leaving so soon was unwelcome. But I knew Maddy had her reasons, and I trusted her judgment. ""Okay,"" I said finally, trying to sound agreeable. ""If you think that's best."" Maddy nodded, looking relieved. ""I do,"" she said. ""I'll start packing up tonight."" And with that, our little vacation was effectively over."
"“Yup. The things you cared about. The stuff you’d take in a fire,",or if Amber showed up to get you. You never once unpacked. Not really.”,27,"the memories you'd hold onto when everything else was gone. It was funny how those things could be so different from what you thought they'd be when you were younger. As a kid, you might have thought it'd be your favorite toy or book, but as an adult, it was the little things that took on a new significance - a photo of your family, a piece of jewelry that had been passed down, or even just a certain smell that reminded you of home. It was as if your priorities shifted, and what was once important became trivial in the face of new experiences and relationships. But no matter what, those things you'd take in a fire remained a constant, a reminder of what truly mattered in the end."
"I swear to God, I smell like rust,” Maddy whispered, sniffing her arm.",“Do I smell like rust? That water at the cottage is so gross.”,26,"Her friend Emily giggled and sniffed her own arm, ""I think it's just the old water pipes in this place, we've been exploring for hours."" Maddy raised an eyebrow, ""You really think that's it? I could've sworn I showered this morning."" Emily playfully rolled her eyes, ""You did, but have you seen the state of the water coming out of those taps? It's like liquid metal."" Maddy chuckled, ""Liquid metal, that's a good one."" As they both stood there, they heard a faint creaking noise coming from the depths of the abandoned building, and their smiles quickly faded."
He grinned back and forth between us. “Maybe we can get together for dinner later this,"week, once you’ve gotten settled in,” he said. “Amber and I would love to have you.”",32,"week and discuss the details of the project,"" he suggested, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm. I exchanged a look with Sarah, and we both nodded in agreement. ""Sounds like a plan,"" I said, and we made a mental note to clear our schedules for the evening. As we parted ways, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation for the dinner meeting. Little did I know, this chance encounter would be the start of a beautiful friendship and a successful collaboration that would change the course of our lives forever."
It was never going to happen. I knew this. But Maddy wouldn’t let it go unless,"I tried—and really, I should try. Maddy was right, this whole situation was a ticking time bomb.",33,"she had exhausted every last avenue, and even then she would probably keep going, fueled by a stubborn determination that I both admired and found infuriating. I had seen her like this before, when she was researching a story and refused to back down, even when the trail went cold and the leads dried up. But this was different. This was personal. And I knew that she wouldn't rest until she had uncovered the truth, no matter how painful it might be."
"I paused, not sure how much I wanted to share. I decided on all of it. Emma was going to","be here when it all hit the fan anyway, so there was no point in keeping her in the dark.",40,"know everything, and I trusted her enough to handle it. I took a deep breath and began, my words spilling out in a rush as I recounted the events of the past few days. Emma listened intently, her expression a mixture of concern and curiosity. As I spoke, I could see the pieces falling into place in her mind, her eyes widening as she grasped the implications. When I finally finished, she sat back in her chair, a thoughtful look on her face. ""We need to talk to Jack,"" she said finally, her voice firm. ""He's the only one who can help us now."" I nodded in agreement, feeling a sense of relief wash over me. I had shared my secret, and it felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. But as we sat there, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were running out of time."
"I studied the woman sitting next to me. Imagine someone who went through what she did, turning out the way she had. Able to give",grace to someone who’d let her down so badly. Emma was a better person than I was. And my life had been gentler than hers too.,51,"and receive love, to be so full of life and laughter. It was a truly remarkable thing. I, on the other hand, had been through much less and yet I was still struggling to find my place in the world. As I sat there, I couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for this woman and her strength. She was a reminder that no matter what life throws at us, we always have a choice in how we respond. We can let our experiences break us, or we can use them to make us stronger. I felt a sense of determination wash over me as I realized that I had the power to choose my own path, just like the woman sitting next to me. I took a deep breath, feeling a sense of hope that I hadn't felt in a long time, and began to think about the possibilities that lay ahead."
I might kiss her tonight. I almost did the other night at the,"dock, but then Amber showed up. I was looking forward to the do-over.",26,"movies, but I didn't want to ruin the moment by being too forward. I've been thinking about it ever since, wondering if I should have just gone for it. Maybe tonight will be different, maybe I'll find the courage to take a chance and see how she reacts. The thought of it is making me nervous, but in a good way, like my heart is skipping a beat in anticipation. I just hope I don't mess it up or make things awkward between us. I care about her too much to risk losing our connection, but at the same time, I feel like I need to take this chance and see where it takes us."
I’d tried to be softer with her the last few days. The energy shift I’d had over Mom after my talk with Emma,"was almost as bad as being mad at her. At least when I was mad, I didn’t feel the guilt I was feeling now.",47,"still lingered, and I found myself wanting to extend that same compassion to Rachel. I knew she was struggling, and I wanted to be a source of comfort for her, rather than a source of stress. I took a deep breath and walked into the kitchen, where she was sitting at the table, staring blankly at her coffee. I slid into the chair across from her and reached out, putting a gentle hand on her arm. ""Hey, Rach, what's going on?"" I asked softly, trying to keep my tone light. She looked up at me, her eyes red-rimmed from lack of sleep, and I could see the weight of the world bearing down on her. I squeezed her arm reassuringly, trying to convey that I was there for her, that I would support her through whatever was going on. ""Just work stuff,"" she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. ""It's just been really tough lately."" I nodded sympathetically, trying to think of something to say that would help. But before I could come up with anything, she spoke up again. ""And it's not just work,"" she said, her voice cracking. ""It's everything. I just feel so lost and alone, like I'm just going through the motions of life without any real purpose."" My heart went out to her, and I felt a surge of love and protectiveness towards my sister. I wanted to fix everything for her, to make all her problems disappear. But I knew that wasn't possible, so I just sat there, holding her hand and listening, trying to be present for her in the midst of her pain."
"This was another thing I was trying not to think about—her leaving. I should be happy that she came at all, that she wasn’t in Hawaii. We still had three more dates, maybe more if I could convince her. I’d already gotten a freebie the other night at","Mom’s. But I dreaded the clock running out. Emma was the only good thing happening to me at the moment and when she was gone, not only would I lose her, I’d be left sitting in my new reality. Dad gone, Mom in prison. Me with all the children.",97,"the restaurant, and I was hoping to get another one tonight. I had been racking my brain, trying to come up with the perfect plan to make this night unforgettable. I wanted to make her feel special, to make her see that I was the one she should be with. I had already made reservations at her favorite restaurant, and I had even arranged for a surprise visit to the art gallery she loved. I was determined to make this night one to remember, to make her forget all about her plans to leave. As I got ready for our date, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nervous excitement. What if she said no to my plans? What if she didn't feel the same way? I pushed the thoughts aside and focused on the task at hand. I was going to make this night perfect, no matter what it took. I took a deep breath, grabbed my keys, and headed out the door, ready to face whatever the night had in store."
"“Yeah,” I said. “Thank you. There’s actually something else you can help me with too,” I","said, looking at them. “I need help making sure I can still see Emma until she goes.”",33,"added, trying to sound casual despite the fact that my heart was racing with anticipation. ""I'm trying to find some information about a local legend, and I was wondering if you might know anything about it."" The old man's expression changed, and for a moment, I thought I saw a flicker of something like fear in his eyes. But then, his face smoothed out again, and he leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers together as he regarded me thoughtfully. ""What kind of legend?"" he asked, his voice low and even. I hesitated, unsure of how much to reveal, but something about the old man's demeanor put me at ease. ""It's about a place,"" I said finally. ""A place that's supposed to be hidden somewhere in these woods. They call it the Devil's Hollow."" The old man's eyes narrowed, and he leaned forward again, his elbows on his knees. ""Go on,"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper."
Emma pulled two Ziploc bags from her purse. They had Wheat Thins and celery in them. Probably her,"work snacks. “I trust this zipper seal with my life,” she said, turning to hand them to our passengers.",37,"snack for the day, she thought, as she began to munch on the crunchy crackers and crisp celery sticks. The combination was a satisfying one, and she felt a sense of contentment wash over her as she sat in the quiet café, people-watching through the large windows. The sounds of the city outside created a gentle hum in the background, a soothing accompaniment to her solitary lunch. As she ate, Emma's thoughts turned to the meeting she had scheduled for later that afternoon, and she mentally reviewed the notes she had prepared, feeling a sense of confidence and preparedness. The snack was just what she needed to refuel and tackle the rest of her day."
"I think I would have been embarrassed if I’d been on a date with anyone else. My mother, sobbing drunk the night before",she left for prison. But I knew Emma didn’t judge. That’s just not how she was. She judged this situation less than I did.,47,"my wedding, had managed to pull herself together enough to make it to the ceremony, but I could tell she was still feeling the effects of the previous night's festivities. As we exchanged our vows, I couldn't help but notice the faint smell of last night's wine wafting from her direction, and I had to stifle a giggle. Luckily, my fiancé seemed oblivious to it all, and the ceremony went off without a hitch. But as we made our way to the reception, I couldn't help but wonder what other surprises the day might hold. My mother, still a bit unsteady on her feet, grabbed the microphone and launched into a slurred but heartfelt toast, leaving me mortified but also strangely touched by her antics. It was definitely a wedding day I would never forget, and I could only hope that the rest of the day would be a little less eventful."
"When she finished handing out Kleenex, Emma stayed turned in her seat.","“You know,” she said, “I worked for three months in a women’s prison.”",25,"She stared blankly at the back of the seat in front of her, her mind still reeling from the emotional outburst that had just occurred. The sound of sniffles and muffled sobs filled the air as her classmates struggled to compose themselves. Emma's eyes began to well up again, but she fought back the tears, not wanting to break down in front of everyone. She took a few deep breaths, trying to calm herself down, and slowly turned back around to face the front of the classroom. The teacher, Mrs. Johnson, was standing at the whiteboard, a look of concern etched on her face as she surveyed the room. Emma wondered what would happen next, and whether things would ever go back to normal."
It was funny that two pivotal moments in my life were happening at the exact same time and at complete odds with each,other. I didn’t know how to balance what was going on with my family and what was going on with my feelings for Emma.,47,"other. On one hand, I was finally starting to find my footing in my career, landing a job at a prestigious company and receiving recognition from my peers. On the other hand, my personal life was in shambles, as I was going through a messy breakup with my long-term partner. It was as if the universe was testing my ability to balance two opposing forces, pushing me to my limits and forcing me to re-evaluate my priorities. As I navigated this tumultuous period, I couldn't help but wonder if these two events were somehow connected, if the success in one area of my life was coming at the cost of another. I felt like I was being pulled in two different directions, and I wasn't sure which path to choose. Despite the uncertainty, I knew I had to keep moving forward, to find a way to reconcile these conflicting forces and emerge stronger on the other side."
"What did I have to offer her? I had nothing but baggage. Emotionally damaged, traumatized children that had been catapulted from one tragedy to the next, and me, barely keeping my head above water. Would I even have the time or the bandwidth to be any kind of partner while I was helping my",siblings navigate this situation? What was the point in even hoping for anything to be different between Emma and me? To what? Pull her from her glamorous jet-setting life to ground her with me in this fucking mess? I’d feel like apologizing every day. There was no way I could ever be worth it.,108,"children navigate their own trauma and grief? I felt like I was drowning in my own emotions, and the thought of taking on someone else's was overwhelming. But at the same time, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had a deep connection with her, one that went beyond just physical attraction. I wanted to be with her, to explore this connection and see where it would take us. But how could I do that when I was still trying to pick up the pieces of my own life? I felt like I was being pulled in two different directions, and I didn't know which way to turn. As I stood there, frozen in indecision, I realized that I had to make a choice. I could let my fears and doubts hold me back, or I could take a chance and see where things would go. It was a scary thought, but it was also exhilarating. I took a deep breath and made my decision. I would take a chance, no matter how uncertain the outcome may be. I would be vulnerable, open myself up to the possibility of getting hurt, and see if this connection between us was real. It was a risk, but it was one I was willing to take."
Sarah gave him a look. “Maybe for you. Hanging out with my brother,isn’t my idea of a good time. I’ll be outside. I want to go.”,27,"is not exactly my idea of a good time, especially when he's in one of his moods. I swear, sometimes I think he forgets that I'm his sister, not one of his buddies from the football team. And don't even get me started on how he always tries to give me advice, like I'm some kind of clueless little kid who can't take care of herself. Newsflash, bro: I'm a grown woman, and I can handle my own life, thank you very much. But despite all that, I have to admit that I'm a little curious about what he's been up to lately. He's been acting really secretive, always sneaking off to who-knows-where and refusing to tell me what's going on. It's like he's hiding something, and I'm determined to find out what it is."
"“Emma, go meet him at the door, or I will lose my shit. I didn’t push a clunky car stroller around the universe’s largest mall for five hours so you could shake hands","with this guy on the way out. As soon as he shows up, I’m going to park around the front at the lobby to give you some privacy. Go get your damn forehead kiss.”",67,"with some sweaty, acne-ridden teenager who can't even be bothered to wear matching socks. I swear, if I have to spend one more minute trapped in this sea of screaming children and mediocre food court options, I'm going to lose it. And don't even get me started on the existential dread that comes with realizing I'm now the same age as the parents who used to terrify me when I was a teenager. Just go, Emma, go! Put on a smile, pretend to be interested in whatever inane chatter he's going to spew, and for the love of all things holy, just get this over with. I need a drink, or three, after this ordeal."
“So he would come home and see you there. Or because she was bored,"and lonely. FYI, Amber only ever calls you when it serves Amber,” she said.",28,"and needed someone to talk to, she would often find herself opening up to him about her day, sharing stories and laughter around the dinner table. As time went by, their conversations grew more in-depth, and they discovered a deep and abiding connection that went far beyond a simple friendship. They found solace in each other's company, a sense of comfort and security that they had not known before. And as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, their bond continued to grow, a slow-burning flame that illuminated the darkest corners of their lives."
"I always thought it was a proximity thing. She traveled a lot, she changed jobs all the time, she was busy, she","was dealing with whatever Amber dealt with. But now I couldn’t rationalize why nothing was different, even though she was right here.",44,"had a million excuses for why we couldn't meet up, and I just assumed it was because she didn't have the time or energy to maintain a long-distance friendship. But the truth is, I was wrong. It wasn't about the distance or her busy schedule; it was about something much deeper. As I reflect on our friendship, I realize that she was always a bit of an enigma, someone who kept people at arm's length. I remember how she would share stories about her childhood, her family, and her dreams, but there was always a sense of detachment, a feeling that she was holding back. I never pushed her to open up more, assuming that she would share more when she was ready. But as the years went by, I began to realize that maybe she wasn't holding back because she was shy or introverted, but because she was protecting herself from getting hurt. And I wonder now if I was just a small part of her strategy to keep people from getting too close."
He nodded over his shoulder. “I should probably let you get back to work. I have to go pick,"up Alex and take him to a doctor’s appointment.” He paused. “Am I allowed to hug you goodbye, or…?”",38,"up my sister from the airport. She's flying in from college for the holidays and my mom is making a big dinner tonight. I'm really looking forward to seeing her, it's been a while. I hope the traffic isn't too bad, I don't want to be late. I'm sure she's going to have a lot to tell us about her semester. I've heard rumors that she's been doing some interesting research for one of her classes, so I'm excited to hear all about it. Anyway, I should probably get going, nice running into you."
"“The whole house has it. I probably have it,” I added. “Sarah’s having a",panic attack. I have to go help. I can’t leave them there infested with bugs.”,29,"meltdown because she thinks she's going to have to miss her favorite TV show tonight if we can't figure out how to fix the cable. I tried calling the cable company, but of course, they're not answering. I'm starting to get frustrated because this is the third time this month we've had issues with our service. I'm thinking about switching to a different provider, but Sarah is being stubborn and refuses to give up on our current one. She's convinced that it's just a minor glitch and that it'll be fixed soon. I hope she's right, but I'm not holding my breath. In the meantime, I'm going to go check the connection again and see if I can troubleshoot the problem."
I took her hand and did my best to make my face straight. People were already stopping to watch. I made,"my voice low so only she could hear it. “Emma, would you do me the honor of delousing my family with me?”",43,"myself walk slowly, trying to appear nonchalant despite the commotion we were causing. The woman's hand felt fragile in mine, but she didn't pull away. Instead, she seemed to lean into me, her eyes fixed on some point ahead. I followed her gaze, but there was nothing out of the ordinary to see - just the usual crowded street scene. Still, I sensed that she was drawing me toward something, or someone. I had no idea what to expect, but my curiosity was piqued. As we walked, the onlookers began to disperse, losing interest in the strange couple. But I could feel their eyes on us, wondering what our story was. I wondered that myself."
"“She’ll be home one day, Sarah. It’ll come faster than you think. You can visit her and write to her and call her.","You can stay close to her—you just have to try. I know this is hard, but good things can still come out of it.”",47,"But for now, you have to be strong and focus on your own life. Your mom is in a place where she can get the help she needs, and that's the best thing for her right now. It's not forever, just for a little while. You can still have a great time with your friends and family, and make new memories while she's away. And before you know it, she'll be back home with you, and things will go back to normal. Just remember, she loves you very much and is doing this for her own well-being, so she can be an even better mom to you when she returns."
Sarah was practically bouncing. “I can’t believe he said yes. Mom never,lets me do anything. She won’t even let me get my ears pierced.”,25,"lets me do anything I want, and now I get to go to the concert with Emily. I've been listening to their new album nonstop and I know every single word to every song. I'm going to sing my heart out and dance all night long. I just hope we can get close enough to the stage to see the lead singer's face. I've had a crush on him for ages. I'm going to wear my favorite band t-shirt and my new black jeans, and I'm going to make sure my hair looks perfect. This is going to be the best night of my life, I just know it."
"In that moment, maybe for the first time ever for me, she looked like a little",girl. She was a little girl. I recognized the mask Sarah wore for what it was.,32,"girl, vulnerable and scared, rather than the confident and self-assured woman I had grown accustomed to. Her eyes, usually bright and full of life, were wide with fear, and her voice trembled as she whispered my name. I felt a surge of protectiveness wash over me, and I instinctively reached out to wrap my arms around her, pulling her close as I tried to reassure her that everything would be okay. But as I held her, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that this was more than just a simple moment of fear. There was something deeper at play, something that I couldn't quite put my finger on, but it was there, lurking just beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered."
"After we finished with the lice, I set up the blanket in the backyard. With the landscaping Mom did, it was pretty nice back there with its hanging lights, citronella candles, and magnolia trees. I ordered a","pizza, connected my phone to a Bluetooth speaker, and poured the wine I brought, and Emma and I hung out and talked. Mom had a giant Jenga and we set that up and played a few rounds.",74,"picnic basket from a local deli and we spent the rest of the evening eating sandwiches and chips under the twinkling lights. The smell of citronella filled the air, keeping the mosquitoes at bay, and the sound of crickets provided a soothing background hum. As we sat there, I couldn't help but think about how nice it was to have a peaceful evening at home after the chaos of dealing with the lice infestation. My mom smiled at me, and I could tell she was thinking the same thing. We chatted about our day, and I told her about the different things I had learned in school. The stars began to come out, and we lay down on the blanket, gazing up at the night sky, feeling grateful for this little slice of tranquility in our busy lives."
"“I’m a surgeon, Amber. I don’t have a nine-to-five, I stay until","it’s done, I can’t answer the phone in the middle of an appendectomy—”",25,"the job is done, no matter how long it takes. I've seen it all, from the most routine procedures to the most complex and high-stakes operations. And I've learned that every patient, every case, is unique and requires a different approach. But one thing remains constant: my commitment to saving lives and making a difference, one surgery at a time. It's a tough job, but it's also the most rewarding thing I've ever done. And I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world."
"Amber drew her arm back and threw the large glass thing again, only this","time it bounced off the car’s hood, hit the concrete, and broke in half.",28,"time it shattered against the wall with a deafening crash, sending shards of glass flying in all directions, and for a moment, the room fell silent, as if everyone was holding their breath, waiting to see what would happen next, and then, like a dam breaking, the sound of shattering glass was replaced by the sound of screams and shouts, as people scrambled to get out of the way of the flying shards, and Amber stood there, her arm still outstretched, her eyes fixed on the spot where the glass had hit the wall, a look of shock and horror on her face, as if she couldn't believe what she had just done."
"“I have the van,” he said, his hands wandering. “Alex can’t drive it yet, so",it’s just sitting there. Uber the next time you come over and take my car home.”,31,"it looks like I’m the only one who can get us out of here. I was thinking we could make a run for the coast, try to find a boat or something. We can’t stay here, not with those things outside. They’ll tear us apart if they catch us. I’ve got the keys, let’s move, now. We need to get as far away from this place as possible, and fast. I can hear them, they’re getting closer. Come on, let’s go, we have to go, now."
He slipped a hand into my underwear and I sucked in a breath of air. “What time does,"Alex get up for the bus?” I whispered, tipping my head back as he nibbled on my ear.",36,"your flight leave?” he whispered, his warm breath dancing across my skin, sending shivers down my spine. I tried to focus on the question, but his fingers tracing the edge of my underwear made it difficult to think. The sensation was both exhilarating and terrifying, like standing on the edge of a cliff, staring into the unknown. I swallowed hard, trying to find my voice, but it caught in my throat. The sound of the party outside seemed to fade away, leaving only the two of us, suspended in this moment of uncertainty. I managed to stammer out a reply, my voice barely above a whisper, ""I...I don't know."" His fingers stilled, and for a moment, we just stood there, the tension between us palpable. Then, he slowly withdrew his hand, leaving me feeling both relieved and disappointed. He stepped back, his eyes locked on mine, and I felt like he could see right through me. ""We should get you to the airport,"" he said, his voice low and husky, sending a shiver down my spine. I nodded, still trying to process what had just happened, and what it meant for us."
"I came downstairs still in my pajamas, following the smell of bacon, glad I was actually in the right headspace to eat with everyone. When the stair creaked","as I made my way to the kitchen, Sarah poked her head out the door and saw me coming. “She’s here!” She darted back the way she came.",56,"under my foot, I winced, hoping I hadn't just given away my presence to the rest of the household. But as I turned the corner into the kitchen, I was greeted by the warm smiles of my family, all of whom were already seated at the table. My mom was expertly flipping strips of bacon in a pan, while my dad was pouring glasses of freshly squeezed orange juice. My little sister, Emily, was bouncing up and down in her seat, excitement radiating from her very pores. I slid into my usual spot, feeling a sense of comfort and normalcy wash over me. It was moments like these that I cherished, when the chaos of everyday life seemed to melt away and all that was left was the simple joy of being together as a family.
