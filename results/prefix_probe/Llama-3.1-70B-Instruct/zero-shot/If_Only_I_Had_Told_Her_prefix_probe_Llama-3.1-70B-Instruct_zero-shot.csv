I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that,"we were crashing at my house, and I felt it was my duty to be the one to take the blows.","they were getting a bit too cozy, and I didn't want things to escalate into something that",41,"they were getting a bit too cozy, and I didn't want things to escalate into something that might make our group dynamic awkward. As we walked, I made small talk with Autumn, asking her about her favorite hiking spots and trying to steer the conversation towards more neutral topics. Jack seemed to take the hint and fell back a bit, chatting with Emily instead. I breathed a silent sigh of relief, hoping that I had averted a potentially uncomfortable situation. But as the night wore on, I couldn't shake the feeling that Jack's interest in Autumn was more than just friendly, and I wondered if I had just delayed the inevitable."
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.","Autumn's boyfriend, Alex—started teasing her about being such a scaredy-cat.

They joked that she was so frightened by the movie that she would probably have nightmares for weeks. Autumn just rolled her eyes and laughed it off, but I could tell she was a bit annoyed. As we walked home, Jack and Alex continued to poke fun at her, making spooky noises and jumping out from behind trees to try and scare her. Autumn tried to play it cool, but I could see the fear lurking in her eyes. I felt a bit bad for her, but at the same time, I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. The teasing continued for the rest of the evening, with Jack and Alex taking turns trying to spook Autumn. But as the night wore on, their jokes started to wear thin, and Autumn began to get more and more agitated. I could tell she was getting tired of being the butt of their jokes, and I started to worry that things might escalate into a full-blown argument. Just as it seemed like things were about to get out of hand, we arrived at Autumn's house, and she quickly bid us goodnight, escaping into the safety of her bedroom. As we walked back to our own house, Jack and Alex were still chuckling about their prank, but I couldn't shake the feeling that they had taken things a bit too far."
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.","My heart is racing, and I can feel my face growing hot with anticipation. I try to calm myself",36,"My heart is racing, and I can feel my face growing hot with anticipation. I try to calm myself down, taking slow, deep breaths, but my mind is already racing with possibilities. I can sense Jack's presence, his eyes on me, and I wonder what he's thinking. Is he feeling the same way? The air is thick with tension, and I can feel the weight of the moment settling in. I slowly open my eyes, and our gazes meet, the connection between us palpable. The room seems to fade away, leaving only the two of us, suspended in this moment of uncertainty."
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,"to glance around nervously, as if he's worried someone might be listening in. I follow his gaze, but all I see",41,"to glance around nervously, as if he's worried someone might be listening in. I follow his gaze, but all I see is the dense forest surrounding us, the trees towering above like sentinels. I turn back to Jack, my eyes narrowing slightly. ""I'm trying to figure out what's going on,"" I whisper, my voice barely audible over the sound of the wind rustling through the leaves. ""And as for her,"" I nod toward the tent, ""I think she's in some kind of trouble. I've been trying to get her to talk, but she just keeps saying she can't remember anything."" Jack's eyes flicker with concern, and he takes a step closer to me. ""What do you mean she can't remember anything?"" he asks, his voice low and urgent. I hesitate, unsure how much to reveal, but something about Jack's expression makes me trust him. ""I think she might have amnesia,"" I say finally, the words spilling out in a rush. ""She doesn't know who she is, where she is, or how she got here. And I think someone might be trying to hurt her."" Jack's face sets in a determined expression, and he nods once, sharply. ""We need to get her out of here,"" he says. ""Now."""
"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with","the word “type.” Autumn makes a noise in the tent, and we both hold our breaths and listen.","e words ""I'm sorry.""

He looks up at me with a mixture of exhaustion and frustration etched on his face. I can tell he's been up all night, probably thinking about the same things I have. The dim light of the room casts shadows under his eyes, making him look older than he is. I feel a pang of sympathy for him, and my initial anger starts to dissipate. ""What's going on, Jack?"" I ask softly, trying to keep my tone neutral. He sighs and runs a hand through his hair, a gesture I've seen him do countless times before when he's stressed. ""I don't know, okay? I just feel like everything is falling apart,"" he says, his voice barely above a whisper. I nod, encouraging him to continue, and he takes a deep breath before launching into a long, rambling explanation of his thoughts and fears."
"“Zoned out the way she does? You have been so, so…","Like last week!” Jack asks, “How could you have missed that game?”","preoccupied lately, and I'm starting to get worried that something's",23,"preoccupied lately, and I'm starting to get worried that something's going on that you're not telling me.

Sarah shot him a disapproving look, her eyes flashing with anger. ""Are you kidding me, Jack? You think a movie is going to fix this?"" she snapped, her voice low and even. The others shifted uncomfortably in their seats, avoiding eye contact with each other. The air was thick with unspoken words, and it seemed like the night was only going to get more awkward. Emily, who had been quiet until now, spoke up, her voice soft but firm. ""I think we should talk about what happened. We can't just ignore it and expect everything to go back to normal."" The room fell silent, as if everyone was waiting for someone else to make the first move."
"I walk Jack to his car, and when he turns to me with that","look on his face, I know what he’s going to say. I open my mouth.","smile, I feel a flutter in my chest that I quickly try to brush off",29,"smile, I feel a flutter in my chest that I quickly try to brush off as mere friendship. We've been friends for years, after all, and I'm not about to let some silly infatuation ruin that. But as he leans in to give me a hug, his warm breath on my ear sends shivers down my spine, and I wonder if maybe, just maybe, there's something more to this feeling. I push the thought aside and step back, trying to play it cool, but my heart is racing with a mix of excitement and trepidation. ""Drive safe,"" I say, trying to sound casual, and Jack nods, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiles back at me. As I watch him drive away, I'm left standing there, feeling a little lost and a lot confused."
"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke. Surely the school administrators knew we had always been together, were meant to be together.

We had been inseparable since kindergarten, and the thought of navigating the cafeteria without my partner in crime was daunting. I scanned the crowded room, searching for a familiar face, and that's when I saw him – Jack, with his messy brown hair and bright blue eyes, sitting alone at a table near the window. He looked just as lost as I felt, and I found myself drawn to him. I took a deep breath, grabbed my tray, and made my way over, introducing myself with a nervous smile. Little did I know, that chance encounter would be the start of an unlikely friendship that would change the course of my middle school experience forever."
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time. I didn’t sit down because I recognized Jack though; I simply sat at the first empty seat, defeated. But Jack remembered me. He asked me if I ever watched pro soccer.

It was as if time had slowed down, and all that existed was the two of us, locked in a silent understanding. I cleared my throat, trying to break the spell, and asked him if he was okay. He blinked, and his gaze dropped back to his food, but not before I saw a flicker of something in his eyes - a hint of a secret, a whisper of a truth that only he knew. My curiosity was piqued, and I found myself leaning in, eager to hear what he had to say. ""Hey, can I ask you something?"" he said, his voice low and conspiratorial, and I nodded, my heart beating just a little bit faster. ""What's going on with you and Sarah?"" he asked, his eyes narrowing slightly as he waited for my response. I felt a surge of surprise - how did he know about Sarah and me? And what did he want to know? I hesitated, unsure of how much to reveal, but something about Jack's expression put me at ease, and I found myself opening up to him in ways I never thought possible."
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.","he looked at me with a mixture of confusion and curiosity.

Jack's eyes darted back to me, and I could sense his unspoken questions. I knew I had to intervene before things got awkward. ""Hey, let's grab some coffee and catch up,"" I suggested, trying to steer the conversation towards safer topics. As we walked to the coffee shop, Jack couldn't help sneaking glances at Autumn, his expression a mix of fascination and bewilderment. Autumn, on the other hand, chatted away, seemingly oblivious to the commotion she had caused. I found myself wondering how much I should reveal about her transformation, and whether Jack would ever be able to see her the way I did – as the same kind and caring person she had always been."
"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face.

As we drove away, I couldn't help but wonder what he had seen that I hadn't. Was it something in my eyes, a flicker of desperation or a glimmer of sadness? I glanced over at my friend, who was focused on the road, oblivious to my inner turmoil. I wanted to ask him what Jack had meant by that look, but something held me back. Maybe it was the fear of hearing something I didn't want to know, or maybe it was the fear of admitting to myself that I was indeed broken. Whatever the reason, I kept quiet, lost in my thoughts as the city lights blurred together outside the window. The rest of the drive was a haze, my mind consumed by the weight of Jack's pitying gaze. When we finally arrived at my place, I thanked my friend for the ride and stepped out into the cool night air, feeling like I was walking into a darkness that had nothing to do with the time of day."
"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.","lined the walls, and the scent of pumpkin spice wafted through the air.

I took him on hayrides and to corn mazes, and even convinced him to join me for a bonfire on a crisp October night. As the leaves changed colors and the air grew cooler, I could see the skepticism in Jack's eyes begin to fade, replaced by a sense of wonder and curiosity. He started to notice the little things, like the way the sunlight filtered through the trees, casting a warm glow over everything, and the sound of leaves crunching beneath our feet. And as the days turned into weeks, I could see Jack's heart slowly opening up to the magic of Autumn. He began to appreciate the coziness of the season, the way it made him feel all warm and fuzzy inside. And as we sat by the bonfire, watching the stars twinkle to life above, I knew that I had succeeded in my mission. Jack had finally come to see Autumn as I did - as a season of wonder, of magic, and of endless possibility."

On the last day of school before winter break, Jack finally said something. I cannot remember what I had been telling him, only that it had been about Autumn.","friends.

But as time went on, life had taken us in different directions, and we had slowly lost touch. I remembered the last time we spoke, it was brief and superficial, a mere exchange of pleasantries on social media. I couldn't help but feel that our friendship had become a relic of the past, a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era. And yet, a part of me still held on to the hope that we could rekindle what we once had, that our friendship was still a flame that could be fanned back to life. But for now, it remained a flicker, a distant memory that I couldn't quite grasp."
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah?

Jack hesitated, glancing around nervously before leaning in close. ""I saw something weird this morning,"" he whispered, his eyes darting back and forth. ""Something that's been bugging me ever since."" I felt a shiver run down my spine as I wondered what could have gotten Jack so spooked. ""What was it?"" I pressed, my curiosity piqued. Jack took a deep breath before launching into a hushed explanation, his words tumbling out in a rush. ""I was walking to school, and I saw Mrs. Johnson, our English teacher, arguing with someone in the parking lot. I couldn't see who it was, but they were going at it pretty heatedly. And then, just as I was about to walk by, Mrs. Johnson stormed off, leaving the other person standing there, looking...looking really angry."" Jack's eyes locked onto mine, his expression serious. ""I think it might have something to do with the school play auditions. I overheard some of the drama club kids talking about how Mrs. Johnson was being super unfair with the casting."" I raised an eyebrow, skeptical. ""That's not exactly news, Jack. Mrs. Johnson can be pretty tough when it comes to the play."" But Jack just shook his head. ""No, it's more than that.

""Alright, let's do some digging."" Little did we know, our investigation would lead us down a rabbit hole of secrets, lies, and surprises that would change our school year forever."

"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly.

I also made a conscious effort to stay hydrated, drinking plenty of water before, during, and after practice to ensure that my body was functioning at its best. As I worked on my coolness, I noticed a significant improvement in my game. I was able to run faster, jump higher, and react quicker, all without getting winded or overheated. My teammates took notice too, and soon they were coming to me for advice on how to stay cool under pressure. I was happy to share my newfound knowledge, and together we formed a formidable team, each of us bringing our unique skills and strengths to the field. We worked together seamlessly, like a well-oiled machine, and our hard work paid off as we won game after game.

We had done it – we were going to be teammates on the junior varsity team, and nothing could beat the thrill of that feeling. The rest of the day was a blur of congratulations from friends and family, and by the time we made it home, we were both beaming with pride, already counting down the days until our first game."

Nevertheless, I was grateful for the opportunity to lead the team and was determined to prove myself worthy of the responsibility. As the project progressed, I encountered numerous challenges, but I drew upon the experience of that initial meeting to navigate them. I learned to prioritize tasks effectively, delegate responsibilities, and communicate clearly with my team members. The project ultimately turned out to be a huge success, and I received accolades from my superiors and peers alike. Looking back, I realize that Jack's decision to make me team lead was a turning point in my career, one that taught me the value of resilience and effective leadership."

As the practices drew to a close, the teams began to wrap up their activities, gathering their gear and saying their goodbyes before heading off to their next classes or home. The fields, once bustling with activity, slowly emptied out, leaving behind only the faint scent of freshly cut grass and the distant hum of cars driving by on the nearby road."
"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me.

I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as I walked, the silence a stark contrast to the camaraderie I had witnessed among my teammates. I wondered if I would ever be able to break into their tight-knit group, or if I would always be the outsider looking in. As I turned the corner onto my street, I noticed a figure waiting on the porch of my house. It was my best friend, Alex, who had come over to hear all about my first practice. I quickened my pace, looking forward to finally having someone to talk to."

Jack nodded, his eyes still fixed on the ground, and we continued walking in silence. As we approached the south field, I could see the other guys already working, their faces sweaty and exhausted. I felt a pang of dread in my stomach, knowing that we had a long day of hard labor ahead of us. But as I glanced over at Jack, I saw a determined look in his eyes, and I knew that he was thinking the same thing I was - we had to find a way out of this place, no matter what it took."

Maybe she had sensed the depth of my feelings, the longing that I had been trying to keep hidden, even from myself. As I lay there, frozen in uncertainty, she might have been searching for answers, her mind racing with questions about the nature of our relationship and the future that lay ahead.

And in that moment, I knew that I had to find a way to bridge the gap between us, to break the silence and reveal the truth that had been locked away in my heart for so long."

She tries to take deep breaths, but her body is shaking with sobs. She can't believe he would say such hurtful things to her. She feels a lump form in her throat as she remembers the way he looked at her, his eyes cold and unfeeling. She buries her face in the pillow, letting the tears flow freely, and wonders how things had escalated so quickly."

We did kinda grow apart that year.”,as she finally found herself surrounded by people who accepted her quirks,25,"as she finally found herself surrounded by people who accepted her quirks and shared her passions, and for the first time in her life, she felt like she truly belonged. The feeling was almost surreal, like she had been living in a dream world where nothing made sense, and suddenly, everything clicked into place. She no longer felt the need to hide behind a mask of normalcy, and her true self began to shine through, like a ray of sunshine breaking through the clouds on a stormy day. The sense of liberation was exhilarating, and she reveled in the freedom to be herself, without fear of judgment or rejection."
“I don’t like him.” I shrugged. “I told you before: Autumn’s an old friend from when we were kids. Sucks that she,"likes such a show-off.” I shrugged again. Up ahead, Autumn and her friends were waiting at the crosswalk for the light to change.","ended up with him, but I don't think she's happy.

I've been trying to spend more time with her, hoping she'll eventually open up, but it's hard when he's always around. I've met him a few times, and like I said, I just don't like him. There's something about him that doesn't sit right with me. Maybe it's the way he looks at Autumn, like he owns her or something. Or maybe it's the way he talks down to her, like she's not smart enough to make her own decisions. Whatever it is, I know I don't trust him, and I wish Autumn could see that too."
My face must change because she smiles and clambers into my lap. We wrap our arms around each other and settle in.,"After a moment, she says, “You know, I never thought this would happen either. When Jack told me—” and then she stops.","The warmth of her body seeps into mine, and I feel a sense of calm wash over me. As we sit there, I gently stroke her hair,",44,"The warmth of her body seeps into mine, and I feel a sense of calm wash over me. As we sit there, I gently stroke her hair, and she nuzzles her head into the crook of my neck. The world outside recedes, and all that's left is the gentle rise and fall of our chests, the soft rustle of our breathing. In this quiet, intimate space, time stands still, and I am acutely aware of the preciousness of this moment, the beauty of this tiny, fragile human who has claimed my heart. As I hold her close, I feel a deep sense of gratitude for this little life, for the laughter and the tears, the triumphs and the struggles. And I know that I will do everything in my power to protect and nurture her, to help her grow and thrive, to be the safe haven she needs in a world that can sometimes be overwhelming and scary. In this moment, all is right with the world, and I am at peace."
"“Sorry,” I say. “I was trying to decide whether I should kill Jack for telling you I was",into you or if I should kill him for telling you that I wasn’t into you.

I take a deep breath and decide to just go with it. ""I guess the cat's out of the bag now,"" I say, trying to sound casual despite the turmoil brewing inside me. ""I've had feelings for you for a while now, but I didn't know how to tell you."" I pause, studying your reaction, hoping that you'll say something, anything, to let me know how you feel. The silence between us is deafening, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest as I wait for your response."
"“Yeah,” I admit. Jack was protecting me, but there’s no way he believed that I was over Autumn. I’m wondering now though. “What would","you have done if he’d told you the truth, that I was”—I try to remember how Jack put it before—“bonkers in love with you?”","you have done to make him think that?""

I rack my brain, trying to remember every conversation, every moment we shared since Autumn left. I feel a pang in my chest as I think about her, but it's not as sharp as it used to be. Maybe Jack was right, maybe I am over her. The thought sends a wave of uncertainty through me, and I look at Jack, searching for answers. He's watching me, his eyes filled with a mix of concern and curiosity. ""You really don't remember, do you?"" he asks, his voice low and gentle. I shake my head, feeling a sense of trepidation. What did I do? What did I say? And why can't I remember?"
"“I think my mother has a special bottle of champagne hidden away for just this occasion,” I say. I’m only partially joking. Mom has labeled some of her alcohol, like","for when George W.

My fiancé, Alex, chuckles and shakes his head, ""You know your mom too well."" He takes my hand, and we continue walking through the quiet streets, enjoying the peaceful evening air. The stars are shining brightly above us, and I feel like I'm on cloud nine. We've been together for five years, and I've known he was the one for me from the moment we met. I glance over at him, and he smiles, his eyes sparkling with happiness. I know he's thinking the same thing I am - that this is just the beginning of our new life together. We turn a corner, and our apartment building comes into view. I can see the lights on in the living room, and I know my mom is waiting up for us, eager to hear all about our engagement. I squeeze Alex's hand, and we quicken our pace, excited to share our news with the people we love."

She leans in, a sly smile spreading across her face, and begins to recount a list of things that I had no idea she knew about, let alone understood. As she speaks, I feel a growing sense of unease, wondering how she could possibly know all of this, and what else she might be hiding."

I can see her house up ahead, the porch light casting a warm glow over the front yard. I pull into the driveway, putting the car in park before turning to face her. “Come on, Syl, don’t be stubborn. Let me walk you to the door.”"

But then I hear her take a deep breath and launch into whatever crisis is currently plaguing her. I listen, still trying to shake off the remnants of sleep, as she talks a mile a minute about something that sounds vaguely familiar but doesn't quite register. I'm about to ask her to slow down when she drops a bombshell that makes my eyes snap open. ""Wait, what? You can't be serious,"" I say, suddenly wide awake and sitting up in bed."

I take a deep breath, trying to hold back the tears that are welling up in my eyes, and begin to walk towards the old oak tree where we used to play hide and seek. The tree's branches seem to stretch out like withered arms, as if mourning the loss of my dear friend. I reach out and touch the rough bark, feeling a sense of nostalgia wash over me. It's hard to believe that Finn is really gone, that I'll never see his bright smile or hear his infectious laugh again. The world seems emptier without him, and I'm left standing here, trying to make sense of it all."

"There’s an odd aura around us as we approach. I feel so young, like I’m being escorted into kindergarten, and I’m resentful and grateful all over again.

We're all in this together, and yet, I feel like I'm the only one who's truly aware of what's at stake. As we approach the entrance, a large wooden door with intricate carvings, I can feel a strange energy emanating from it. It's as if the door is alive, watching us, waiting for us to make our move. My parents push the door open, and we step inside, leaving the bright sunlight behind. The air inside is thick and heavy, and I can feel it pressing down on me. I look around, trying to take it all in, but everything is a blur. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be looking for, or what's supposed to happen next.

"“Uh-huh.” I take a gulp of coffee, which hasn’t quite cooled and burns down my throat. “So my guess is that’s what Sylv","said to you, and then you pushed back, because of course you did, and that’s when she said what you said to me, huh?”","an was trying to tell me, but I didn't quite catch it.

I let the beat take over, losing myself in the rhythm as I scan the room for a glimpse of Chloe's bright smile. She's always been the life of the party, and I have no doubt she's still got the same spark that drew me to her all those years ago. As I make my way through the crowd, I'm hit with a wave of nostalgia - the smell of cheap perfume and sweat, the taste of stale beer, the sound of laughter and music that seems to pulse through every cell in my body. It's like no time has passed at all, and yet, everything is different. I'm not the same awkward, gangly teenager I used to be, and I can only imagine the stories Chloe must have accumulated over the years. I finally spot her across the room, looking more radiant than ever, and my heart skips a beat as our eyes meet. For a moment, it's like we're back in high school, exchanging flirtatious glances and silly jokes, our whole lives stretching out before us like an endless highway. And then, just as quickly, the moment is gone, and we're two adults, standing in a crowded room, wondering what the other is doing here."

But the memory of my thoughtless words lingers, a nagging reminder of my own fallibility."

The photo shows him as a young man, with a mop of messy brown hair and a bright, cheeky grin. He's standing in front of a beach sunset, with the waves crashing against the shore behind him, and a surfboard tucked under his arm. It's a carefree, idyllic moment, frozen in time, and Brett often finds himself wondering what his younger self would think if he could see him now, sitting at his desk, staring at a computer screen all day."

So, I'll put on a smile, grab a plate of free food, and see what the night has in store."

It's nice to see him so carefree, especially after the way he used to mope around the dorm. I've tried to strike up a conversation with him a few times, but he just gives me a nod or a quick hello before returning to his friends. I'm not sure if he's still interested in talking to me, or if he's just too caught up in his new social circle. Either way, I'm happy to see him happy, and I'll just have to be content with our occasional brief encounters. Maybe someday we'll have a chance to catch up properly and I'll get to know this new, more outgoing Brett."

He was a huge fan of the series and had even imported a few of the Japanese games that weren't available in the US. We exchanged numbers, and he invited me to a gaming session at his place the following weekend. I accepted, and we parted ways when the elevator stopped on my floor. I didn't think much of it at the time, but that chance encounter would end up changing my life in ways I never could have imagined. Little did I know, this guy from Taiwan was not just any ordinary gamer, but a key player in a world of competitive gaming that I was about to enter. As I walked into my apartment, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and curiosity about what the future held."

The door clicks open, and I push it wide, calling out his name. There's no response, and for a moment, I wonder if I've made a mistake. But then I see him, sprawled out on the bed, fast asleep. A wave of relief washes over me, followed by a pang of guilt for waking him. I approach him quietly, not wanting to startle him, and gently shake his shoulder. He stirs, rubbing his eyes, and looks up at me with a mixture of confusion and sleepiness. ""Hey,"" he says, his voice husky from sleep. ""I didn't expect you back so soon."" I smile, feeling a little silly for my earlier anxiety, and sit down beside him on the bed. ""I know, I'm sorry. I just couldn't wait to see you."" He smiles back, and we sit there for a moment, just looking at each other, the tension between us palpable."

Luckily, after a few moments, she started to stir and eventually woke up, but it was a really frightening experience. After that, we made sure to check on her more frequently, especially during naptime, to make sure she was okay. It was a wake-up call for us as parents, and we were more vigilant about her sleep from then on.

But it's quickly replaced by panic as I realize I have no idea what to do next. I try to recall the basics - feeding, changing, burping - but it's all a blur. I look around the room again, this time searching for a phone or a way to call for help. That's when I see it - a small note on the kitchen counter with a phone number and a name: ""Lena"".

I felt like I was losing myself in the process, like I was disappearing into the void of our problems. I longed for the carefree days when our love was new and exciting, when every moment together was a thrill. But those days seemed like a distant memory now, a fleeting dream that had vanished into thin air. I was left with the harsh reality of our situation, and the nagging fear that we might not make it through this after all."

I tune him out, taking a sip of my water and glancing around the restaurant. It's a nice place, with white tablecloths and soft music, and I feel a sense of relaxation wash over me. Maybe this won't be so bad after all."

He couldn't help but wonder if this was a result of his own actions, if he had somehow inadvertently pushed her away. He thought back to the early days of their relationship, when they had been so in love, so full of hope and promise. What had changed? Had he become complacent, taken her for granted? The questions swirled in his mind, taunting him with their lack of answers. He sighed, feeling a sense of resignation wash over him. He knew he had to confront her, to talk to her about the way things were between them. But he was afraid, afraid of what she might say, afraid of losing her altogether.
