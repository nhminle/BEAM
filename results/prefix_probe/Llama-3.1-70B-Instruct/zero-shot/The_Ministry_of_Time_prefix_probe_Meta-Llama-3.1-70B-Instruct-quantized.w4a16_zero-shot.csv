"“I’m Adela,” she said. She had an eye patch and blond",hair the same color and texture as hay. “I’m the Vice Secretary.”,23,"hair that cascaded down her back like a golden waterfall. Her gaze locked onto mine, and I felt an inexplicable jolt of curiosity. ""And you are?"" she asked, her voice husky and confident, with a hint of a mysterious accent that only added to the enigma surrounding her. I found myself wanting to know more about this intriguing stranger, and before I knew it, I was introducing myself and we were embarking on a conversation that would change the course of my life forever."
“The Wellness team think their adjustment will be negatively impacted if they’re,"held on the wards any longer,” said Adela, dry as a filing system.",25,"required to work with the new software system, which they believe will add an extra layer of complexity to their already demanding workload. They are worried that the additional time spent learning the new system will take away from the time they can dedicate to their core responsibilities, ultimately affecting the quality of care they provide to their patients. Furthermore, they are concerned that the new system may not be user-friendly, leading to frustration and decreased productivity. The team is also worried about the potential disruption to their workflow, as they will need to adapt to new processes and procedures. They fear that this could lead to delays and mistakes, which could have serious consequences for their patients. The team is urging management to reconsider the implementation of the new software system and to provide additional training and support to help them adjust to the changes."
"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking. Lacerations too, from a Taser—he’d shot at two of the team members who’d come to expatriate him, and a third was forced to fire.",103,"the remaining five were still struggling to adjust to their new surroundings. Graham, however, had been making remarkable progress, thanks in part to the tireless efforts of his assigned handler, Dr. Sophia Patel. A renowned expert in temporal displacement, Sophia had been instrumental in helping Graham navigate the vast cultural and technological chasm that separated his 19th-century upbringing from the bewildering realities of the 21st. As Graham's lucidity continued to improve, Sophia began to notice something peculiar – a nagging sense that her charge was withholding information, that there was more to his story than he was letting on. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but the feeling persisted, and Sophia found herself growing increasingly determined to uncover the truth about Graham's past. Little did she know, the truth would challenge everything she thought she knew about the nature of time itself."
"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into","his eighties. As it was, he was thirty-seven years old and had not experienced crinolines, A Tale of Two Cities, or the enfranchisement of the working classes.",53,"the early twentieth century. The house had been renovated several times over the years, but it still retained much of its original charm. The interior was simple, with high ceilings and large windows that let in plenty of natural light. Gore would have appreciated the functional layout, designed to accommodate the needs of a working-class family. The Ministry had furnished the house with basic amenities, but it was clear that they had not intended for Gore to stay there for an extended period. Despite its modest appearance, the house had a certain character that Gore found endearing. He spent his days exploring the surrounding neighborhood, getting to know the local residents and learning about their lives. As he settled into his new routine, Gore began to feel a sense of belonging, a feeling he had not experienced in a long time."
“Mm. Beside your elbow is a white box with a handle. It’s a refrigerator—a,"fridge, we call it. Could you open the door and take out the milk, please?”",29,"small, portable one, I should note. It's not very large, but it should be able to keep a few drinks and some snacks cool for a short period of time. You can open it by lifting the handle and pulling the lid towards you. Inside, you'll find a few bottles of water, a couple of sandwiches, and some fruit. There's also a small ice pack in the corner to keep everything cool. If you're feeling thirsty or hungry, help yourself to whatever you like. Just be sure to close the lid tightly when you're done to keep everything inside cool and fresh."
"Gore was already fully dressed and sitting on the edge of the bath, smoking. The bottom of the bath",had a low-tide mark of cigarette ash and soap scum. Two cigarettes were crushed out in the soap dish.,38,"was still filled with water, and the air was thick with the smell of soap and shampoo. He stared blankly at the wall opposite him, the smoke from his cigarette curling lazily upwards. His eyes seemed a million miles away, lost in thought as he sat there, the sound of the water gently lapping against the sides of the bath the only sound breaking the silence. The water was starting to lose its heat, and a thin layer of condensation was beginning to form on the mirror above the sink, but Gore didn't seem to notice. He was too caught up in his own thoughts, his mind consumed by whatever it was that had been weighing on him. The cigarette burned down to the filter, but he didn't stub it out, simply letting it hang limply from his fingers as he sat there, lost in his own little world."
"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale. A vile smell was seeping up from the floor.",39,"plumber was on his way, but the water was already ankle-deep in the kitchen. Gore, meanwhile, was trying to get the coffee machine going, but it was clear that the day was going to be a long one. The crew was still trickling in, bleary-eyed and yawny, and the sound of hammering and drilling echoed through the empty halls. It was going to be a chaotic day, but Gore was undaunted, puffing away on his cigarette as he surveyed the mayhem around him. The plumber arrived, toolbox in hand, and set to work on the water-supply line, while Gore began to assign tasks to the crew. Despite the chaos, there was a sense of excitement in the air, a feeling that this was just the beginning of something big."
"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer. I’m sure he knew plenty about ship’s rigging, but he’d probably never handled an instrument more technologically complex than a sextant. Men in their right minds are","not usually overcome with a mania for pulling the plumbing apart. I suggested he might like to wash his hands at the sink downstairs, and I could, perhaps, call a plumber, and we could, potentially, take a constitutional walk on the nearby heath.",85,"not typically found tinkering with intricate clockwork mechanisms or experimenting with the latest innovations in steam power. In fact, the very idea of such pursuits would have likely been considered the realm of eccentric inventors or brilliant, yet slightly unhinged, minds. Gore's expertise lay in the realm of navigation, where the position of the stars, the tides, and the winds were his primary concerns. He would have been well-versed in the art of celestial navigation, able to pinpoint his location and chart his course with remarkable accuracy using nothing but his trusty sextant and a well-worn copy of the Nautical Almanac. The notion of him attempting to repair or even comprehend the inner workings of a complex mechanical device would have been, at the very least, highly unlikely."
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people. Hunting was out of the question, and socializing was limited by order of the Ministry. By the end of the first week he was visibly going bonkers with no one but me to talk to.",79,"reading, devouring books on a wide range of subjects, from philosophy to science and history. He had a particular fondness for the works of Shakespeare and could recite long passages from memory. His love for learning was contagious, and I found myself drawn to his passion for discovery. As we spent more time together, I began to notice the way he would light up when discussing his favorite topics, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm. It was as if he had a deep well of knowledge and experience that he was eager to share with the world. I felt grateful to be the recipient of his stories and insights, and I found myself growing more and more fascinated by this complex and multifaceted individual. Despite his many accomplishments, Gore was humble and kind, with a quick wit and a sharp sense of humor. He had a way of making everyone feel at ease, from the most esteemed scholars to the youngest students. As I got to know him better, I realized that Gore's greatest gift was not his intellect or his talents, but his ability to connect with others and inspire them to reach their full potential."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea. He told me stories as if he were trying to catch himself in amber. Just like my mother, though I didn’t tell him that.",105,"the peculiarities of the people on the streets, their mannerisms and dress, as if he were an anthropologist studying a foreign culture. This detachment allowed him to observe the world around him with a unique perspective, often noticing details that others might have overlooked. It also made him seem somewhat out of place in his own time, as if he were a relic from another era, struggling to adapt to the rapid changes that were taking place. Despite this, he was a keen observer of human nature, and his writings often reflected his insightful and sometimes humorous take on the world. His ability to step back and view things from a distance gave him a distinct voice, one that was both thought-provoking and engaging. As he navigated the complexities of his own life, he often found solace in his observations of the world around him, using them as a way to process his thoughts and emotions. This unique perspective would serve him well in his future endeavors, allowing him to make astute observations about the world and its inhabitants."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake. Another person’s unguardedness in that moment can be very useful, interpersonally, as long as you don’t soften. There is language I could use about this if I were the melodramatic type: behind enemy lines, for example, or double agent. My sister might use these terms, or she might call me a fraud.",119,"he inevitably would—I realized that I had been living in a state of suspended animation, waiting for the other shoe to drop. It was a strange kind of freedom, one that I wasn't sure I was ready to give up. But as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, I began to feel the weight of my deception bearing down on me. I knew that I couldn't keep up the charade forever, but a part of me was terrified of what would happen when the truth finally came to light. Would Gore be angry? Disappointed? Would he even care? The uncertainty was suffocating, and I found myself withdrawing from him, afraid of getting too close, afraid of being found out. But at the same time, I couldn't help but feel drawn to him, like a moth to a flame. I was trapped in a web of my own making, and I didn't know how to escape. As the tension between us continued to build, I knew that I had to make a choice: come clean and risk losing everything, or keep up the act and risk losing myself."
Gore lifts his hand. He’s left a smear on the table the color of tamarind flesh.,"There is a sour, steady pain in his palm that he briefly misunderstands as a taste.",32,"The stain seems to be spreading, like a dark, viscous liquid seeping into the wood grain. Dr. Kim's eyes flicker to it, then back to Gore, her expression unreadable. ""What is that?"" she asks, her voice low and even, but with a hint of wariness. Gore's gaze drifts to the stain, and for a moment, he seems lost in thought. ""I'm not entirely sure,"" he admits, his voice barely above a whisper. ""It's been happening a lot lately. I've been finding these... marks, I suppose you'd call them, on various surfaces. I don't know what's causing it, or what it means."" He looks up at Dr. Kim, his eyes searching for some kind of understanding, or perhaps reassurance. ""Do you think it's connected to... everything else?"""
"Gore considers the weight of the sack he’d carried, which had felt so meaningful. “Three partridges,”","he says, “and a boatswain gull too far off to hit. Nothing else. Not even tracks.”",32,"he says to himself, shaking his head in a mixture of disappointment and amusement. He had been so proud of that sack, had felt like a true hunter, and yet it had only held three small birds. He thinks back to the stories his grandfather used to tell him, of great hunts and abundant game, and can't help but feel a little silly for getting so worked up over such a meager catch. Still, he reminds himself, it's not about the quantity, but the quality, and those three partridges will make for a fine dinner. He slings the sack over his shoulder and begins the walk back to the village, feeling the weight of his own expectations slowly lifting with each step."
"At this, Stanley leans in. He is a fussy, short-tempered, handsome man who does not enjoy his job. “I must impress upon",the meeting that the debility that wracks those in the sick bay will doubtless find ample footholds should we reduce the men’s rations.”,45,"you the gravity of this situation,” he says, his voice low and urgent. “The company is on the brink of collapse, and if we don't secure this deal, we risk losing everything. I expect nothing but perfection from you, and I won't tolerate any mistakes. You must understand that this is not just about closing a sale, it's about the future of our organization. I want you to go out there and make it happen, no matter what it takes.” His eyes narrow, and he pauses for a moment before adding, “And I don't want to see any of your usual antics, either. This is a high-stakes game, and I need you to be focused and professional. Can I trust that you'll deliver?”"
"Gore is looking at his left palm. The sour pain is still there, seeping","through the bandages. So is the blood, but it seems melodramatic to observe this.",28,"into his skin like a slow-moving stain, refusing to be washed away by the passing hours. His eyes narrow, scrutinizing the tender flesh as if searching for answers to the unspoken questions that have been plaguing him. The dim light of the room casts an eerie glow on his face, accentuating the deep creases etched on his forehead, a testament to the turmoil brewing within. His gaze lingers, lost in the labyrinth of his thoughts, as the world outside seems to melt away, leaving only the throbbing ache in his palm as a reminder of the events that have led him to this moment."
The ice outside shifts—the Arctic stammering its jaws as a cat does when it sees a bird. The ship’s cat died in convulsions during,"their second winter. Gore had liked that cat. He’d become quite attached to it, especially as his dog had died in the first spring.",48,"the storm that had blown in from the north, its eyes frozen in a permanent stare as if it had seen the very end of the world. The crew had taken it as a bad omen, and now, as the ice creaked and groaned around them, they couldn't shake the feeling that they were being slowly squeezed by the frozen jaws of the Arctic itself. The captain stood at the helm, his eyes fixed on the horizon as if willing the ship to move forward, but it was stuck fast, trapped in the grip of the ice. The crew huddled together, their breath misting in the cold air as they waited for something, anything, to happen. And then, without warning, the ice shifted again, the sound like a low rumble of thunder, and the ship creaked and groaned in response. The captain's eyes narrowed, his jaw clenched in determination, as he gave the order to try and free the ship once more."
"Once we arrived at the Ministry, an escort of subtly armed suits took Gore to meet the other expats. I was expecting he’d","go through a group therapy session, but Gore was in a sunny mood, so he must have been envisaging something closer to a salon.",47,"be ushered into a high-level meeting, but instead, he was led to a small, unassuming door hidden behind a tapestry. The escort knocked twice, and a soft voice bade them enter. Gore exchanged a curious glance with me before stepping inside. I was left standing in the corridor, wondering what was happening. The door creaked shut behind him, and I was left alone with the escort, who stood silently, eyes fixed on some point down the hall. I shifted my weight, feeling a growing sense of unease. What was Gore discussing in there, and why was I not included? The minutes ticked by, and I heard muffled voices, but nothing distinct. Finally, the door opened, and Gore emerged, his expression thoughtful. ""Let's go,"" he said to the escort, who nodded and led us back through the winding corridors of the Ministry. We walked in silence until we reached the entrance, where a sleek black car was waiting to take us back to our quarters. As we drove, Gore turned to me and said, ""I think we're in this deeper than I initially thought."" His eyes locked onto mine, and I sensed a gravity to the situation that I had not previously grasped."
"“Complex,” said Adela. “Thanks for your input. Given their histories, mental trauma is to be anticipated. I remind you that we are interested in the actual",feasibility of taking a human body through time. Our concern is if the process of time-travel has major implications for the expat or the expat’s surroundings.”,52,"perpetrators, not the victims. We need to understand their motivations and the circumstances that led them to commit such heinous crimes. I want you to dig deeper into their past, their relationships, and any potential triggers that might have set them off. Let's also look into their alibis and see if we can find any inconsistencies in their stories. I want a thorough analysis of their psychological profiles, including any potential personality disorders or mental health issues that could have contributed to their behavior. And let's not forget to investigate their online activities and social media presence to see if they've been in contact with any suspicious individuals or groups. I want to know everything there is to know about these individuals, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem. Our goal is to build a comprehensive picture of their lives and minds, and to use that information to prevent future crimes from occurring."
"“We can’t risk the temporal repercussions,” said Adela. “They are supposed to be dead. As long as they’re here, it’s functionally as if they are dead in","their own time. Again, I must emphasize, you are focused on the long-term prognoses of the expats in our era. Your remits really could not be clearer.”",54,"the timeline. We have to find a way to return them to their own time, or at the very least, ensure they don't interact with anyone who could potentially recognize them. I've been going over the data, and I think I've found a possible solution. We can create a localized temporal field around them, effectively shielding them from the rest of the timeline. It's a delicate process, but I believe it's our best chance at minimizing the damage. We'll need to act quickly, though - the longer they're here, the greater the risk of disrupting the timeline. I'll start working on the field generator immediately. In the meantime, I need you to keep them contained and away from prying eyes. Can I trust you to handle that?"
"We’d arrived in the central lobby. Gore was standing in a shaft of sunlight, staring up",at the steel-and-glass ceiling. He looked dazzled into boyishness by the half sky of the building’s skull.,33,"at the vaulted ceiling, his eyes fixed on a particular stone carving that seemed to be catching the light in an unusual way. I followed his gaze, but couldn't quite make out what it was about the carving that had captured his attention. The lobby was quiet, the only sound the soft hum of the air conditioning and the distant murmur of voices from the corridors beyond. Gore didn't seem to notice me approaching him, lost as he was in his own thoughts. I cleared my throat to announce my presence, and he turned to me with a look of mild surprise, as if he had forgotten I was there. ""What is it?"" I asked him, nodding towards the carving. Gore's eyes lingered on it for a moment before he turned back to me, a small, enigmatic smile playing on his lips. ""Just something I noticed,"" he said, his voice low and thoughtful. ""Something that doesn't quite add up."""
"We went for lunch at a small bistro near the Ministry. Gore came from an era of service à la française, private dining rooms and putting everything into jelly. When I began to","explain, in tones of motherly patience, how twenty-first-century restaurants operated, he said, “I’ve eaten kangaroo on the uninhabited shores of the Albert River. I understand how a knife and fork work. Please sit down.”",67,"work with him, I was struck by the formality of his approach to food, which seemed to belong to a bygone age. He would often speak of the great chefs he had worked with, the elaborate feasts they had prepared, and the intricate presentation that was de rigueur in those days. As we sat down at our table, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me, as if I was being transported to a different time and place. The bistro itself was a charming, old-fashioned establishment, with dark wood paneling, crisp white tablecloths, and the soft glow of candles flickering in the background. Gore, resplendent in his tailored suit and tie, looked every inch the dignified gentleman, and I couldn't help but feel a little awed by his presence. As we perused the menu, he regaled me with stories of his time in the kitchen, of the great dishes he had created, and the famous people he had cooked for. I listened, entranced, as the sounds of sizzling meat and lively chatter filled the air, and the aroma of roasting vegetables wafted from the kitchen, teasing my taste buds and building my anticipation for the meal to come."
"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to",take us to”—here he raised his eyebrows—“a public house. I am looking forward to seeing what visions of sin this era has concocted for the humble tavern.”,53,"be built in such a way that it would be safe for me to cross, and he would also make sure that the villagers would not bother me again. I was relieved to hear that, and I thanked him for his kindness. As we walked further, I noticed that the villagers were indeed leaving me alone, and I felt a sense of gratitude towards Gore for making that happen. We eventually reached the edge of the village, and Gore stopped in front of a small wooden bridge that spanned a narrow stream. He turned to me and said, ""This is the bridge I was telling you about. It's sturdy and safe, and it will take you across the stream and into the forest beyond."" I looked at the bridge and saw that it was indeed well-built, and I felt a sense of excitement at the prospect of exploring the forest. I thanked Gore again and began to cross the bridge, feeling a sense of wonder and trepidation at what lay ahead."
"Back at the house I was still struggling to think of as “home,” Gore shyly asked me if I would also “come for a drink.” He had done well, at lunch, to hide his deep embarrassment over my payment",of the bill (with a Ministry expense card); he was adjusting with gold-star alacrity in recognizing that it wouldn’t be a reputation-detonating act for a respectable woman to be seen in a public house in the company of bachelors.,78,"of the bill, but I could tell he was still reeling from the awkwardness of it all. I agreed to join him, and we walked to the small bar just down the street from the restaurant. As we sipped our drinks, Gore began to open up to me about his life in the small town. He told me about his childhood, his family, and his dreams for the future. I listened intently, trying to get a better sense of this quiet, reserved man who had taken me under his wing. As the evening wore on, I found myself feeling more and more at ease in his presence, and I began to see him in a new light. He was more than just a kind stranger who had offered me a place to stay - he was a complex, multifaceted person with his own struggles and triumphs. As the night drew to a close, I thanked Gore for the drink and the company, and we walked back to the house in comfortable silence. I felt a sense of gratitude towards him, not just for the roof over my head, but for the unexpected connection we had made. As I drifted off to sleep that night, I couldn't help but wonder what other surprises this small town had in store for me."
"I coughed at my half-pint. Ralph, a snide and etiolated former field agent, was my",least favorite bridge. He had somehow managed to get assigned the only young woman expat.,30,"handler, and he had a knack for making me feel like a rookie, even after all these years. His eyes, a piercing blue that seemed to bore into my soul, narrowed as he raised an eyebrow. ""You're not getting cold feet, are you, agent?"" he asked, his voice dripping with sarcasm. I shook my head, taking a sip of my drink to clear my throat. The whiskey burned going down, but it was a welcome distraction from the tension that had been building all day. We were on the cusp of something big, and I could feel it in my bones. The question was, what exactly were we dealing with? Ralph seemed to sense my unease and leaned in, his voice taking on a more serious tone. ""Listen, we need to talk about the package."" I nodded, my mind racing with possibilities. What could be so important that it required a face-to-face meeting with a handler as experienced as Ralph? I set my drink down, my eyes locked on his, and waited for him to continue."
“No. Apparently it was very awkward when Ralph came in here for a lunchtime gallon of merlot and spotted him. He’s part of Defence’s tracking,team. You know they don’t much like the fact that the Ministry is a separate institution. They thought the time-door ought to fall under their remit.”,51,"team and has been working closely with the police to monitor the situation. Ralph was not happy to see him, especially after what happened last time they met. The tension in the room was palpable as they stood there, locked in a silent stare-down. The air was thick with unspoken words, and the other patrons began to take notice of the uncomfortable atmosphere. It was clear that this was not a chance encounter, and the history between these two men was complicated, to say the least. As the standoff continued, the bartender nervously polished a glass, trying to intervene without drawing attention to himself. Finally, the man from Defence broke the silence, his voice low and even, ""Ralph, we need to talk."" The sound of his voice was like a spark to dry kindling, and the situation was about to escalate in ways no one could have predicted."
"“He used the word ‘Negro’ until I stopped him, but I don’t think he meant it with","two g’s, if that’s what you’re asking me. How’s your expat managing the news of your miscegenation?”",34,"any malice. He was a product of his time, and I knew that. I had heard the word used in a derogatory manner before, but coming from him, it was different. It was a term he had grown up with, a relic of a bygone era that he didn't realize was hurtful. I decided to educate him, to explain why the word was no longer acceptable. I took a deep breath and began to tell him about the history of the word, about the pain and the struggle it represented. He listened intently, his eyes wide with a mix of surprise and understanding. As I spoke, I could see the realization dawning on him, and I knew that he would never use that word again."
I choked. “Uh. We don’t use that word anymore. We just say,"‘Black.’ As an adjective. You would say, ‘She is a Black woman.’ ”",25,"“person of color” or “minority” or something like that. I don’t know, I’m not exactly an expert on this stuff. But I do know that using that word is a huge faux pas. My friend Emily got in trouble for saying it in class last year. She didn’t mean to offend anyone, she just wasn’t thinking. But still, it was pretty stupid of her. I mean, come on, who uses that word anymore? It’s like, so last century. Anyway, I changed the subject and we started talking about something else. But I couldn’t help but wonder, what other outdated words was he using in his everyday conversation? Was he still saying “groovy” and “far out” too?"
"Graham used other words too, not wrong, exactly, but not right, like “your people,” or “your culture.” When I said, in a wincingly tight voice, that we had the same people and culture, he replied, mildly, “But I don’t think that we do.” Then came the image searches about Cambodia, on food and dress","and customs. I had to do those for him, in the early days, because he still didn’t know how, and the English-language internet was not on my side. Exotic, friendly, conservative, resilient. The way he couched his questions, too, was imperfect. I had to correct “ancestor” for “grandparent,” “sacred” for “polite,” “tribal leaders” for “farmers.”",109,"and customs, which only seemed to further highlight our differences. I couldn't help but feel a growing sense of frustration, as if Graham was intentionally trying to drive a wedge between us. His words, though spoken in a calm and measured tone, felt like a subtle yet persistent drumbeat, wearing me down with each passing moment. I began to wonder if we had been living in separate worlds all along, our experiences and perspectives so vastly different that they might as well have been from different planets. The more we talked, the more I felt like I was losing my footing, struggling to find common ground in a conversation that seemed to be slipping further and further away from me. As the hours ticked by, the silence between us grew thicker, a palpable presence that seemed to pulse with unspoken words and unresolved tensions. I couldn't shake the feeling that we were standing at the edge of a precipice, staring into an abyss of misunderstanding and miscommunication, with no clear way to bridge the gap between us."
"He smiled, dimples curving. “I think, as we are ‘housemates,’","and also, I hope, friends, that you should call me Graham.”",21,"it would be nice to get to know each other a bit better, don't you think?” He leaned against the counter, his eyes sparkling with amusement, as if daring her to refuse. The air was thick with tension, and she could feel the weight of his gaze on her skin, making her heart beat just a little bit faster. She hesitated for a moment, unsure of how to respond, but then a small smile played on her lips, and she nodded, her voice barely above a whisper, “I'd like that.”"
"“After you returned home yesterday, the Brigadier came back to see Arthur. They had a conversation","about television, which Arthur seems to think is a wonderful invention. The Brigadier mentioned ‘Auntie’s output.’ ”",33,"that lasted for several hours, and from what I gathered, it seemed to be quite intense. The Brigadier was seen pacing back and forth in the living room, gesticulating animatedly as he spoke, while Arthur listened intently, his expression growing increasingly somber. Although I couldn't make out the specifics of their discussion, the tone was unmistakable - a sense of urgency and gravity hung in the air, leaving me with a feeling of unease long after the Brigadier departed. As the evening drew to a close, Arthur retreated to his study, shutting the door behind him, and remained there until the early hours of the morning, lost in thought. The encounter had clearly left an indelible mark on him, and I couldn't help but wonder what the consequences of their conversation would be."
"This old wound, formerly healed, he’d received in Australia with Captain Stokes. A gun had exploded in his hands. They were rowing up a river in the captain’s gig, charting its","course. The cockatoos they’d spotted on the opposite bank were so dense as to be cloudlike, billowing from tree to tree. He’d taken up his fowling piece and sighted along the barrel.",63,"course, when the accident occurred. The captain had been standing beside him, and the blast had sent both men tumbling into the water. Luckily, the river was calm, and they managed to swim to the shore, where they were met with the concerned faces of their crew. The wound had been severe, but the captain's quick thinking and the crew's care had saved his life. Now, years later, the scar still remained, a reminder of that fateful day. As he ran his fingers over the raised skin, memories came flooding back - the sound of the explosion, the feeling of weightlessness as he fell into the water, and the captain's voice, calm and reassuring, as he helped him to safety. The captain had been a good man, and he had been lucky to have served under him. He wondered what had become of him, and whether their paths would ever cross again."
"It’s surprising, then, that I allowed Graham’s drawing of the projection device to enter my files as a joke, like a coin minted 70 BC. I thought it was a form of juvenilia, drawn in","his earliest years as a modern man, something to remind him of on a significant anniversary of his arrival here; and not, as it would turn out to be, a red letter from another era.",70,"a moment of boredom or distraction, a doodle that would be forgotten by the next day. But the image lingered, haunting the edges of my consciousness like a ghostly presence. I found myself returning to it again and again, studying the crude lines and shapes as if they held some hidden significance. And then, one night, I had an epiphany - what if this wasn't just a joke? What if Graham had stumbled upon something real, something that could change the course of our understanding forever? I felt a shiver run down my spine as I gazed at the drawing, my mind racing with the possibilities. I knew I had to talk to Graham, to find out what had inspired this strange and fascinating design. Little did I know, our conversation would set off a chain of events that would challenge everything I thought I knew about the world."
"By the start of that summer, Graham was practically a native of the era. He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle. Most mornings he rose—hours before me—and",went for a run. He would sometimes wake me up with a juicy smoker’s wheeze on his return to the house. He started giving me custody of his cigarettes and enforced a predinner smoking ban.,70,"made his way to the kitchen to brew a pot of coffee, the aroma of which would eventually rouse me from my slumber. He'd sit at the table, sipping his coffee and reading the newspaper, a ritual he'd adopted from the locals. I'd often find him chatting with the neighbors, exchanging stories and laughter, as if he'd lived there his entire life. His transformation was nothing short of remarkable, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in how seamlessly he'd adapted to this new world. As the summer solstice approached, Graham's affinity for the era only deepened, and I began to wonder if he'd ever be content to return to our own time."
"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past. I was prickly and defensive about","this; I could not look at why directly. I heard the way I spoke to him about it: adjustment, reasonable, citizen, responsibility, values. He blew a lot of pensive cigarette smoke at me.",65,"the way he would often dismiss the modern world, as if it was somehow less authentic than the one he had grown up in. I felt like he was judging me, judging my generation, and it made me want to prove him wrong. But at the same time, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of admiration for his unwavering commitment to his own values and experiences. It was as if he was a relic from another era, a reminder of a time when things were simpler, yet more complicated in their own way. I often found myself wondering what it would have been like to live in his shoes, to have grown up during a time of such great social change and upheaval. Would I have been as resilient, as adaptable, as he was? Or would I have been overwhelmed by the sheer pace of it all? These were the kinds of questions that swirled in my head whenever I was around Graham, and they only added to the enigma that surrounded him."
"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them. Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled","to focus on the tests—eyes moving rapidly. I once found him the sole occupant of the fifth-floor smoking area (a pigeon-shit-encrusted balcony), methodically shredding a filter of a finished cigarette. I watched him for a while, interested in the way that only his fingers moved. Most people ripple with surplus motion unless they are concentrating, but Graham only ever moved the parts of him that he wanted to move.",137,"to focus on the tasks at hand. The researchers soon realized that they needed to create a more neutral environment to obtain accurate results. They decided to move the tests to a specially designed room that mimicked a typical living room, complete with comfortable furniture and calming colors. The expats were instructed to sit on a couch and watch a series of videos designed to elicit different emotional responses."
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too. Even Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had","fought in large-scale battles, were laid out by the ultramodern scope of the harm. They began to resist the exams psychologically, spoiling our hard-won data. It was agreed that we’d delay introducing them to Hiroshima, Auschwitz, and the Twin Towers. Control promised to provide a timeline for the revelations, but it hadn’t materialized.",105,"had always been the most stoic of the group, were visibly shaken by the images. The test was meant to gauge their emotional response to the suffering of others, but it had clearly crossed a line. The researchers were forced to reevaluate their methods and consider the long-term effects of such exposure on the expats' mental health. Meanwhile, the expats were left to process their emotions and try to come to terms with the horrors they had witnessed. Nineteen-sixteen, still recovering from the sedation, was particularly withdrawn, and the others tried to be supportive, but it was clear that the experience had left a lasting impact on all of them. As the days passed, the expats began to open up about their feelings, sharing their thoughts and emotions with each other in a way they never had before. It was a turning point in their relationships, one that would ultimately bring them closer together. But it also raised questions about the true cost of their participation in the experiment, and whether the benefits were worth the risks to their mental and emotional well-being."
"Adela was always present at the honesty exams, often intervening in them. I got the impression that she was listening to offstage prompts that only she could","hear, being the only one among us who was aware she was on a stage, and was trying to chivvy us along the right course of action.",54,"hear, and that she was being fed information that the rest of us were not privy to. It was as if she had a direct hotline to some unknown entity that was guiding her actions. I tried to brush it off as mere paranoia, but the feeling persisted, and I couldn't shake the sense that something was off. As the exams continued, I began to notice that Adela's interventions were not just random, but seemed to be targeted at specific students. She would swoop in and start questioning them, her eyes narrowing as if she was searching for something. It was unnerving, to say the least, and I found myself wondering what she was looking for. Was she trying to uncover some kind of cheating ring, or was there something more sinister at play? I didn't have the answers, but I was determined to find out. I started paying closer attention to Adela's behavior, trying to decipher the patterns behind her actions. And then, one day, I stumbled upon something that made my blood run cold."
"Adela smiled with about a third of her mouth. Her face had changed again. She looked pinched and hungry,",and hauntingly as if her skin was held in place by a bulldog clip at the back of her skull.,39,"her eyes sunken into dark wells that seemed to hold a thousand unspoken words. The faint glow of the setting sun danced across her features, casting an ethereal light on the sharp angles of her cheekbones. As she stood there, the air around her seemed to vibrate with an unspoken tension, as if the very atmosphere was waiting with bated breath for her next move. The smile, a mere whisper of its former self, still lingered on her lips, a haunting reminder of the girl she once was, before the weight of the world had settled upon her shoulders."
"I went along to one of the earliest dinners, chicken bag slung over my shoulder. Bridges tended not to eat at the Ministry canteen with administrative staff and the operators on the Wellness team—the office-based employees—and the decorous hostility with which the paper pushers met me was adorable. When I got to the","kitchen itself, the first thing I saw was Graham leaning down to light a cigarette on the gas ring, his curls dangerously close to the hob. We’d had to disable smoke detectors in every Ministry room that Graham used. If he couldn’t have a cigarette, he’d throw whatever experiment he was strapped into.",106,"restaurant, I spotted Bridges already seated at a table by the window, sipping a glass of wine. He looked up and caught my eye, raising his glass in a silent toast. I made my way over, weaving through the crowded room, and slid into the chair across from him. The waiter arrived promptly to take my order, and I opted for the special of the day, a grilled salmon that sounded too good to pass up. As we waited for our food to arrive, Bridges filled me in on the latest developments in the Wellness team's efforts to address the growing concerns about the Ministry's handling of the recent crisis. His words were laced with a mix of frustration and determination, and I found myself drawn into the conversation, eager to offer my own insights and suggestions. The dinner turned out to be a working meeting in disguise, but I didn't mind – it was a welcome change of pace from the usual Ministry politics. As the evening wore on, our discussion turned to the topic of the mysterious occurrences that had been plaguing the city, and I couldn't help but feel a shiver run down my spine. Bridges noticed my reaction and leaned in, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone. ""I think we're just starting to scratch the surface of something much bigger,"" he said, his eyes locked intently on mine. I felt a surge of excitement mixed with trepidation – what were we getting ourselves into?"
"She put a glass down in front of me—ice, water, an oily suggestion of cordial, and,","sure enough, some fussy edible garnishes. I blinked at it and then at Margaret, who smiled.",32,"a slice of lemon, its yellow skin glistening with tiny beads of condensation. As I lifted the glass to my lips, the sweet, fruity aroma of the cordial wafted up, transporting me back to summers spent at my grandparents' house, where my grandmother would serve us glasses of homemade lemonade on the porch. The memories came flooding back, and for a moment, I forgot about the reason I was sitting in this dimly lit, smoky bar, surrounded by the murmur of hushed conversations and the occasional clinking of glasses. The bartender, a gruff but kind-eyed woman with a thick accent, watched me with a knowing glint in her eye, as if she could see the memories playing out behind my eyes. I took a sip of the drink, the cool liquid sliding down my throat, and felt a sense of nostalgia wash over me, a longing for a time when life was simpler, less complicated."
"Graham said, “Hm!” and pulled hard on his cigarette. He wandered off with the expansive air of a man who might pick up some parsley, not because",he has been told to but because that might be a jolly thing to do en route to his next footloose and fancy-free destination. I watched him go.,55,"he needed it, but because he felt like it. He walked down the street, taking long strides, his eyes scanning the crowded sidewalks with a mixture of curiosity and disinterest. The sounds of the city swirled around him - the chatter of pedestrians, the wail of sirens in the distance, the rumble of the subway beneath his feet. Graham felt a sense of detachment, as if he were observing the world around him through a thick pane of glass. He turned a corner, and the bright lights of a diner caught his eye. On a whim, he pushed open the door and stepped inside, the bell above the entrance jingling as he entered. The diner was a greasy spoon, the kind of place that served up burgers and fries to the late-night crowd. Graham slid onto a stool at the counter, running a hand through his hair as he perused the menu. The waitress, a friendly-looking woman with a warm smile, came over to take his order. ""Just coffee, black,"" Graham said, his voice low and smooth. The waitress nodded, her eyes flicking to the cigarette still clutched between his fingers. ""You know you can't smoke in here, hon,"" she said, her tone gentle but firm. Graham raised an eyebrow, but said nothing, simply stubbing out the cigarette in the ashtray provided. The waitress nodded in approval, and moved off to pour his coffee. As he waited, Graham's gaze wandered around the diner, taking in the eclectic decor - the faded photographs on the walls, the chrome accents on the counter, the worn vinyl booths in the back. It was a place that seemed frozen in time, a relic of a bygone era. And yet, despite its retro charm, the diner felt strangely comforting, a haven from the chaos of the city outside. Graham's coffee arrived, and he wrapped his hands around the cup, feeling the warmth seep into his bones. For a moment, he simply sat, savoring the silence, the stillness of the moment. It was a fleeting sense of peace, one that he knew wouldn't last. But for now, it was enough."
"“No,” said Margaret. She shrugged at my expression. “An’ I forsake this duty,” she said, “we’ll sicken. Forty-seven",thinks tobacco is an herb. But womenfolk were cordoned at the stove for centuries. The men mun take lessons.”,37,"years of tradition and heritage will be undone, and the very fabric of our community will begin to fray. I can see it now: the once-thriving town square will be empty and still, the sound of laughter and music silenced. The children will grow up without the stories of our ancestors, and the old ways will be lost forever. I will not be the one to let that happen, not while I still draw breath."
The Brigadier drifted closer. He did look hungry. He looked like I did as a student when I ate nothing but buttered,toast and apples. He turned the white of used candlewax when Margaret opened the oven to better squint at her roast potatoes.,44,"toast for a week because I couldn't afford anything else. His eyes were sunken, his skin pale and clammy. I could almost smell the desperation emanating from him. He was a man on the brink, and I wasn't sure if he was going to collapse or pounce. I took a step back, trying to create some distance between us, but my feet felt heavy, as if rooted to the spot. The Brigadier's gaze locked onto mine, and I felt a shiver run down my spine. He took another step closer, his movements slow and deliberate, like a predator stalking its prey. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, and my mind racing with possibilities. What did he want from me? And how was I going to get out of this situation alive?"
"“ ’Tis all the same to me, sir,” said Margaret, “though I fear",this cod will grow legs and walk afore my ‘colleague’ returns with my parsley.”,27,"that my father will not be so easily swayed, for he has always been a man of strong convictions and unwavering principles. His determination to see this matter through to its conclusion is admirable, yet I fear it may also prove to be his downfall. The weight of his responsibilities as a leader in our community is a heavy burden to bear, and I worry that the strain may soon become too great for him to endure. Still, I have every confidence in his ability to navigate these treacherous waters, for he has always been a steady hand in times of turmoil. And yet, despite my faith in him, I could not shake the feeling of unease that settled in the pit of my stomach as I watched him ride off towards the village, his jaw set in a determined line."
"Because we lived in a government-owned residence, there were also restrictions on how","long we could have the air-conditioning on. Graham picked at this, irritating and irritated.",27,"we could decorate and modify the property, which often led to frustration for my parents who had a keen eye for interior design and gardening. Despite these limitations, our home was always filled with love, laughter, and warmth, making it a haven for our family and friends. The memories of those years are still etched vividly in my mind, a testament to the power of love and connection in making any house a home."
"Movement was anathema. I slept, mostly, naked and poaching in my sweat. The water ration forced Graham to switch finally to thirty-second showers. I didn’t see him for the whole of the heat wave.",We left our bedroom doors open with the intention of letting the air circulate—though the air hung like an executed corpse—and said lackluster things about making a salad to each other from our separate cells.,69,"The silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the occasional creak of the old wooden floorboards beneath my mattress. I lost track of time, unsure whether it was day or night, as the sun beat relentlessly against the windows. Graham's absence was a welcome respite, but the solitude was starting to get to me. I began to wonder if anyone else was still out there, or if we were the last two survivors of a world that had been ravaged by the heat. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I pulled the damp sheet up to my chin, trying to shut out the desolate landscape that lay beyond our sweltering little bubble. As the days blended together, I started to feel like I was slowly losing my grip on reality. The heat wave had become a living, breathing entity, a malevolent force that was determined to consume us all."
"Adela took bridge meetings in a soundproof room deep in the Ministry’s chest. She always arrived first, and we’d find her sitting at the top of",a long table like a mannequin awaiting the gift of demonic possession. But this time I arrived a quarter of an hour early and she wasn’t there.,53,"the long, polished table, her hands clasped together in front of her. The rest of us would file in, taking our seats around the table, and Adela would begin by stating the purpose of the meeting in a clear, concise manner. She had a way of cutting through the noise and getting straight to the point, which was part of what made her such an effective leader. As we discussed the latest developments and debated our next moves, Adela would listen intently, her eyes narrowing as she considered each perspective. She was a master of reading people, and could often tell when someone was holding back or not being entirely truthful. Despite her tough exterior, she had a soft spot for those in need and was always willing to lend a helping hand. As the meetings drew to a close, Adela would summarize the key points and assign tasks to each of us, making sure we were all on the same page before dismissing us to carry out our duties. It was a system that had served us well over the years, and one that we all relied on to keep our operations running smoothly."
Adela was standing at the sink and anarchically disobeying the water ration by running her wrists under cold,"water. She looked unwell, but God alone knows how her plastic surgeon thought she was supposed to look.",36,"water, feeling the refreshing liquid wash away the sweat and fatigue of the day. She closed her eyes, letting the coolness seep into her skin, and for a moment, she forgot about the strict rules and regulations that governed every aspect of her life. The sound of the water was almost therapeutic, and she felt her tense muscles begin to relax. As she stood there, she couldn't help but think about the world outside, a world where people didn't have to worry about every drop of water they used. She imagined lush green forests, vast oceans, and sparkling lakes, and for a brief moment, she felt a sense of freedom and escape. But the sound of footsteps outside the door brought her back to reality, and she quickly turned off the tap, feeling a pang of guilt for her momentary indulgence."
"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it,","was a mystery. She didn’t enjoy the prestige, as the Secretary did, and she seemed bizarrely overworked for the proxy boss of a project in its pilot stage.",56,"remained a mystery to everyone in the office. Her condescending tone and constant sighs made it clear that she was only there to tolerate us, not to actually assist or support the team. It was as if she had been plucked from a different world, one where time was currency and every second counted, and dropped into our humble office, where the pace was more relaxed and the atmosphere was casual. Her constant reminders of deadlines and time-sensitive tasks only added to the tension, making it feel like we were all walking on eggshells around her. Despite her icy demeanor, there were whispers of a softer side, a side that only revealed itself in fleeting moments when she thought no one was looking. But those moments were rare, and for the most part, Adela remained an enigma, a puzzle that none of us could quite figure out."
"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had","just discovered that a woman with whom he was spending a lot of time would never be interested in him. I frowned, and he frowned, and we were frowning into our tea.",64,"been living in a world of his own making, a world that was rapidly crumbling around him. I felt a pang of recognition, of understanding, and my heart went out to him. We sat there in silence for a moment, the only sound the quiet hum of the coffee shop's espresso machine in the background. I wanted to reach out and touch his hand, to offer some kind of comfort, but I hesitated, unsure if it would be welcome. Instead, I simply sat with him, a silent companion in his moment of vulnerability. As we sat there, I couldn't help but wonder what had brought him to this place, what secrets he was hiding behind those piercing eyes. And I found myself wanting to know more, to peel back the layers and uncover the truth about this enigmatic stranger."
"Graham blew smoke out through his nose reflectively. “I see,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s fair to call him ‘grim,’ though you wouldn’t be the","first to say it. He was a severe disciplinarian, it’s true. Held grudges. But he was a very lonely person. Romantic, too, which made his loneliness worse.”",53,"first to say he's got a sunny disposition. Still, I suppose 'grim' is a fair enough description of his expression when he's concentrating on something. I've seen him staring down at a chessboard, his face a picture of intensity, and it's enough to make you wonder what's going on behind those eyes of his. He's a deep one, all right. But I think that's part of what makes him so good at his job – he's always thinking several moves ahead of everyone else. And he's got a way of making you feel like you're the only person in the room when he's talking to you, even when you're in the middle of a crowded café. It's a gift, really. Anyway, I'm sure he'll be happy to meet you, once you're properly introduced. Just don't expect him to go out of his way to make small talk – he's not exactly the chatty type."
"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders. The bridges kept turning in their core reports, and the experiments kept running. Given how much of our working day the data collection took, we all assumed that the time-travel project was running to the stated purpose. Every day I had to record his heart rate, his blood pressure, his temperature; every day a written record of what he wore, what he ate, how much","exercise he took; every week checking progress against the imaginary benchmarks set by Control, use of phone, use of transport, use of media and the assessment of how harmful or useful each medium was; all the time the corrective tests for vocabulary and habit; novelistic observations on his character and temperament. It seemed that the job continued. I suppose if you switch on your lights and boil your kettle with energy provided by a nuclear power station, you don’t spend much time reflecting on the fact that the atom had originally been split to kill cities.",192,"he slept, and what he said. The routine was numbing, but it was also reassuring. It was a reminder that, no matter what else was going on, we were still a team, still working towards a common goal. And then, one day, Adela called me into her office. I assumed it was to discuss the project, to get an update on the progress we were making. But as soon as I sat down, I knew something was off. She was fidgeting with a pen, tapping it against her desk in a staccato rhythm. ""We need to talk about the subject,"" she said, her voice low and serious. I felt a jolt of fear, a sense of foreboding. What had happened? Had something gone wrong with the experiment? ""What is it?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. Adela hesitated, then leaned forward. ""We've been getting some... unusual readings,"" she said. ""His heart rate is fluctuating wildly, and his blood pressure is through the roof. We're not sure what's causing it, but we need to figure it out, fast."" I felt a surge of concern, a sense of responsibility. We had to get to the bottom of this, had to make sure the subject was safe. ""What do you need me to do?"" I asked, already mentally preparing myself for the task ahead. Adela's eyes locked onto mine, her gaze intense. ""I need you to review the data, to see if you can find any patterns or anomalies. We need to know what's going on, and we need to know now."" I nodded, my mind racing with possibilities. I knew that this was a critical moment, one that could make or break the entire project. I was determined to get to the bottom of it, no matter what it took."
"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events. He’d lain motionless in the garden for two hours, on","a wet and putrid night, to shoot a fox, and pulled out one of his own rotting teeth (he showed it to me afterward; it was the color of a tombstone, caped with gelatinous red)—was this Victorian, or was this “irregularities”?",81,"the stone bench, his eyes fixed on some point beyond the treeline. I'd tried to rouse him, but he hadn't responded, not even to the sound of his name. The sun had begun to set, casting long shadows across the garden, and still he remained frozen. I'd considered calling for an ambulance, but something about the scene stayed my hand. It was as if Graham had simply stepped out of the world, leaving me to wonder if I was dreaming the whole thing. As the stars began to twinkle in the night sky, I reluctantly went inside, leaving him to his mysterious reverie. The next morning, I found him in the kitchen, sipping tea and reading the newspaper as if nothing had happened. I asked him if he was feeling alright, and he looked up at me with a hint of surprise, as if he'd forgotten I was there. ""Of course, I'm fine,"" he said, his voice a little gruff. ""Why wouldn't I be?"" I didn't press the issue, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something fundamental had shifted, like the subtle realignment of the planets. From that day on, Graham's behavior became increasingly erratic, as if he was navigating a reality that was no longer quite my own."
"So I was anxious about Graham’s disdain for the twenty-first century, because never mind that I felt rejected by it, I was worried that the universe would feel the atemporal sting of his contempt and take","him away. My England wasn’t like this, he’d told me—but this was the natural evolution of his England. I was the natural evolution. I was his lens if he would only raise me and look with me.",73,"it out on me. I was worried that the universe would somehow sense Graham's disdain and decide that I was the one who was out of place, not him. I was worried that I would be the one to pay the price for his refusal to adapt. I was worried that I would be the one to be left behind, stuck in a world that was moving forward without me. I was worried that I would be the one to be erased, deleted from the timeline like a mistake. I was worried that I would be the one to be forgotten, lost in the annals of history like a footnote. I was worried that I would be the one to be replaced, swapped out for a newer, shinier model. I was worried that I would be the one to be left alone, the last one standing in a world that had moved on without me. I was worried that I would be the one to be the relic of a bygone era, a reminder of a time that was best left forgotten. I was worried that I would be the one to be the ghost in the machine, a haunting presence that refused to be exorcised. I was worried that I would be the one to be the anomaly, the glitch in the system that couldn't be fixed. I was worried that I would be the one to be the mistake, the error that couldn't be corrected. I was worried that I would be the one to be the aberration, the deviation from the norm that couldn't be tolerated. I was worried that I would be the one to be the outcast, the pariah that couldn't be accepted. I was worried that I would be the one to be the stranger, the outsider that couldn't be trusted. I was worried that I would be the one to be the alien, the other that couldn't be understood. I was worried that I would be the one to be the monster, the creature that couldn't be loved. I was worried that I would be the one to be the freak, the aberration that couldn't be accepted. I was worried that I would be the one to be the reject, the castoff that couldn't be redeemed. I was worried that I would be the one to be the loser, the failure that couldn't be forgiven. I was worried that I would be the one to be the nothing, the zero that couldn't be counted. I was worried that I would be the one to be the void, the empty space that couldn't be filled. I was worried that I would be the one to be the silence, the quiet that couldn't be broken. I was worried that I would be the one to be the darkness, the shadow that couldn't be lit. I was worried that I would be the one to be the end, the finality that couldn't be undone."
"I persuaded Graham to use the tiny office, in which I ordinarily worked, to cram for the test. The Ministry gave no indication of what format","the test would take, or what manner of questions would be asked, or tasks set. I thought this was unfair, and suggested as much to him.",52,"the test would take, so Graham had to be prepared for anything. He spent hours poring over his notes, trying to commit every detail to memory. I helped him make flashcards and quizzed him on the material, trying to simulate the pressure of the actual test. As the day of the test approached, Graham's confidence grew, and I could see the tension in his shoulders begin to ease. I was confident that he would do well, but I couldn't shake the feeling that the Ministry had something up its sleeve. On the morning of the test, Graham and I arrived at the Ministry early, and were ushered into a large, dimly lit room filled with rows of desks. The other test-takers were already seated, their faces set with determination. Graham took a deep breath, and we exchanged a nod of encouragement before he took his seat and the test began."
"There was an embarrassed silence, then: “Shame!” yelled Margaret","from the audience. “Fie! Rhubarb, rhubarb! And diverse other curses!”",19,"from the back of the room, her voice echoing off the walls as she stood up, her eyes flashing with indignation, and for a moment, it seemed like the whole room was holding its breath, waiting to see what would happen next, but then, just as suddenly, the tension was broken by the sound of laughter, and the room erupted into a cacophony of chatter and snickers, as people began to murmur to each other, and the atmosphere began to shift, like the tide turning, from one of shock and outrage to one of curiosity and intrigue."
"The person I was referring to was lurking at the far edge of the auditorium, with hair the color of wet earth under moonlight and a pinched, unhappy expression. I don’t think Salese could have looked more disapproving if we’d all started","sucking at one another’s fleshly parts and chanting “Hail, Satan!” The Brigadier was standing beside Salese. They were speaking, heads close together. They looked as if they were in an invisible bell jar of gloom which blocked out the room’s miniature festivities.",84,"chanting hymns to the devil himself. The air around him seemed to vibrate with disapproval, and I could almost see the weight of his displeasure settling upon us like a shroud. His eyes, a deep, rich brown that seemed to hold a world of sorrow within them, narrowed as he took in the scene before him. I felt a shiver run down my spine as his gaze met mine, and for a moment, I was convinced that he could see right through me, to the very heart of my being. The room seemed to grow quieter, as if everyone was holding their breath in anticipation of what he might do next. And then, in an instant, he turned and disappeared into the crowd, leaving behind a sense of unease that lingered long after he was gone. I turned to Salese, who was watching me with a curious expression, and raised an eyebrow. ""Who is that?"" I mouthed, but she just shook her head and leaned in closer. ""I have no idea,"" she whispered, ""but I think we're about to find out."""
"“I’m afraid I’ve only ever met the Secretary,” said the Brigadier.",“But I would very much like to meet Vice Secretary Adela.”,22,"“Yes, well, the Minister is a very busy man,” said the Brigadier, “but I’m sure he’ll see us. After all, we do have an appointment.” He glanced at his watch, then back at the door. “I expect he’s running a bit behind schedule. Ministers usually do.” He smiled wryly. “I’m sure it won’t be long now.” Just then, the door opened and a tall, thin man with a pinched face and a briefcase under his arm looked out. “Ah, Brigadier,” he said, “good of you to come. Please, come in.”"
"I went home and, on arrival, checked my emails. As with a driving",test—or the lieutenants’ exam—the acclimatization exam results were delivered immediately. Graham had passed.,26,"licence, I had to be extremely careful not to get too many points on my digital licence, or I would be banned from using the internet for a month. I had already received two warnings for downloading copyrighted material, and I was determined not to get a third. As I scrolled through my inbox, I noticed an email from an unknown sender. The subject line read "" Urgent: Your Digital Licence is at Risk"". My heart sank as I opened the email, fearing the worst. But to my surprise, it was just a phishing scam trying to get me to click on a suspicious link. I breathed a sigh of relief and deleted the email, making a mental note to be more careful in the future. I then proceeded to check my social media accounts, where I found a flurry of notifications from my friends and family. It seemed that everyone was having a great day, and I couldn't help but feel a little left out. I decided to post a status update, hoping to get some attention and feel more connected to the world. As I typed away, I couldn't help but wonder what other digital surprises the day had in store for me."
"I cycled up to the nice grocery store to buy a bottle of champagne, pausing on the way home for a soft-serve ice cream. I sat on the bench to lick the ripple into a mound and think about the","Brigadier. A man of bivouac experience, I felt; there was something disturbingly makeshift about both him and Salese, as if they’d been dropped behind enemy lines and were mimicking familiarity while waiting for the right moment to cut a throat.",80,"moment that was about to unfold. The warm sun on my skin and the cool ice cream on my tongue created a perfect harmony, allowing my mind to wander to the surprise party I had planned for my partner's birthday. I had managed to keep it a secret for weeks, and the excitement was building up inside me. As I sat there, I thought about the look on their face when they would walk into the room filled with our closest friends and family, the sound of laughter and music, and the smell of cake and food. I couldn't wait to see the surprise and joy in their eyes. I finished my ice cream, feeling content and eager to get home and put the final touches on the party preparations. The champagne I had bought would be the perfect addition to the celebration, and I was confident that this would be a birthday to remember. With a spring in my step, I got back on my bike and pedaled home, feeling grateful for the love and connection I shared with my partner and our community."

One of the panel was a Scotsman, and I think he liked that.”",34,"be able to live a relatively normal life, free from the pressures of being a high-profile couple. The rugged landscape and sparse population would provide us with the perfect cover to blend in and keep a low profile. We could spend our days exploring the rolling hills, visiting quaint villages, and enjoying the simple pleasures in life. Arthur, being the romantic that he is, would likely fall in love with the picturesque lochs and the sound of the bagpipes carried on the wind. I, on the other hand, would be content with the peace and quiet, and the freedom to pursue my passions without the constant scrutiny of the media. Together, we could build a life that is truly our own, one that is filled with love, laughter, and adventure."
"When I brought the glass up—stoppering the rest of the bottle for dinner—I could hear Graham singing “I love to steal awhile away,” occasionally muffled by his drags on a cigarette. Water plashed against the tub.","He dropped to humming and presumably soaping. I slid quietly to the floor and leaned my head against the wall. I wasn’t going to see a Ministry therapist. I knew I should, and I knew I wouldn’t.",73,"The sound was soothing, and I felt my muscles relax as I settled into the warm water. Graham's voice was low and smooth, and the song seemed to match the rhythm of the water lapping against the sides of the tub. I closed my eyes, letting the warmth seep into my bones, and listened to the gentle melody. As I lay there, I felt my worries slowly start to unravel, like the threads of a rope slowly coming undone. The music, the water, and the quiet of the evening all combined to create a sense of peace that I hadn't felt in a long time. I let out a deep sigh, feeling my body relax even further, and let the tranquility wash over me."
"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century. On ships there were cooks and officers’ stewards; at home, on the few occasions he was at home, there were women. Nevertheless, he had taken to cooking in a way he had failed to take to","television or texting or the use of deodorants (“I bathe every day,” he’d said to me with hurt dignity). Tonight, he hummed with a busyness that hardly shielded nervousness. He burned the onions and automatically reached for his cigarettes. I took them away—I didn’t want ashy Bolognese—and he accused me of “nanny-stating” him, a turn of phrase I found very alarming because I certainly hadn’t taught it to him. Where was he picking this stuff up?",152,"most other domestic pursuits. He found the simple, methodical nature of the task appealing, and the sense of satisfaction he derived from watching a meal come together was a welcome respite from the chaos that often accompanied his work. Graham's culinary skills had improved dramatically since his arrival in the twenty-first century, and he had developed a particular fondness for experimenting with new recipes and ingredients. His small kitchen was well-stocked with an assortment of pots, pans, and utensils, and he spent many an evening browsing through cookbooks and watching instructional videos to hone his craft. As he chopped, sautéed, and seasoned his way through various dishes, Graham felt a sense of calm wash over him, a feeling that was all too rare in his line of work. The sizzle of onions and the aroma of roasting meats were a far cry from the sounds and smells of his usual haunts, and he reveled in the simple pleasure of creating something nourishing and delicious. And yet, despite his growing confidence in the kitchen, Graham couldn't shake the feeling that he was merely playing at being a cook, that his true calling lay elsewhere. The memories of his past lingered, refusing to be extinguished by the warmth and comfort of his newfound hobby. The ghosts of his former life continued to haunt him, their presence a reminder that no matter how hard he tried to move on, a part of him would always remain rooted in the world he had left behind."
Margaret was wearing high-waisted cerulean bell-bottoms and a white blouse clocked with lace. She looked like a disco,"goddess, an astonishing concoction given that she was only barely older than the piano, never mind the synth.",36,"queen from another era, and yet, she moved with a quiet confidence that commanded attention. Her dark hair cascaded down her back in loose waves, and her bright smile could light up the entire room. As she walked into the crowded café, the sounds of espresso machines and hushed conversations filled the air, but Margaret's presence was like a breath of fresh air, turning heads and sparking curiosity. She slid onto a stool at the counter, her eyes scanning the menu with a look of intense focus, as if the secrets of the universe were hidden within the list of coffee drinks and pastry offerings. The barista, a young woman with a nose ring and a warm smile, greeted Margaret with a friendly hello, and the two of them launched into a conversation that flowed like a gentle stream, easy and effortless. As they talked, Margaret's eyes sparkled with laughter, and her whole being seemed to radiate a sense of joy and contentment, as if she had found a little slice of heaven in this bustling café."
"Arthur was happy and flushed. He was one of those unusual extroverts who have all the attributes of an introvert, save that they like being around other people. He had a gift for gentleness too, one of the rarest virtues in","any gender and especially in the kind of man Arthur was supposed to be. I eased some biography out of him: half-decent public school; classics at Oxford, where he’d had a lot of fun and failed his exams; retraining as a doctor.",83,"human nature. It was a quality that made him an exceptional listener, and people often found themselves opening up to him with ease. As he walked through the crowded room, he was met with warm smiles and nods of recognition. His eyes sparkled with genuine interest as he made his way from one conversation to the next, effortlessly weaving in and out of discussions. Despite his outgoing personality, Arthur had a unique ability to make each person feel like they were the only one in the room, and this gift had earned him a special place in the hearts of those around him. As the evening wore on, Arthur's laughter echoed through the room, a contagious sound that drew others in and made them feel like they were part of something special. And though he was the center of attention, Arthur never seemed to seek it out, content instead to simply be present and enjoy the company of those around him."
I saw Graham’s eyebrow quirk in a rascally way as he did,"the math. “You became a captain extremely quickly, Sixteen. Found your forte?”",24,"his best to stifle a grin, and I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation, which only seemed to egg him on further, his eyes sparkling with mischief as he continued to try and keep a straight face, the tension between us palpable and playful at the same time."
"Arthur grimaced. I saw his hand shiver momentarily on his glass, and then he","swallowed everything in it with a wet click. “Promotion was—fast—in the war,” he said shortly.",29,"steadied it, his eyes narrowing as he took a sip of his drink. The tension in the room seemed to escalate, and I found myself wondering what had caused this sudden shift in his demeanor. His eyes locked onto mine, and for a moment, I felt like he was trying to convey a message, but before I could decipher it, he looked away, his gaze drifting back to the crowd. The music and laughter continued to fill the air, but the atmosphere had become strained, like a thin layer of ice waiting to crack."
"Margaret, incidentally, listened to the men talk about their careers with a suffused urgency that only I noticed. In her own era, she’d slept in the room next to the one where she had been born.","She thought Scotland was far-flung and semi-barbaric. When we came round to talking about my time working as a translator in Cambodia, I felt her attention all over me. I may have talked slightly too much.",72,"Her eyes would light up with a mix of nostalgia and longing as they spoke of their accomplishments, and I could sense the weight of her own unfulfilled aspirations. It was as if the stories of others had awakened a deep-seated yearning within her, a yearning that she had long suppressed. I wondered what dreams she had put on hold, what passions she had set aside, and what regrets she harbored. As the evening wore on, Margaret's gaze would often drift toward the window, her eyes lost in the darkness beyond, and I couldn't help but feel that she was searching for something just out of reach. The men, oblivious to her introspection, continued to regale us with tales of their triumphs, but I was drawn to Margaret's quiet contemplation, sensing that there was a profound story hidden beneath her reserved demeanor."
"How the topic of weed came up I couldn’t remember—probably during one of the vigorous debates about what the twenty-first century had genuinely improved, which in",the opinion of the expats was a mixed bag. I was shortly handing my grinder and papers to Graham (who was far more adept at rolling).,52,"our discussion had devolved into a heated argument over the merits of social media versus the quality of modern music. But somehow, amidst the chaos, the topic of weed had emerged, and now we were all passionately discussing its potential benefits and drawbacks. Alex, ever the contrarian, was arguing that the widespread legalization of marijuana had led to a decline in productivity, while Rachel countered that it had opened up new avenues for medical research and treatment. I listened intently, intrigued by the various perspectives, as we delved deeper into the complexities of the issue. As the night wore on, our conversation only grew more animated, with each of us drawing from our own experiences and knowledge to make our points. It was moments like these that I cherished, when our debates became less about winning an argument and more about exploring the intricacies of a topic together."
"Meeting Margaret made me vivid and receptive. Sentences weighed more. I kept a half-conscious catalog of where the men were looking. I’ve seen people deal with this in different ways. By “this,” I mean power. I mean magnetism. I try to absorb it. Within twenty minutes Margaret","and I were planning a girls-take-Soho night out, which necessitated me explaining the history of Soho, the concept of clubbing, the genre of R & B, the club night R & She, and dancing. I hadn’t been clubbing since I was an assistant in Languages. No matter.",94,"had drawn a small crowd of admirers, all of whom were vying for her attention. I watched with a mixture of fascination and discomfort as she effortlessly commanded the room. Her presence was like a gravitational pull, drawing people in with an otherworldly force. I found myself wondering what it would be like to possess such power, to be able to captivate others with a single glance. As I stood there, observing the scene unfold, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy. Who was this woman, and how did she do it? I felt a sudden urge to know more about her, to unravel the mystery that surrounded her like an aura. And so, I took a step forward, inserting myself into the circle of admirers, and waited for an opportunity to strike up a conversation. As I waited, I couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation, wondering if I would be able to keep up with her, to match her level of intensity and charisma. But I was determined to try, to see if I could learn from her, to absorb some of that magnetism for myself. Little did I know, my life was about to take a dramatic turn, one that would challenge everything I thought I knew about myself and the world around me."
"“Such matters are between myself and God,” he said gravely. “Oh, stop frowning, Sixty-five.","Arthur, will you please lead her in a polka, if you can still stand.”",28,"“You look as though you've lost your last marble. I'm not going to let a little thing like a crisis of faith get in the way of our mission. Now, let's get moving before those Imperial goons catch up with us.” He flashed a reassuring smile, but Sixty-five's expression remained skeptical. As they walked, the silence between them grew thicker, like a fog rolling in off the ocean. It wasn't until they stumbled upon a small, rundown café on the outskirts of town that the tension finally began to dissipate. Over steaming cups of black coffee, he launched into a tale of his childhood, of laughter and love and loss, and for the first time, Sixty-five saw a glimmer of the man behind the mask."
"“In this age, musicians are imprinted inside music boxes, and there is no need for the band to","keep time,” said Margaret. “You will instruct me in the polka, or I will step on your toes.”",36,"be physically present to play their instruments. The music boxes can be easily transported and set up at various venues, making live performances more accessible and convenient. However, this technology has also raised concerns about the future of live music and the role of musicians in the industry. Some argue that the music boxes are a threat to the livelihoods of musicians, while others see them as an opportunity for new and innovative forms of musical expression. As the debate continues, one thing is certain - the music boxes have revolutionized the way we experience and interact with music. They have opened up new possibilities for collaboration and creativity, and have enabled musicians to reach a wider audience than ever before. But as we move forward in this new era of music, it is essential that we consider the impact of this technology on the musicians who are at the heart of it all."
"Arthur, by contrast, danced beautifully. He dipped me, and I bent like","a reed. He spun me, and I was, with such satisfaction, spun.",24,"a willow in the wind, my back arched and my arms extended, as if I were a ballerina on stage. The music swirled around us, a lively tune that seemed to match the rhythm of our hearts beating as one. As we twirled across the dance floor, the other couples faded into the background, and all that mattered was the gentle pressure of Arthur's hand on my waist and the way his eyes sparkled with joy. In that moment, I felt carefree and alive, my worries and fears left behind like discarded shoes at the door. The world narrowed to the space between us, and I knew that I was exactly where I was meant to be."
"As soon as she stepped in, I started making a tally of the evidence of unbeauty. There was a chair whose seat was filled with clothes too dirty for the wardrobe but too clean for the washing basket. My bedside table sprouted two water glasses and a mug. Dust crouched on the skirting boards and in the seams of","my chest of drawers. When a woman is as impossibly attractive as Margaret, the mediocrity shed by a woman like me bustles around her like a horde of pigeons. Or so I thought, at that time. Truthfully, I’d been foxed by how beautiful she was. I felt a complicated anguish when I saw her little besocked toes treadling the carpet.",119,"the furniture, like a patient predator waiting for its moment to pounce. The air was heavy with the smell of stale air and yesterday's cooking. I felt a familiar sense of discomfort as I took in the chaos, my mind racing with the thought of all the things that needed to be done to restore order to this space. But as I turned to face her, I saw that she was not looking at the mess, but at me, a small smile playing on her lips. It was as if she could see right through the clutter and the grime, to the person beneath. And in that moment, I felt a pang of self-consciousness, a sense that I was being seen in a way that I had not been seen in a long time. I looked away, feeling a flush rise to my cheeks, and began to busy myself with the task of tidying up, trying to distract myself from the feeling of vulnerability that had settled over me. But as I worked, I couldn't shake the sense that she was still watching me, seeing me in a way that I couldn't see myself."
Margaret appeared unaware of any of these concerns. She didn’t even glance at herself,in the mirror. She gave me an interested grin as I pulled out my lipsticks.,29,"in the mirror that hung on the wall, her eyes fixed on some point outside the window as she mechanically went about her morning routine, her movements practiced and efficient. The soft morning light streaming through the window highlighted the sharp angles of her face, but her expression remained serene, a mask that hid her true thoughts and feelings. As she moved through the room, the silence was broken only by the soft rustle of her clothes and the occasional creak of the old wooden floorboards beneath her feet."
"I’d stopped wearing it—I was, at the time, thinking of the way my face might be received by a Victorian who didn’t approve of cosmetics—but I demonstrated the coverage of my sole foundation. Margaret","was amazed by the smoothness of its application and the faithfulness of its shade. She drew an arrow with it on her cheek. On her fair skin, it looked like clay. We started giggling.",68,"was taken aback by the transformation, her eyes widening in surprise as she took in the subtle yet noticeable difference it made. She reached out a hand, hesitantly, as if seeking permission to touch my skin, and I nodded, intrigued by her fascination. As her fingers made contact, she gasped, marveling at the smooth, even tone that now covered my cheeks and forehead. ""It's like magic,"" she breathed, her voice barely above a whisper. I smiled, pleased that she was so impressed, and began to explain the science behind it, launching into a detailed explanation of pigments and emulsions. But as I spoke, I couldn't help but notice the way Margaret's eyes kept drifting back to my face, a look of wonder still etched on her features. It was as if she had never seen anything like it before, and I realized, with a start, that she probably hadn't. In her time, cosmetics were likely a rare and exotic luxury, reserved for the wealthy and the aristocratic. I felt a pang of excitement at the thought of introducing her to the vast array of products and techniques that were now available, and I found myself making a mental list of all the things I wanted to show her."
"The door grumbled shut and I fell back into a doze. Margaret was snoring lightly, like a puppy being squeezed. The door reopened, and I","surfaced to vague consciousness. I felt a wave of cool air, and then a gentle warmth. He had spread a blanket over the pair of us.",51,"sat up with a start, my heart racing as I took in the figure standing in the doorway. It was a woman, tall and imposing, with a stern expression on her face. She was dressed in a long, black coat that seemed to swallow her whole, and a wide-brimmed hat cast a shadow over her eyes. She regarded us for a moment, her gaze lingering on Margaret's peaceful form before shifting to me. I felt a shiver run down my spine as she stepped forward, her eyes narrowing as she took in my disheveled appearance. ""You're the ones they've been searching for,"" she stated, her voice low and husky. I rubbed my eyes, trying to shake off the remnants of sleep, but the woman's words only added to my confusion. Who was she, and what did she want with us? I glanced at Margaret, but she was still fast asleep, oblivious to the stranger's presence. The woman's gaze followed mine, and for a moment, I thought I saw a flicker of something like concern in her eyes. But it was quickly extinguished, replaced by a mask of determination. ""We need to get out of here,"" she said, her voice firm. ""Now."""
"All the expats had phones, paid for (and tapped) by the Ministry. Graham had switched his own phone on a total of three times in the seven","months he had been in the twenty-first century. I was therefore unsurprised when, about half an hour after their plane landed, I got a call from Arthur’s phone.",55,"months he had been in the country, and each time it was to call his wife, brief conversations that left him feeling empty and disconnected. The Ministry's tapping was a given, but Graham had grown accustomed to the feeling of being watched, of being a specimen under a microscope. He had tried to convince himself that it was a small price to pay for the opportunity to work in this enigmatic country, but the isolation was starting to wear on him. The other expats seemed to have adapted more easily, gathering at the Ministry-sponsored social events and exchanging stories of their adventures. Graham had attended a few of these gatherings, but he always felt like an outsider, a ghost hovering on the periphery of their conversations. His wife's voice on the phone was the only thing that seemed real to him anymore, a reminder of the life he had left behind."
"Arthur was striding up the street, bent slightly against a wind which didn’t exist. He was wearing a tweed jacket and looked like a period piece,","but then again, so did Pimlico. I hadn’t seen him since the men had got back from Scotland and I asked him whether he enjoyed his trip.",53,"his eyes fixed intently on some point in the distance. The people passing by him seemed to be moving in a blur, their faces a mere smudge as he walked. His hands were shoved deep into his pockets, and his shoulders were hunched up, giving him a slightly defensive air. The buildings around him seemed to loom over, their windows like empty eyes staring back. He turned a corner, and the sounds of the city grew louder, a cacophony of car horns and chatter that he tuned out as he walked. His destination was a small café a few blocks away, a place he had been going to for years, where the owner knew him by name and the coffee was always strong. He pushed open the door, and a bell above it rang out, announcing his arrival to the handful of patrons inside."
"It paid off in the early autumn. When I came down for breakfast one morning, I found","Graham at the counter with a dictionary and a tin of protein powder, performing exegesis on the label.",35,"my mother and father sitting at the kitchen table, surrounded by the remnants of a meal that had clearly been interrupted. There were plates of half-eaten toast, cups of cold coffee, and a general air of chaos that seemed to permeate every corner of the room. My mother looked up as I entered, a mixture of excitement and nervousness etched on her face, while my father simply nodded at me, his eyes fixed intently on some point beyond my shoulder. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I took in the scene, sensing that something momentous had occurred, something that would change the course of our lives forever."
"Adela was of the “never been to the GP in my life because I’m not a pussy” school of care, and nothing changed. If the expats were","dangerously ill, they’d be removed to the wards and never mind the trigger; if they could get a grip and deal with it at home, they should.",54,"going to get sick, they would get sick in the comfort of their own homes, with a stiff upper lip and a bottle of scotch. The locals, on the other hand, seemed to have a different approach to healthcare. They would often gather in the town square, sharing stories of their ailments and offering each other advice on the best remedies. Adela had always been fascinated by this communal approach to health, but she had never felt the need to join in. That was until she met Sofia, a local woman who had taken Adela under her wing and introduced her to the world of traditional medicine. Sofia was a firm believer in the power of natural remedies and had spent years studying the healing properties of the local plants. She would often take Adela on long walks through the countryside, pointing out the different herbs and explaining their uses. Adela was amazed by the wealth of knowledge that Sofia possessed and found herself drawn to the idea of a more holistic approach to healthcare. As she spent more time with Sofia, Adela began to realize that there was more to health than just not being sick. She started to see the interconnectedness of the body and the mind, and the importance of taking care of oneself in a more holistic way. This newfound understanding sparked a change in Adela, and she slowly began to shift her approach to healthcare. She started taking long walks in the countryside, breathing in the fresh air and listening to the sounds of nature. She began to experiment with natural remedies, using the herbs that Sofia had taught her about to soothe her ailments. And she started to prioritize her mental health, taking time each day to meditate and connect with her inner self. It wasn't always easy, and there were still times when Adela felt the urge to reach for the scotch. But with Sofia's guidance and support, she slowly began to find a new sense of balance and well-being. As the months passed, Adela noticed a profound shift in her overall health. She felt more energized and vibrant, and her mind was clearer than it had been in years. She realized that she had been living in a state of disconnection, and that her body and mind had been suffering as a result. But now, thanks to Sofia and the world of traditional medicine, Adela felt like she was finally coming home to herself."
"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs. Given the prevalence of prostitution in Victorian England, the nonexistence of reliable barrier contraception in his era, and the fact that he was a sailor, this suggested he was either a virgin or very lucky. But then again, I knew enough about his biography to know that he was very, very lucky.",141,"of the transcript of that session, and I'd read it several times, trying to decipher the nuances of his responses. The analyst had asked him if he thought the modern obsession with sex was a healthy one, and Graham had replied that it seemed to him a ""fussy"" and ""overwrought"" business, rather like the excessive ornamentation on a Rococo vase. He'd also mentioned that he found the language surrounding sex to be ""coarse"" and ""unbecoming,"" which had led the analyst to note that Graham's own language was often formal and antiquated, as if he were trying to distance himself from the world around him."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory. Every time I gave Graham a book, I was trying to shunt him along a story I’d been telling myself all my life.",101,"something almost palpable in the air when I spoke to her, a sense that I was imparting secrets that would forever change the way she viewed the world. I felt a thrill of excitement at the prospect of shaping her perceptions, of being the one to introduce her to the complexities and nuances of this foreign land. But it was a double-edged sword, this power to inform and influence. I knew that I was also vulnerable to the same forces, that my own understanding of the world was filtered through the lens of my own experiences and biases. I wondered, as I gazed into Margaret's eager face, how much of what I was telling her was truth, and how much was simply my own interpretation. And I couldn't help but wonder, too, what she would make of it all, what she would take away from our conversations and how it would shape her own worldview. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, a reminder that the power to shape and influence was a weighty responsibility, one that I wasn't sure I was fully equipped to handle."
Graham was adamant about not informing the Ministry about his illness. It was the closest I had,ever seen him to entreating. I thought about it a lot. I liked being entreated by him.,34,"ever come to understanding the weight of his responsibilities as an Auror, and the toll it took on his personal life. His eyes, though still bright with determination, seemed to hold a hint of desperation, a silent plea for me to keep his secret safe. I nodded, and he knew I would respect his wishes, no matter the cost. Little did I know, this was only the beginning of a series of events that would change the course of our lives forever."
"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled. Then again, whose upper management am I not describing? Who trusts their workplace? Who thinks their job is on the side of right? They fed us all poison from a bottle marked “prestige,” and we developed a high tolerance for bitterness. I would have been more frightened if the pressure lifted, like an indoor cat struck by sudden rain.",119,"and her alibis were worse. But I had no choice. I had to trust her, or at least pretend to, if I was going to get out of that place alive. And besides, I had my own reasons for being there, my own secrets to keep. I wasn't about to start questioning hers too closely. Not then, at least. It wasn't until later, when I was safely away from that awful place, that I started to think about Adela's inconsistencies, to wonder if she had been playing me all along. And even then, I couldn't be sure. Maybe she was just scared, like me. Maybe she was just trying to survive. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I had been blind, that I had let my desire to escape cloud my judgment. And now, I was left with nothing but questions, and a growing sense of unease. What had really happened in that place? And what had Adela's true role been? I knew I might never find out, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I had been a part of something much bigger, and much darker, than I had ever imagined."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.",39,"that a man could be in two places at once. I told him it was impossible, but he just shook his head and said I was wrong. He said he had seen it with his own eyes, and that I was just trying to cover it up. I tried to explain to him that it was just a trick of the mind, but he wouldn't listen. He kept pushing me for answers, and I could see the determination in his eyes. I knew I had to think fast, or he would uncover the truth. So, I took a deep breath and began to spin a web of lies, hoping to confuse him and throw him off the scent. But as I spoke, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was in over my head, and that Graham was getting closer to the truth with every passing moment."
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.",56,"his lips, a look of deep contemplation on his face. The room was filled with the savory aroma of roasting meat and the sweet, pungent smell of burning tobacco. I could hear the sizzle of food on the stovetop and the soft crackle of the cigarette as he inhaled. Graham looked up as I entered, a hint of a smile on his lips, and I could sense a mix of emotions swirling beneath his calm exterior. The air was thick with tension, and I could tell that something was on his mind, something he was struggling to put into words. I hung my coat on the hook by the door and walked over to the stove, curiosity getting the better of me. ""What's cooking?"" I asked, trying to sound casual despite the sense of foreboding that had settled in the pit of my stomach. Graham's eyes flickered towards the stove, and he took a long drag on his cigarette before answering, his voice low and measured. ""Just a little something I'm trying out,"" he said, his eyes drifting back to the cigarette, his gaze intense. I raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite myself, and walked over to the table to take a seat beside him. The evening stretched out before us, full of possibilities and uncertainties, and I couldn't help but wonder what the night had in store for us."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers. He took in anecdotes about my childhood meals as if they would contribute to a portrait of a whole woman. He ignored the fact that mostly I cooked assorted chicken pieces on rice. I could tell him things about galangal, and he found that very profound.",94,"lines. His curiosity was infectious, and soon I found myself explaining the intricacies of nasi lemak and char kway teow, the way the combination of ingredients and spices could evoke a sense of comfort and nostalgia. As we cooked, the aromas wafting from the wok transported me back to my childhood, and I began to see my mother's recipes in a new light. Graham's enthusiasm was a catalyst, and I started to experiment with new flavors and techniques, incorporating the bold spices and fresh herbs of Southeast Asia into our meals. Our kitchen became a laboratory, with Graham as my willing guinea pig, eager to sample each new creation. The more we cooked, the more I realized that food was not just sustenance, but a bridge between cultures and memories, a way to connect with the past and forge new experiences. As the days turned into weeks, our culinary adventures became an integral part of our daily routine, a testament to the power of shared curiosity and creativity."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization. I wanted him in a role that didn’t require him to be at sea for months, possibly years,","at a time. It was too soon, I told myself. Whatever Adela said, he wasn’t ready, he’d barely left London, let alone land. But I wanted him to stay for other reasons too. It was humiliating to know that about myself and to say nothing into his implacable placidity.",98,"so I encouraged him to explore other options. He eventually landed a job at a local maritime museum, where he could share his knowledge and experience with visitors. I, on the other hand, was determined to find a job that would allow me to use my language skills, so I started applying to translation agencies and language schools. After a few weeks of job hunting, I finally received an offer from a small translation firm that specialized in technical translations. I was thrilled to start working on a wide range of projects, from engineering manuals to scientific articles. As we settled into our new routines, we began to feel more at home in our adopted city. We started taking weekend trips to explore the surrounding countryside, trying new restaurants, and attending local events. Our social circle slowly expanded as we met new people through work and social gatherings. We even started taking language classes to improve our proficiency in the local dialect. It wasn't always easy, but we were determined to make this new life work for us. We had to navigate cultural differences, learn new customs, and adapt to a new way of life, but with each passing day, we felt more confident and more at home."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.",64,"The soulful voice of John Lennon filled the room, a stark contrast to the tense atmosphere that had settled over the group. Graham, still trying to process the revelation, couldn't help but tap his foot along with the beat. The others, however, remained frozen, their eyes fixed on the figure standing before them. The music seemed to swell, the lyrics taking on a new meaning in the context of their situation. ""You've really got a hold on me,"" Lennon sang, and Graham felt a shiver run down his spine. It was as if the universe was trying to tell them something, but what, exactly, remained to be seen. As the song reached its climax, the group was jolted back to reality by the sound of footsteps echoing from outside the room."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes. One of his first searches was charmingly housewifely: “Most challenging recipes”; “How to make cheese soufflé”; “What is miso paste?”; “Where to buy miso paste”; “How long has Japan been open to Europe?” A day or so after I’d read this report, I received another that listed the following search terms:",122,"and that I would have to confront the reality of his online activities. I envisioned the worst-case scenario: Graham, a man in his late sixties, with a penchant for outdated slang and a wardrobe that seemed to have been frozen in time since the 1970s, secretly leading a life of unbridled debauchery. The thought sent shivers down my spine as I imagined the countless hours he must have spent scouring the depths of the internet for his fix of titillating content. My mind racing with the possibilities, I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets lay hidden behind his seemingly innocuous facade. Would I discover a treasure trove of illicit downloads, or perhaps a trail of digital breadcrumbs leading to some seedy online community? The uncertainty was almost too much to bear, and I found myself questioning my decision to take on this task in the first place. As I sat at my desk, staring blankly at the computer screen, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was about to uncover a dark and sinister truth about Graham, one that would forever change the way I saw him."
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing,","as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday. This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option. We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit. Still, we had not told them about the death camps.",151,"but to me it just looked like a lot of people getting very wet and trying to protect their homes from the rising water. I waded through the river that used to be our street, my wellies filling up with icy water, and made my way to the house. The front door was open, and I could hear the sound of my mum's voice, shouting instructions at someone. I pushed open the door and called out, ""Mum, I'm home!"" She appeared in the hallway, a look of relief on her face, and rushed over to give me a hug. ""I was worried sick about you,"" she said, holding me tightly. ""I'm fine, Mum,"" I said, trying to reassure her. ""I'm just a bit wet."" She laughed and helped me out of my coat, which was indeed soaked through. ""Come on, let's get you dried off and then we can start sandbagging,"" she said, leading me towards the stairs. As we went upstairs, I could hear the sound of my dad's voice, shouting at the TV in the living room. ""Idiots,"" he was saying. ""They should have done something about the drains years ago."" My mum rolled her eyes good-naturedly. ""Not now, dear,"" she said. ""We've got more important things to worry about."" I smiled to myself as I changed into some dry clothes. It was going to be a long night."
"“It’s better that we continue to work closely with Eighteen-forty-seven,” Adela","had said, “given that he seems likely to survive the year.”",22,"added, her voice firm but laced with a hint of desperation, ""we can't afford to alienate them now, not when we're so close to a breakthrough."" The room fell silent as the weight of her words settled over the assembled team, each member lost in their own thoughts about the implications of their collaboration with the enigmatic organization known only by its cryptic name, Eighteen-forty-seven."
"Adela’s voice contracted on that last sentence. She wiped her gaze, concentrated in her one working eye, up and down my face, to see if I’d noticed, and continued, “Our first priority","is protecting the expats and the time-door. The time-door has been moved to a secure location. I suggest you retake the physical aptitude assessment, and then we can work on your lateral-reasoning scores—”",65,"is to get you to a safe location. We can't stay here for long, it's not secure. I've arranged for a car to take us to a nearby safe house, where we can regroup and figure out our next move. But first, we need to get out of here without being seen. Stay close to me and follow my instructions carefully. We'll move quickly and quietly, and try to avoid drawing any attention to ourselves. Once we're in the car, we can breathe a little easier, but until then, we need to be vigilant. I know this is a lot to take in, but I need you to trust me and do exactly as I say. Can you do that for me?"
"Arthur was gentle, no matter how grotty my behavior. He had found out about Scrabble, and he sometimes brought",his travel set along—my inner competitive bitch could stave off a black mood for half an hour or so.,38,"his own board to our sessions, trying to entice me into a game. I would resist at first, but eventually, his persistence would wear me down, and we'd spend hours huddled over the board, lost in a world of words and letters. He was a formidable opponent, but he never gloated when he won, and he never made me feel bad when I lost. Instead, he'd offer words of encouragement, telling me that I was improving with each game, and that he was proud of me for trying. Those moments with Arthur were some of the few times I felt truly at peace, and I cherished them deeply. As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, I began to realize that Arthur's kindness and patience were having a profound impact on me. I was starting to see the world in a different light, to appreciate the small joys and beauty that surrounded me. And it was all thanks to Arthur, and his unwavering dedication to helping me find my way."
"My email made a chiding noise. Adela was the originator, and she’d put me in blind copy.",It was a short email. Adela had a real gift for cramming apoplexy into a couple of lines.,35,"Her message was brief, but the words cut deep. I felt a familiar knot in my stomach as I read the lines, my mind racing with the implications. It seemed that my recent decisions had not gone unnoticed, and Adela was not pleased. I could almost hear her voice, stern and disapproving, as I read the words on the screen. The fact that she had blind-copied me on the email only added to my unease, implying that I was not worthy of a direct address. I took a deep breath, trying to calm my nerves as I contemplated how to respond, or if I should respond at all."
The email told us that her death would be reported to the expats as,"a suicide. “This cannot be emphasized enough,” Adela had written, with a double underline.",28,"a tragic accident, and that we should not discuss the true circumstances with anyone outside of the group, in order to avoid any potential complications or repercussions. It was a heavy burden to carry, knowing that we were keeping such a significant secret from our friends and acquaintances, but we understood the importance of discretion in this matter. As the days passed, we struggled to come to terms with what had happened, and the weight of our silence hung over us like a cloud, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of confidentiality."
"Arthur smiled and sat down beside me, stretching out his long legs. Twisting the signet ring on his finger—a tell as","clarion as my skin biting—he murmured, “We didn’t know her as well as we would have liked. I wish we had.”",42,"he often did when he was nervous or deep in thought—he began to speak in a low, measured tone. ""I've been thinking a great deal about our situation, and I believe I've come to a realization. We can't keep running, not forever. Eventually, we'll need to find a way to face whatever is coming for us head-on."" His eyes locked onto mine, burning with an intensity that made my heart skip a beat. ""I know I've not always been the most forthcoming about my past, but I think it's time I told you the truth. The truth about who I am, about what I've done, and about the secrets I've kept hidden for so long."" He paused, taking a deep breath before continuing, his voice barely above a whisper. ""Are you ready to hear it, to really hear it, and to understand the implications of what it means for us?"""
"Anne Spencer almost made it off those wards. After I read the email, an ancient and exuberant terror blazed through me. It was partly the terror that had grown in me alongside my very bones,","knowing as I did that I only existed because my mother had outrun almost; I don’t know at what point you stop feeling the need to run, generation by generation, when you’re born after that.",70,"the terror that had been my constant companion since childhood, the one that I had learned to keep at bay with the help of therapy and medication. But it was also a new, sharper fear, one that was specifically tailored to the news I had just received. I felt like I was staring into the abyss, with no safety net to catch me if I fell. My mind was racing with worst-case scenarios, each one more terrifying than the last. I couldn't shake the feeling that my whole world was about to come crashing down around me. I tried to take a few deep breaths, to calm myself down, but my heart was racing and my hands were shaking. I felt like I was losing control, like I was powerless to stop the events that were unfolding. And then, just as suddenly as it had started, everything went black."
"He was sitting at the noisome kitchen table, staring at nothing. Rogue Male was lying splayed and face down by the ashtray. The thing in my chest kicked again","as I realized he must have grabbed it as we left our home. When I came in, he didn’t move anything but his gaze, which swung up like a whip.",59,"and I felt a familiar sense of dread creeping up my spine. I tried to shake it off, focusing on the scene before me. The dim fluorescent light above the table cast an eerie glow on the worn linoleum floor, and the air was thick with the stench of stale cigarettes and burnt coffee. I took a deep breath, trying to clear my head, but my mind was already racing with questions. What was he doing here? And what was that thing on the table? I approached cautiously, my eyes fixed on the object, and as I got closer, I realized it was a small, leather-bound book. I picked it up, blowing off the dust, and opened it to the first page. The words ""Property of E.M."" were scribbled in red ink, and a chill ran down my spine as I wondered who E.M. was and what this book had to do with the strange occurrences that had been plaguing me. I looked up to see Rogue Male still lying motionless, and I knew I had to get out of there, but my feet felt rooted to the spot. Suddenly, the kitchen was filled with an unsettling silence, and I felt like I was being watched. I spun around, but there was no one there. The thing in my chest kicked again, and I knew I had to get out, fast."
