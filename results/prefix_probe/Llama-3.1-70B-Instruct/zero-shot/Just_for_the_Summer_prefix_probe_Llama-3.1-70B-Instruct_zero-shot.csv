I [29m] have been friends with Chad [32m] since we were born. Our moms are best friends and we grew,"up together and were roommates for the last 10 years, up until the incident that set our current situation into motion.","up together, exploring the same neighborhoods and sharing the same interests.

As we grew older, our friendship only deepened, and we found ourselves supporting each other through thick and thin. We went to the same high school, played on the same sports teams, and even attended the same college. After graduation, we went our separate ways, but our friendship remained strong. Chad went on to pursue a career in business, while I followed my passion for art. Despite our different paths, we continued to stay in touch, meeting up regularly to catch up on each other's lives. Over the years, I've seen Chad go through many ups and downs, and he's been a constant source of support for me as well. I'm grateful to have him in my life, and I know that our friendship will last a lifetime."
"Anyway, forward to five months ago. I dated Hope [28f] for a few weeks. Not a big deal. We decided we weren’t feeling it, no chemistry, so we called it quits. And then lo and behold she hits","it off with Chad. Of course in true Good Luck Charm fashion, this means Chad is her soulmate. Chad is all googly-eyed over her, they’ve met the parents, they’re ring shopping—and they want to move in together. Immediately.","me up out of the blue and asks if I want to grab coffee.

So, we meet up, and it's all friendly and casual. We catch up on each other's lives, and I'm glad to see she's doing well. But then, things take a turn. She starts telling me about her new boyfriend, and how great he is, and how they're really serious. I'm happy for her, but I'm also thinking, ""Okay, this is a bit weird."" I mean, we didn't exactly have a deep connection, and I'm not sure why she's sharing all this with me. But I'm polite, so I listen and offer my congratulations. And then, she drops the bombshell. She tells me that her new boyfriend is actually my best friend, Alex. I'm taken aback, to say the least. I had no idea they were even dating, let alone serious. I try to play it cool, but inside, I'm reeling. I'm not sure how to process this information, or how to react. Part of me is happy for them, but another part of me is feeling a little betrayed. I mean, Alex is my best friend, and he didn't even tell me he was dating someone, let alone someone I used to date. I'm not sure what to do, or how to navigate this situation. I decide to play it cool for the rest of the coffee date, but as soon as I get home, I'm going to have to have a talk with Alex. This is definitely a conversation I'm not looking forward to."
"The only problem is that Chad has six more months on our lease but found a perfect new house for him and Hope, and he can’t afford to pay rent on two places at the same",time. So he had to make the difficult decision to screw me over or screw her over—and he picked me. Now I have to find a way to cover his rent until the lease is up.,"time.

I've been helping him post ads online and put up flyers around the neighborhood, but we haven't had any serious inquiries yet. It's getting a bit stressful, as the clock is ticking and Chad really needs to finalize the purchase of his new home. I've even offered to help him pay the rent for a few months, but he's adamant that he doesn't want to be a burden. I understand where he's coming from, but at the same time, I feel bad seeing him struggle with this decision. We've been friends for a long time, and I want to support him in any way I can. I just hope we can find a solution soon, for both our sakes."
"I’m annoyed, but I decided to try to find a reason to spend more time outside so I don’t have to stare out my window. I’ve always wanted a dog, but Chad would never agree to it. So I went to a rescue and found the ugliest animal there. The one so hideous, nobody else wanted it. This dog’s got an underbite and mange, and he’s missing half an","ear. He’s a little Brussels Griffon, so he’s got that deep frown—he looks like a judgmental gremlin. I adopted him and named him Chad since the dog is now my new best friend.

At first, Chad was furious when he came home to find this... creature in our living room. But Frankenstein's personality quickly won him over. The dog is a total sweetheart, always eager to please and playful despite his rough appearance. I started taking him on long walks around the neighborhood, and that's when I noticed something strange. People would cross the street to avoid us, or stare at Frankenstein with a mixture of horror and fascination. It was like they'd never seen a dog like him before. I realized that Frankenstein was not only a great companion, but also a conversation starter. I began to enjoy our walks more and more, not just for the exercise and fresh air, but for the reactions we got from strangers. Some people would even stop and ask to pet Frankenstein, and I could see the surprise in their eyes when they realized how gentle he was. It was as if they expected him to be as ugly on the inside as he was on the outside. But Frankenstein was proof that you can't judge a book by its cover. As the days turned into weeks, I found myself looking forward to our walks more and more. I'd take Frankenstein to the park, and we'd play fetch or just sit and watch the world go by. I started to notice the little things, like the way the sunlight filtered through the trees, or the sound of birds singing in the distance. It was as if I'd been living in a bubble, and Frankenstein had popped it, allowing me to see the world in a whole new way. And Chad, well, he was happy to see me happy, even if it meant putting up with Frankenstein's snoring and shedding. He'd joke that the dog was a good influence on me, and I think he was right. Frankenstein had brought a sense of joy and wonder into my life, and I was grateful for it. As I looked at him, sleeping at my feet, I knew that I'd made the right decision in adopting him. He may have been the ugliest dog at the rescue, but he was perfect in my eyes."
I tilted my head so my braid fell to one side and held up four fingers. Maddy,"didn’t look happy, but she took the picture with my phone, then handed it back to me.","raised an eyebrow, a small smile playing on her lips as she held up three fingers in response.",34,"raised an eyebrow, a small smile playing on her lips as she held up three fingers in response. I nodded, and we both lowered our hands, the unspoken signal sending us into a flurry of activity as we quickly gathered our things and slipped out of the crowded café, weaving past the lunchtime throng of people on the sidewalk. The cool spring air was a welcome respite from the stuffy atmosphere inside, and I took a deep breath, feeling the tension in my shoulders begin to ease as we walked. We didn't need to discuss our destination; we'd been over the plan countless times, and I knew Maddy would lead the way to the small, out-of-the-way bookstore where we were supposed to meet our contact. As we turned the corner onto the side street, I caught sight of the faded sign creaking in the gentle breeze, and my heart quickened with anticipation."
"“That dog trusts him,” Maddy said. “And that’s a rescue dog, so that means something. They’re usually all","skittish and freaked out.” She went quiet again looking at his wall. “Go down further,” Maddy said. “The billboard.”","skittish around new people, but that one seems to have taken a liking to him.

I've worked with rescue dogs for years, and I've never seen one form a bond with someone as quickly as that dog has with him. It's really quite remarkable. I think it says a lot about his character, don't you?"
That night after work Maddy made dinner. Grilled portobello mushrooms and rice pilaf. I did,"the dishes and cleaned the kitchen, then took a shower and blew out my hair.","the dishes while she cleaned up the kitchen, the smell of the mushrooms still",30,"the dishes while she cleaned up the kitchen, the smell of the mushrooms still lingering in the air. We sat down to eat, and I couldn't help but notice how quiet Maddy was being. She seemed lost in thought, her eyes fixed on some point beyond the table. I asked her if everything was okay, but she just shook her head and forced a smile. I let it go, figuring she'd talk about it when she was ready. We ate in silence for a while, the only sound the clinking of our forks against the plates. After dinner, we settled in on the couch to watch a movie, but my mind kept wandering back to Maddy's strange behavior. Was everything really okay, or was something bothering her that she wasn't telling me?"
"“Sorry, I had to give Brad his dewormer. I brought some for",you too. Faith said you’ve been dragging your ass on the carpet?”,"you too, just in case.

Would you like me to administer it to your horse as well, or do you want to do it yourself?"
My best friend was in a Hawaiian shirt and pink cargo shorts. He was a general manager at Trader Joe’s. I missed not having to go to the grocery store now,"that he had moved out. Actually, I missed a lot of things now that Brad had moved out. Like having another human to talk to, even if it was this one.","because he would bring home all the new and exciting products for us to try.

As we sat on the porch, watching the sunset, I couldn't help but feel grateful for our friendship and the memories we had shared over the years. He told me about the latest developments at Trader Joe's, from new store openings to innovative products that were flying off the shelves. I listened intently, fascinated by his passion for the business and his dedication to his work. As the night wore on, we decided to take a walk around the neighborhood, enjoying the warm summer air and the sound of crickets chirping in the distance. It was a simple, yet perfect evening, and I was grateful to have my friend back in town, even if only for a short visit."
"“This is true,” Brad said, looking at his phone. “We are",assholes. But only to each other.

Come on, let's hurry up and get going,” he urged, already heading towards the door, expecting his friends to follow closely behind. As they rushed out of the apartment, the sound of laughter and chatter filled the air, mingling with the distant hum of the city, creating an electric atmosphere that only a night out with friends could bring."
"Brad nodded at me. “You know, if she’s got the same thing you do,","if you guys date each other, you’ll both find your soulmates when you break up.”",it's possible she's been experiencing some of the same strange occurrences that have,29,"it's possible she's been experiencing some of the same strange occurrences that have been happening to you.

If we can find a way to harness your powers, we might be able to uncover the truth behind these mysterious events and help your friend at the same time."
They were starting to do the couples thing for all the trips and birthdays. They were all going up,"to Lutsen in October to go hiking. They asked me if I wanted to go, but I didn’t. Not alone.","to the mountains for a weekend getaway, and it was going to be the first time they would all",39,"to the mountains for a weekend getaway, and it was going to be the first time they would all be together in such a big group. The excitement was palpable as they made their way to the cabin, chatting and laughing together. As they arrived, they were greeted by the breathtaking view of the snow-capped peaks and the serene lake in the distance. The cabin was cozy and warm, with a fireplace crackling in the living room. They spent the evening swapping stories, sharing memories, and getting to know each other better. The next day, they went hiking and explored the beautiful trails, taking in the stunning scenery and enjoying the crisp mountain air. As the sun began to set, they gathered around the campfire, roasting marshmallows and sharing scary stories. It was a trip that none of them would ever forget, a chance to bond and create new memories together."
Brad took a swallow of his drink. “Ask that nurse out. Go,"wherever she is. Pitch the idea to her, she might be into it.”",on a date with her. You never know what might happen. She seems,25,"on a date with her. You never know what might happen. She seems nice, and you two have a good connection. Don't let fear hold you back.

You might just find someone special. So, take a deep breath, walk over to her, and ask her out. You can do this, and you won't regret it. Just be yourself, be respectful, and see where things go. You might be surprised at how well it turns out."
"“Yeah,” Brad said. “She dates you, you guys break up, and she rides happily into the sunset too. It’s a win-win. Seriously. This is your chance.",If you don’t do something you’re gonna spend the rest of your life sending women on to their forever families and never getting one for you.”,"to get back out there and start fresh.

The worst that could happen is you get hurt, but at least you'll know you tried. And who knows, you might just find something amazing. So what do you say? Are you in?"
Brad looked me in the eye. “You will never find someone as long as all the women you date aren’t actually meant for you. You’re not their,soulmate. Their soulmate is the person they meet after you. It’s decided the minute it starts. They are literally fated not to be The One.

I felt a sting from his honesty, but deep down, I knew he was right. I had been on countless dates, but none of them had ever truly felt like the one. There was always something missing, a spark that never quite ignited. Brad's words echoed in my mind as I thought back to all the women I had dated. There was Sarah, the free-spirited artist who had been too wild for my taste; Emily, the corporate lawyer who had been too focused on her career; and Rachel, the beautiful model who had been too self-absorbed. None of them had been my match, and I had known it from the start. But why had I continued to pursue them, to try and make something work that was never meant to be? The answer, I realized, lay within myself. I had been searching for someone to complete me, to fill the void that I felt inside. But what if that void wasn't meant to be filled by someone else? What if it was something I needed to confront and overcome on my own? The thought was both terrifying and liberating, and I knew that I had a long journey ahead of me to discover the truth."
"I had actually thought about her. I’d checked once or twice to see if she’d messaged me again. She hadn’t. The last message was me telling her it was nice chatting with her, three days ago.

I wondered what would have happened if I had been more persistent, if I had found a way to keep the conversation going. Would we have hit it off? Would we have become friends, or maybe even something more? The what-ifs swirled in my head, making it hard to concentrate on anything else. I sighed and rubbed my temples, trying to clear my mind. It was time to move on and stop dwelling on something that was never meant to be. I took a deep breath and refocused on my work, determined to put the thoughts of her behind me. But just as I was starting to get into a rhythm, my phone buzzed with a notification. My heart skipped a beat as I saw her name pop up on the screen. She had messaged me after all."

"For a moment I debated calling from a blocked number. He was nice, but I still didn’t know him. But I figured it",was just as easy to block him later if he got creepy.

I took a deep breath and tried to calm my nerves, reminding myself that it was just a casual coffee date and not a marriage proposal. When he finally answered, his warm and friendly voice put me at ease, and I found myself smiling as I asked him if he'd like to grab coffee with me again sometime. There was a brief pause on the other end of the line, and for a moment, I worried that I had misread the situation entirely. But then he spoke up, his tone enthusiastic, and we started making plans for our next meeting. As we chatted, I felt a spark of excitement and anticipation that I hadn't experienced in a long time.

""Do you really believe that?"" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. Brad's gaze snapped back to mine, and he shrugged. ""I don't know, but it's definitely a possibility. Think about it, every person you've dated more than twice has ended up with someone else. It's like the universe is trying to tell you something."" I felt a surge of skepticism, but a part of me couldn't shake off the feeling that there was some truth to his words. Was I really cosmically destined to be alone? The thought sent a pang of sadness through me, but I pushed it aside, determined to prove Brad wrong. I was going to find someone, someone who was meant for me, no matter what the universe had in store."

We could do anything we want, go anywhere we want. The possibilities would be endless. And all we have to do is hang out a few times and see if we can make it happen. It's a no-brainer, if you ask me. So, what do you say? Are you in?"

But at the same time, I recalled the moments of tenderness, the way she had held me close when I was sick or scared, and the sacrifices she had made for our family. It was a tangled web of emotions, and I wasn't sure how to untangle it. As I stood there, trying to process my feelings, I couldn't help but wonder if things would ever change between us."

It was as if she'd vanished into thin air. I'd been pacing the apartment for hours, trying to shake the feeling of unease that had settled in the pit of my stomach. I'd checked her social media, but there was nothing. No posts, no messages, no activity. It was as if she'd been erased. I'd tried to distract myself with work, but my mind kept wandering back to Amber. Where was she? What was she doing? Was she okay? The questions swirled in my head, refusing to let me focus. I knew I had to do something, but I didn't know what. I felt helpless, stuck in a state of limbo, waiting for some sign, some indication that Amber was still out there, still alive."

As we made our way down the worn wooden planks, the creaking of the boards beneath our feet was like music to my ears, a symphony of memories that I thought were long forgotten. The beach was our happy place, where worries were washed away with the tide, and all that was left was the warmth of the sun on our skin and the love that we shared as a family."

I grew up walking on eggshells, never knowing which version of my mother I would encounter from one day to the next. As a child, I struggled to understand why she couldn't just be happy all the time, why she couldn't just be the queen I so desperately wanted her to be. But as I grew older, I began to realize that my mother's struggles were not just her own, but a product of the world around her, a world that often seemed determined to bring her down. And I began to see that my role in her life was not just to be her child, but to be her rock, her confidant, and her safe haven."

I remembered her smile, her laugh, the way she used to read me stories before bed. Those memories were etched in my mind like scars, a constant reminder of what I had lost. Maddy's moms tried to fill the void, but it was like trying to put a square peg in a round hole - it just didn't fit. I loved them, in my own way, but it was a different kind of love. A love born of gratitude and respect, rather than blood and instinct. I knew they wanted more, but I just couldn't give it to them. And so we existed in this limbo, a family of sorts, but not quite. Maddy, their biological daughter, was the glue that held us together. She was the reason I stayed, the reason I tried to make it work. But even she couldn't bridge the gap between me and her moms. That gap was too wide, too deep. It was a chasm that seemed insurmountable, a constant reminder that I would never truly be a part of their family."

I decided to occupy myself by making some coffee and catching up on the news. As I scrolled through my phone, I stumbled upon an article about a new art exhibit in town. I had been meaning to check it out, and now seemed like the perfect opportunity. I quickly got dressed and headed out, hoping to clear my mind and find some inspiration. The exhibit was even more breathtaking than I had expected, and I found myself lost in the vibrant colors and thought-provoking installations. As I wandered through the galleries, I couldn't help but think about Maddy and her date. I wondered if they were having a good time, and if she was feeling the same way about him as I had felt about my own crush just a few days ago. I pushed the thoughts aside and focused on the art, letting the creativity and beauty wash over me. After a few hours, I felt rejuvenated and ready to take on the day. I made my way back home, looking forward to hearing all about Maddy's date and sharing my own adventures with her. "

As I sat there, I couldn't help but think about how fast time had flown by - it seemed like just yesterday I was dropping her off for her first day of kindergarten. Now, she was a confident and independent teenager, navigating the ups and downs of high school with ease. I watched as students chatted and laughed with each other, exchanging stories about their day, and I felt a sense of nostalgia wash over me. Before I knew it, my daughter appeared at the door, her bright smile lighting up the afternoon. She tossed her backpack into the trunk and slid into the passenger seat, giving me a quick kiss on the cheek before buckling up. ""Hey, Mom, how was your day?"" she asked, already knowing the answer.

I had plans to spend my free time reading and exploring the woods behind our house, something I had been looking forward to for weeks. But as I turned to head home, I noticed a girl standing by the entrance of the school, looking lost and uncertain. She had a look of desperation in her eyes, and I felt a sudden urge to go over and talk to her. Little did I know, this chance encounter would change everything."

As I turned it and pulled the door open, a faint whisper stopped me. “Hey,” she said, her voice barely audible. I turned back, my eyes meeting hers in a fleeting glance. For a moment, we just looked at each other, the air thick with unspoken words. Then I turned and walked out, the door closing behind me with a soft click."

Sarah led us inside, where we were greeted by the cozy atmosphere of a crackling fireplace and the aroma of freshly baked cookies wafting from the kitchen. She showed us to our room, a quaint space with a plush queen-sized bed and a private balcony overlooking the rolling hills of the countryside. As we settled in, Sarah offered to bring us some refreshments, and we gladly accepted, feeling grateful for the warm hospitality and eager to explore the surrounding area."

Suddenly, a faint rumble of thunder echoed through the air, and Maddy turned to me with a look of excitement. “I think we're in for a storm,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. I nodded in agreement, feeling a thrill of anticipation run through me. There was something about the prospect of a storm that always left me feeling invigorated, as if the turmoil in the air was a reflection of the turmoil that often churned inside me."

""Okay, let's see...it says here that you have a high percentage of European ancestry, with a small amount of Asian and African DNA mixed in.

Maddy's eyes sparkled with excitement as she continued to scan the results. ""I think I see something here...yes, it looks like you have a possible match. A second cousin, maybe? The connection is pretty strong, so it's definitely worth investigating further."" Emily's eyes widened as she leaned in to take a closer look at the screen. ""What's their name?"" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. Maddy's fingers flew across the keyboard as she worked to uncover more information.

It was a family heirloom, passed down from her grandmother, and the thought of losing it was unbearable. She rummaged deeper, her anxiety growing with each passing moment, as the sounds of the bustling street outside seemed to fade into the background. Suddenly, her fingers closed around the familiar shape, and she let out a sigh of relief as she pulled it out, the locket glinting in the faint light of the streetlamp above."
Maddy was already off the pontoon and running toward me across the beach. She skidded to,"a halt in front of me, still catching her breath from the sprint. “This bitch,” she managed.","stop in front of me, her eyes wide with excitement, and a huge grin spreading across her face.",33,"stop in front of me, her eyes wide with excitement, and a huge grin spreading across her face. ""What is it?"" I asked, but she just shook her head and grabbed my arm, pulling me toward the water's edge. The sun was setting over the ocean, casting a golden glow over the waves, and I could see the outline of a small boat bobbing gently in the distance. Maddy was still pulling me along, and I stumbled after her, my feet sinking into the cool sand. As we reached the water's edge, I saw that the boat was closer than I had thought, and I could make out the figure of a person sitting in the stern, their face obscured by a hoodie. Maddy let out a squeal of delight and waved wildly at the boat, and the person slowly raised a hand in response. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized that this must be the mysterious stranger we had been expecting, and I wondered what they wanted with us."
"Amber was in a flowing white-and-peach chiffon summer dress with a slit up the thigh. Her long brown hair was down, she had on a floppy wide-brimmed hat and huge sunglasses. She was carrying","a bottle of champagne in one hand and her sandals in the other, dangling off the tips of her fingers. She was beaming, running toward us across the beach, kicking up sand. “Emma!” She laughed.","a large straw tote bag and her feet were clad in a pair of neutral-colored sandals that added a touch of elegance to her overall bohemian look.

As she walked along the beach, the warm breeze danced through her hair, and the sunlight caught the subtle shimmer of her dress, making her appear almost ethereal. The sound of the waves gently lapping at the shore created a soothing melody that seemed to match the rhythm of her steps. She moved with a carefree air, her smile radiant as she breathed in the salty air, feeling the stress and tension of her daily life slowly ebb away with each wave. The beach was relatively empty, save for a few scattered sunbathers and children building sandcastles in the distance, which only added to the sense of tranquility that enveloped her. As she continued her leisurely stroll, Amber felt her thoughts begin to untangle, her mind clearing like the horizon after a storm. She closed her eyes, letting the warmth of the sun seep into her skin, and allowed herself to simply be, letting go of all her worries and concerns, if only for this one perfect moment."
"“Emma, you won’t believe my day,” she said, looking back at me. “So I wanted to surprise you. I flew all the way over here on","a red-eye, got an Uber, and came out to the address you gave me, but when I knocked on the door this handsome man answered instead.”","a whim, just to see the look on your face when I show up at your doorstep.

I have to admit, it's been far too long since we've had a chance to catch up in person. I was starting to think that life had gotten in the way and we'd never find the time. But I just couldn't shake the feeling that I needed to see you, to talk to you about everything that's been going on. And then, of course, there's the surprise I have for you - the real reason I'm here. I think you'll be just as shocked as I was when I found out. Are you ready to hear it?"
“Are you kidding me with this?” Maddy hissed as soon as they were out,of earshot. “She’s here for what? Six hours? And she’s already hypnotized our landlord?”,"of the principal's office, her voice barely above a whisper but laced with venom. She spun",28,"of the principal's office, her voice barely above a whisper but laced with venom. She spun around to face Jake, her eyes blazing with a mix of anger and incredulity. ""You're telling me that after all these years, after everything we've been through, you're just going to up and leave without even discussing it with me?"" She took a step closer to him, her fists clenched at her sides. ""What about our plans? What about college? What about everything we've talked about since freshman year?"" Jake shifted uncomfortably, avoiding eye contact as he mumbled something under his breath. Maddy's eyes narrowed. ""What was that? I didn't quite catch it."" Her tone was icy, daring him to try and brush her off. Jake sighed, rubbing the back of his neck before meeting her gaze. ""I said, I don't know, okay? I just know I have to get out of here."" Maddy's expression turned skeptical. ""Get out of here? What's going on, Jake? You're starting to scare me."""
Maddy crossed her arms. “What she always does? Show up and leave a path of,"destruction in her wake? She’s not staying with us,” she said in her end-of-discussion voice.","destruction in her wake?

And yet, despite all the drama she brings, my mom still insists on inviting her over for holidays and special occasions. I just don't get it. Can't we just have one peaceful family gathering without her drama? I glanced over at my mom, who was busy setting the table, a look of determination on her face. I knew that look all too well - it was the same look she got whenever she was trying to prove a point. I sighed and shook my head, wondering what other surprises the day might bring."
Maddy rolled her eyes in the way that I knew meant she was aware. “Please tell me I don’t have to stay and watch,you eat crustaceans with that woman. Let’s just go back to the island and you see her tomorrow or something when she’s done with what’s-his-face.”,"the rest of this train wreck,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper, as if she feared being overheard by the other patrons of the dimly lit coffee",49,"the rest of this train wreck,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper, as if she feared being overheard by the other patrons of the dimly lit coffee shop. I shook my head, trying to stifle a grin at her dramatics, but she just raised an eyebrow and continued, ""I mean, seriously, how many times can one person mess up a simple coffee order?"" The barista, a harried-looking young woman with a pierced nose and a name tag that read ""Luna,"" looked like she was on the verge of tears as she tried to explain to the customer, a middle-aged man with a condescending smirk, that no, they didn't have any ""half-caf, half-decaf, iced, quad-shot, mocha-choca-latte with room for cream"" left, and that maybe he could just, I don't know, try a different drink? Maddy snorted in disgust and turned back to me, ""I swear, some people's children."" I chuckled and leaned in, ""Well, at least it's entertaining,"" I whispered, and Maddy rolled her eyes again, this time with a hint of a smile."
I watched him walk to the beach and I let out a long breath. Maddy was right.,"This was bad. Mom never left anywhere on good terms. Not jobs, or apartments, or relationships. Especially relationships.","He needed some time alone, and I couldn't blame him. The past few days had been overwhelming, and the tension between us was",35,"He needed some time alone, and I couldn't blame him. The past few days had been overwhelming, and the tension between us was palpable. I decided to give him some space and went back inside to help Maddy with the dishes. As I scrubbed the last of the plates, I couldn't help but think about the argument we had earlier. It was a stupid fight, but it had brought up some deeper issues that we needed to address. I hoped that once he cooled off, we could talk things through and move forward. The sound of the waves crashing outside was soothing, and I found myself lost in thought, wondering what the future held for us. Just then, Maddy broke the silence, ""You okay?"" she asked, concern etched on her face. I nodded, forcing a smile, ""Yeah, I'm fine. Just worried about him."" Maddy nodded understandingly and put a reassuring hand on my shoulder. ""He'll be okay, he just needs some time to process everything."" I nodded, hoping she was right."
I felt relieved the instant he said he would stay with me because it let Maddy off the hook. She would walk through hell for,me—and this cookout was her hell. I was glad she didn’t have to be here.

I was grateful that she wouldn't have to do that now. As we walked to the car, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions - anxiety about what the doctor would say, but also a sense of relief that I wouldn't be alone. The drive to the hospital was quiet, with only the sound of the radio breaking the silence. I stared out the window, watching as the buildings and houses passed by in a blur. I was lost in my thoughts, trying to prepare myself for what was to come. When we arrived at the hospital, he helped me out of the car and we made our way to the emergency room. The waiting room was crowded and noisy, filled with people of all ages, each with their own story and reason for being there. We found a couple of empty chairs and sat down, waiting for my name to be called. The minutes ticked by slowly, each one feeling like an eternity. I fidgeted with my hands, trying to distract myself from the anxiety that was building up inside me. He noticed and put a reassuring hand on my shoulder, giving it a gentle squeeze. I looked up at him and smiled weakly, feeling a sense of gratitude towards him. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, my name was called and we stood up, making our way to the examination room. The doctor was friendly and kind, with a warm smile that put me at ease. He asked me a series of questions, taking notes as I answered. I tried to remember every detail, no matter how small it seemed. When I finished, he nodded thoughtfully and began the examination. I closed my eyes, trying to relax as he poked and prodded, searching for any signs of what could be wrong. The silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the sound of his scribbling on his notepad. I opened my eyes to find him looking at me with a serious expression, his eyes filled with a deep concern. My heart sank, and I felt a wave of fear wash over me. What was wrong with me? What had he found? I swallowed hard, trying to prepare myself for the worst. He took a deep breath before speaking, his words hanging in the air like a challenge. ""We need to run some tests,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""But I think we may have found the problem."" I felt a surge of hope mixed with fear, my mind racing with possibilities. What did he mean? What had they found? I looked at him, my eyes searching for answers, but he just smiled reassuringly and patted my hand. ""Don't worry,"" he said. ""We'll get to the bottom of this. I promise."" I nodded, trying to believe him, trying to trust that everything would be okay. But as I lay there, waiting for the tests to begin, I couldn't shake the feeling that my life was about to change in ways I couldn't even imagine."
"“Thanks.” I looked back at the lake, at Maddy fading into",the distance on the pontoon. “And thanks for pushing her off.”,"the distance, her blonde hair a bright spot against the dull green",22,"the distance, her blonde hair a bright spot against the dull green of the trees. I felt a pang of guilt for not being more supportive, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about the whole situation. The water lapped gently against the shore, a soothing sound that seemed to wash away my worries, but only for a moment. As I turned to follow Maddy, I caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of my eye - a flash of movement, a shadowy figure lurking just beyond the trees. I spun around, but there was no one there. I must have imagined it, I told myself, but the feeling of being watched lingered, making the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end."
"Maddy had been right about his height. He was probably about six-one. He was on the leaner side, but",toned.

As he moved closer, she noticed the way his eyes crinkled at the corners, and the small scar above his left eyebrow, which only added to his allure. Despite his rough exterior, there was something about him that seemed kind and genuine, and she found herself wanting to know more about this mysterious stranger."
"“He’ll probably completely forget we even exist,” she mumbled, resting her head on","the cushion. “Amber has a way of making people do that,” she said tiredly.","the edge of the couch, her eyes drifting towards the old photograph on the",27,"the edge of the couch, her eyes drifting towards the old photograph on the mantle, a faded memory of happier times when their father was still around, his warm smile and gentle laughter now nothing more than a distant recollection, a bittersweet reminder of what they had lost, and as she gazed at the picture, she couldn't help but wonder if he would ever come back to them, or if they would be forever stuck in this limbo, waiting for a reunion that might never happen."
"Now I blew out a long breath. “Well, she’s funny. Hardworking. She reads any book she can get her hands on and she remembers everything she reads, even years later. She had me really","young.

And she's got this quirky way of looking at the world that's just infectious. I found myself seeing things from her perspective, even when I didn't agree with her. But what really got me was the way she cared about people - not just her friends and family, but everyone she met. She had this empathy that was just remarkable. I'd watch her talk to strangers and within minutes, they'd be opening up to her like they'd known her for years. It was like she had this gift for understanding what made people tick. And despite all her strengths, she was humble, never seeking to draw attention to herself. I think that's what drew me to her the most - she was this incredible, multifaceted person who didn't even realize how amazing she was."
"When I got back to the cottage an hour later, Maddy was in the screened-in porch, reading. She","wore shorts and flip-flops, and she was drinking a beer.

The tension in my shoulders began to ease as I gazed out at the tranquil scene before us - the sun-dappled trees swaying gently in the breeze, the sound of birdsong filling the air. Maddy closed her book and set it aside, her eyes never leaving mine. ""How was your walk?"" she asked, her voice low and soothing. I hesitated, unsure of how much to share, but something in her expression put me at ease, and I found myself opening up to her in a way I never had with anyone before."

The faded photograph of her grandparents, the handmade quilt from her aunt, and the dog-eared copy of her favorite childhood book – these were the things that brought her joy, that told the story of who she was and where she came from. The rest, she realized, was just stuff."

As they walked further away from the factory, the smell slowly started to fade, replaced by the sweet scent of blooming flowers and fresh cut grass. The contrast was striking, a reminder of the beauty that could thrive even in the most unexpected places. The two friends continued on their way, enjoying the warm sun on their skin and the sound of birds chirping in the distance."
He grinned back and forth between us. “Maybe we can get together for dinner later this,"week, once you’ve gotten settled in,” he said. “Amber and I would love to have you.”","week and discuss the details of the project further,"" he suggested, his eyes sparkling",32,"week and discuss the details of the project further,"" he suggested, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm as he pulled out a small notebook from his pocket and began to scribble down his phone number.

As I watched him walk away, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. The possibility of working with him on this project was starting to look more and more promising, and I found myself wondering what other surprises lay in store. I tucked the piece of paper into my pocket and made my way back to my office, my mind already racing with ideas and possibilities."
It was never going to happen. I knew this. But Maddy wouldn’t let it go unless,"I tried—and really, I should try. Maddy was right, this whole situation was a ticking time bomb.","she had exhausted every last possibility, and so I found myself agreeing to meet her at the old café",33,"she had exhausted every last possibility, and so I found myself agreeing to meet her at the old café on the outskirts of town, the one with the faded sign and the perpetually empty tables.

Maddy was already there, sipping on a cup of black coffee, her eyes fixed intently on me as I slid into the booth across from her. ""So,"" she said, her voice low and determined, ""I've been thinking."" I raised an eyebrow, knowing that tone, knowing that look, and I steeled myself for what was to come."
"I paused, not sure how much I wanted to share. I decided on all of it.

I told her about the strange occurrences, the unexplained noises, and the creeping sense of dread that had been following me for weeks. I told her about the research I had done, the books I had read, and the theories I had formed. And I told her about the fear that had been growing inside me, the fear that I was losing my mind. Emma listened, her expression unreadable, as I poured out my heart and soul to her. When I finally finished, she sat in silence for a moment, her eyes fixed on mine. Then, to my surprise, she reached out and took my hand, her touch warm and comforting. ""We'll figure this out together,"" she said, her voice soft and reassuring. ""We'll get to the bottom of this, no matter what it takes."""

And as I sat there, I felt a sense of gratitude for the opportunity to be in her presence, to learn from her and be inspired by her courage and determination. The more I watched her, the more I realized that she was a true survivor, a warrior who had faced her demons and come out on top. And in that moment, I knew that I wanted to be more like her, to embody the same strength and resilience that she had. I wanted to be able to face my own challenges with the same courage and determination, to be able to trust and be trusted, to love and be loved.

My heart is racing at the mere thought of it, but I feel like I have to try. I've had feelings for her for so long, and I don't want to regret not taking the chance to express them. I'll just have to wait and see what happens, but I have a feeling that tonight could be the start of something special."
I’d tried to be softer with her the last few days. The energy shift I’d had over Mom after my talk with Emma,"was almost as bad as being mad at her.

My sister, Rachel, had even commented on it, saying I seemed more relaxed, more like my old self. I hoped it would last, that I could keep this newfound sense of calm and empathy going, even when things got tough again. And they would get tough again, I was sure of it. But for now, I was just going to enjoy the peace and quiet, and the feeling of being able to breathe a little deeper."
"This was another thing I was trying not to think about—her leaving. I should be happy that she came at all, that she wasn’t in Hawaii.

I could take her on a romantic getaway, or plan a surprise picnic in the park. I could even try to cook her favorite meal, although I wasn't exactly the next Gordon Ramsay. The possibilities were endless, and I was determined to make the most of the time we had left. As I walked back to my car, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and nervousness. I was excited to see her again, to spend more time with her, but I was also nervous about the possibility of her leaving. What if I couldn't convince her to stay? What if she had already made up her mind? I pushed the thoughts aside and focused on the present moment. I had three more dates, and I was going to make the most of them. I was going to be charming, witty, and romantic. I was going to show her that I was the perfect guy for her. And who knows, maybe she would fall in love with me, and decide to stay. A guy could dream, right?"

As she munched away, she couldn't help but think about the reason for their trip, and the uncertainty that lay ahead. The silence between them was palpable, and Emma wondered if Ryan was thinking the same thing. She glanced over at him, but his expression was unreadable, his jaw set in a firm line. The GPS announced their exit, and Ryan slowed down, navigating the car onto the ramp. Emma's stomach did a flip as she realized they were getting close to their destination."
"I think I would have been embarrassed if I’d been on a date with anyone else. My mother, sobbing drunk the night before",she left for prison. But I knew Emma didn’t judge.

Emma's thoughts, however, remained with the young woman who had just broken down, her words still echoing in Emma's mind like a haunting refrain. She felt a pang of empathy, remembering the countless times she had found herself in similar situations, struggling to hold it together in the face of overwhelming emotion. As she sat there, lost in thought, Emma became aware of a gentle touch on her shoulder, and she turned to find her colleague, Rachel, offering a sympathetic smile and a concerned glance."
It was funny that two pivotal moments in my life were happening at the exact same time and at complete odds with each,other.

As I sat in my small apartment, surrounded by half-packed boxes and memories of a life I was about to leave behind, I couldn't help but wonder how two such significant events could be happening simultaneously. It was as if the universe was testing my ability to multitask, to balance the excitement of new beginnings with the sorrow of endings. I thought back to all the times my partner and I had talked about our future, about the life we would build together after graduation. Now, it seemed like those conversations had been nothing more than a distant dream, a fantasy we had both been too afraid to wake up from. As I looked around my cluttered room, I realized that I had a choice to make: I could let the heartbreak consume me, or I could use it as fuel to propel myself forward into this new chapter of my life. The question was, which path would I choose?"
"What did I have to offer her? I had nothing but baggage. Emotionally damaged, traumatized children that had been catapulted from one tragedy to the next, and me, barely keeping my head above water. Would I even have the time or the bandwidth to be any kind of partner while I was helping my",siblings navigate this situation?

I felt like I was drowning in my own emotions, and the thought of taking on someone else's was overwhelming. But as I looked into her eyes, I saw something there that gave me pause. It was a deep kindness, a sense of understanding that seemed to see right through to my very soul. She didn't seem to care about my baggage, or at least, she didn't seem to be intimidated by it. In fact, she seemed to be drawn to it, like a moth to a flame. And as I stood there, frozen in uncertainty, she reached out and took my hand, her touch sending a spark of electricity through my entire body. It was a small gesture, but it spoke volumes. She was willing to take a chance on me, baggage and all. And in that moment, I felt a glimmer of hope that I hadn't felt in a long time. Maybe, just maybe, I wasn't too broken to be loved. Maybe I wasn't too damaged to be whole again. The thought was both exhilarating and terrifying, but as I looked into her eyes, I knew that I was willing to take the risk. I was willing to let her in, to let her see the real me, scars and all. And as I did, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders, a weight that I had been carrying for far too long. It was a weight that I thought I would never be able to put down, but with her by my side, I felt like I could finally breathe again. I felt like I could finally be myself, without fear of judgment or rejection. And as we stood there, hands entwined, I knew that I had found something special. I had found someone who saw me, truly saw me, and loved me anyway. And in that moment, I knew that I would do anything to hold onto that feeling, to hold onto her."
Sarah gave him a look. “Maybe for you. Hanging out with my brother,isn’t my idea of a good time. I’ll be outside. I want to go.”,"isn't exactly my idea of a good time, especially when he's in",27,"isn't exactly my idea of a good time, especially when he's in one of his moods. I swear, sometimes I think he forgets that I'm his sister, not one of his employees. The way he barks orders at me, like I'm some kind of personal assistant, really gets under my skin. And don't even get me started on how he always thinks he knows what's best for me, like I'm not capable of making my own decisions. I love him, of course, but sometimes I wish he'd just back off and let me live my own life."

And don't, I repeat, DO NOT mention the fact that you've been practicing your 'I'm a functioning adult' face in the mirror for the past hour. Just be normal, Emma. Is that too much to ask? And, for goodness' sake, don't trip on your own feet. I don't think my nerves can take it. Oh, and one more thing, try to remember that his name is Alexander, not 'that guy with the chiseled jawline and piercing blue eyes'. I know it's a lot to ask, but I have faith in you. Now, go out there and make me proud! Or, at the very least, don't make me want to pull my hair out in frustration. Emma, go! Now!"
“So he would come home and see you there. Or because she was bored,"and lonely. FYI, Amber only ever calls you when it serves Amber,” she said.","and looking for someone to talk to, she would often initiate conversations with",28,"and looking for someone to talk to, she would often initiate conversations with him, asking about his day and listening intently to his responses, which sometimes led to interesting discussions and debates that would last for hours, filling the silence of the house with the sound of their voices and the occasional clinking of tea cups as they sipped their tea and got lost in their own little world, a world that was full of ideas and imagination, where they could be themselves without fear of judgment or rejection, a world that was their own secret sanctuary, hidden from the prying eyes of the outside world."
"I always thought it was a proximity thing. She traveled a lot, she changed jobs all the time, she was busy, she","was dealing with whatever Amber dealt with. But now I couldn’t rationalize why nothing was different, even though she was right here.","had a million excuses for why we couldn't meet up, and I always assumed it was just because our lives were taking us in different directions.",44,"had a million excuses for why we couldn't meet up, and I always assumed it was just because our lives were taking us in different directions. But the truth is, I think she was avoiding me. I think she was avoiding the awkwardness that came with our complicated history. We had been friends since childhood, but after that one summer, everything changed. The way she looked at me, the way I looked at her, it was all different. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but I knew that things would never be the same again. And I think she knew it too, which is why she kept her distance. But despite the distance, despite the time and space between us, I couldn't help but feel a pang of longing whenever I thought of her. I wondered what could have been if things had gone differently, if we had taken a different path. I wondered if she ever thought about it too, or if I was just a distant memory to her, a relic of a past life."
He nodded over his shoulder. “I should probably let you get back to work. I have to go pick,"up Alex and take him to a doctor’s appointment.” He paused. “Am I allowed to hug you goodbye, or…?”",up my sister from the airport.

I'm hoping it's not something more serious, but at the same time, I just want to know what's going on so we can all start feeling better. I suggested we all go see a doctor, but Sarah just shook her head and said she's too tired to even think about it right now. I'm getting a little worried, to be honest."
I took her hand and did my best to make my face straight. People were already stopping to watch. I made,"my voice low so only she could hear it. “Emma, would you do me the honor of delousing my family with me?”","myself look as calm as possible, trying not to draw any more attention to us.

The crowd was growing larger, and I knew we had to get out of there before things escalated. I spotted a small alleyway to our left and gently pulled her towards it, hoping to lose the onlookers in the narrow passage. As we walked, the sounds of the crowd grew fainter, and I could feel her grip on my hand relax slightly. I glanced down at her, trying to read her expression, but her eyes were fixed on the ground ahead. I knew I had to say something, to reassure her that everything was going to be okay, but the words caught in my throat. We walked in silence for what felt like an eternity, the only sound being the soft thud of our footsteps on the pavement."
"“She’ll be home one day, Sarah. It’ll come faster than you think. You can visit her and write to her and call her.","You can stay close to her—you just have to try.

I'm so glad Dad finally agreed to take me; I was starting to think I was going to have to wait until I was 18. I've already told all my friends at school, and they're all super jealous. I feel like the luckiest person alive right now."
"In that moment, maybe for the first time ever for me, she looked like a little",girl. She was a little girl. I recognized the mask Sarah wore for what it was.,"girl, not the strong and independent woman I had grown accustomed to. Her eyes,",32,"girl, not the strong and independent woman I had grown accustomed to. Her eyes, usually bright and full of life, seemed dull and lost, and her shoulders slumped in defeat. I felt a pang in my chest as I realized that I had never seen her so vulnerable before. It was as if the weight of the world had finally caught up with her, and she was struggling to keep her head above water. I wanted to reach out and comfort her, to tell her that everything would be okay, but something held me back. Maybe it was the fear of being rejected, or maybe it was the uncertainty of how she would react. Whatever the reason, I stood there frozen, unsure of what to do next."

The smell of citronella and freshly cut grass filled the air, and the sound of crickets provided a soothing background noise. As we ate, we talked about our day, sharing stories and laughter. After dinner, we decided to have a movie night under the stars. I set up the projector and screen, and we picked a movie to watch. The night was perfect, with a clear sky and a gentle breeze. We snuggled up under the blanket, feeling grateful for the simple pleasures in life. As the movie played, we occasionally glanced up at the stars, feeling connected to the vastness of the universe. It was a night to remember, a night that would be etched in our memories forever."
"“I’m a surgeon, Amber. I don’t have a nine-to-five, I stay until","it’s done, I can’t answer the phone in the middle of an appendectomy—”","the job is done, no matter how long it takes.

I've even been known to pull a 36-hour shift when things get really crazy. But that's just the way it is when you're a surgeon. You can't just leave in the middle of an operation because your shift is over. You have to see it through to the end, no matter what. And that's what I love about my job - the unpredictability, the challenge, the sense of satisfaction when it's all over and I know I've made a difference in someone's life. But it's not always easy, and it's definitely not for the faint of heart. There are days when I feel like I'm running on empty, when the stress and the pressure get to me and I wonder how I'll make it through another day. But then I think about why I became a surgeon in the first place - to help people, to make a difference - and that's what keeps me going."

We had been practicing for weeks, but he just couldn't seem to get the hang of it. I sighed inwardly, knowing that I would have to take the wheel if we were going to make it to our destination on time. I turned back to the others, who were all looking at me expectantly. ""Alright, let's get moving,"" I said, trying to sound calmer than I felt. ""We've got a long way to go, and not a lot of time to waste."""

I tried to focus on the question, but my mind was a jumbled mess of emotions and sensations. ""Uh, it leaves in a few hours,"" I managed to stammer, my voice barely above a whisper. He nodded, his eyes locked on mine, and I felt like he could see right through me. The air was thick with tension as he slowly withdrew his hand, his fingers grazing my skin one last time before he pulled away. I let out a shaky breath, trying to process what had just happened. We were standing in the middle of a crowded airport, surrounded by people rushing to catch their flights, but it felt like we were the only two people in the world."

My mom was expertly flipping pancakes at the stove, while my dad was setting the table. My little sister, Emily, was sitting at the counter, munching on a piece of toast and watching the chaos with wide eyes. I took a deep breath, feeling a sense of relief wash over me. It was going to be a good day. I poured myself a glass of orange juice and slid onto the stool next to Emily, who grinned up at me and said, ""Morning, sleepyhead!"" I smiled back and ruffled her hair, feeling a sense of normalcy that I hadn't experienced in a long time. As we sat down to eat, my mom asked about our plans for the day, and I realized that I had completely forgotten that it was Saturday. No school, no work, just a whole day stretching out before us like a blank canvas. I felt a thrill of excitement at the possibilities. What would we do today? Go to the park? See a movie? Just hang out at home and be lazy? The options were endless, and I couldn't wait to find out what the day had in store."
