"Over the last three years, Peter dusted off Our Story every chance he got.",I was sure he’d work it into both our vows and his wedding reception speech.,"He read it to his children, his friends, and even his colleagues at work.

"When I jolted awake at the click of the front door, it was full","bright in the living room, so I could see Peter’s surprise at finding me there.","dark outside, and I could hear the distant hum of crickets and the occasional bark of a dog. I lay there for a moment, trying to shake off the remnants of the dream, but it lingered in my mind like a faint scent.

"I stayed there watching the road for probably ten minutes. Then I went back inside and cried so hard it might’ve made me vomit, if I hadn’t completely forgotten to eat the","night before. I wasn’t much of a cook, and besides that, Peter was extremely careful with his diet. Low carbs, high protein. I dug around our understocked cabinets and started making Easy Mac.","entire day, and my stomach was as empty as my heart felt. I collapsed onto the couch, surrounded by the silence of my apartment, and let the tears consume"
"Fool that I am, my only guess was that Peter had come back. That he’d made",it to the airport only for a burst of clarity to send him racing home to me.,"his way back to me, that he'd found a way to escape the darkness that had consumed him. I felt a surge of hope, of excitement, as I rushed to the door and flung it open. But it wasn't Peter who stood on my porch, his eyes gleaming with a mixture of sadness and determination. It was a stranger, a man I'd never seen before, with a look of quiet resolve etched on his face."
"Then Peter and I moved into the Waning Bay house, with its wraparound porch. That day, he scooped me","into his arms, carried me over the threshold, and said three magic words that changed my little minimalist heart forever.","up in his arms and carried me across the threshold, both of us laughing and crying at the same time. We spent the rest of the day unpacking and settling in, our excitement and exhaustion mingling together like the salty sea air and the scent of fresh paint. As the sun began to set, we sat on the porch, watching the stars twinkle to life above, and I knew that this was where I was meant to be – in this house, with this man"
"Somehow, the kids manage even more enthusiasm for tacos than they did for dragons. When I ask if they already knew that dragons","love tacos, their shrieks of delight are earsplitting.

Tacos! Tacos!"""
"Just as I predicted, the energy that greeted me has fizzled, the kids mostly settling into pleasant sleepiness in time to pack it in and head home, except","for one of the Fontana triplets, who’s tired enough to devolve into a minor meltdown as her mom is trying to get her and her siblings out the door.","for a few stragglers who insisted on getting in one last game of tag, their shrieks of laughter and shouts of excitement lingering in the air as the rest of the partygoers made their way out the door, exhausted but content, with big smiles on their faces and memories to last a lifetime."

"By the time I climb the stairs and reach the front door, I’m clammy with sweat, and inside I drop my tote and wrestle out of my cardigan before toeing off my loafers. Then I check my phone calendar","against the whiteboard. The only thing that’s changed since last night is, I agreed to host the Thrills and Kills book club on Thursday while Landon, the patron services assistant who usually runs it, recovers from his root canal.","and see that I have a meeting with my boss in 15 minutes, so I quickly grab a glass of water from the kitchen and head to the living room to collect my thoughts before the call."
"The worst part is, even after all this, I’m not positive I don’t love him. I mean, not this version of him, but the part that remembered every important date,","who brought home flowers just because he happened to be walking past a cart selling them, the Peter who had my favorite soup delivered to me every time I got sick.","that knew exactly what to say to make me feel better, that could make me laugh on my worst days. It's like he's still in there, trapped beneath the surface, and I keep hoping that one day he'll break free and be the man I fell in love with again."

The weighty silence tells me Peter is doing invisible calculus now.
