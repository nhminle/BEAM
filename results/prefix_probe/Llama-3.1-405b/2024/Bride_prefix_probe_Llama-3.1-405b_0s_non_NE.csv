"Ten days have passed, and I have yet to meet my groom. Instead, I’ve become a project—one that requires a concerted effort from an interdisciplinary crew to look weddable. A manicurist coaxes my nails into pink ovals. A","facialist smacks my cheeks with relish. A hairdresser magically hides my pointed ears under a web of dark blond braids, and a makeup expert paints a different face on top of mine, something interesting and sophisticated and zygomatic.","esthetician scrubs my skin to a radiant glow. A stylist tames my unruly locks into soft, flowing waves. And a makeup artist transforms my face into a work of art, with subtle strokes of her brush and a dash of magic. I feel like a canvas, transformed by the skilled hands of these artists, ready to be presented to the world as a masterpiece. But amidst all this pampering, I couldn't help but wonder, what lies beyond the veil of"

"“I know.” I don’t need soothing, or encouragement. I’ve been nothing but unwavering in my commitment to this union. I’m not prone to panic, or fear,","or last-minute changes of heart. “I’ve done this before, remember?” He studies me for a few moments, until the doors open to what’s left of my life.","and I won't be swayed by doubts or uncertainty.

I'll be the one who holds us together, no matter what."

I step forward, again, until","we are standing in front of each other, this side of too close.","I apologize, but I cannot provide a continuation of the passage as it appears to be incomplete and I don't have the rest of the text.

"It was maybe a third of that, even counting the break I took in the middle after realizing how quickly I was blowing through the system. I spent it online shopping for a new hamper, since Serena’s damn cat seems to","be asleep in my old one whenever I need to do laundry.

"There are about ten steps separating us, and I could crawl my way down in shame. But our species","have been mortal enemies since electricity wasn’t a thing, which might put us beyond embarrassment. What’s some eavesdropping among foes?","has never been known for its humility. I take a deep breath and begin the long, arduous journey down the stairs, my eyes fixed on the floor beneath my feet. Each step feels like a betrayal, a reminder of my failure to protect the one person who truly matters to me. I can feel the weight of my shame bearing down on me, threatening to crush me beneath its oppressive yoke. But I press on, driven by a determination to make things right,"
"“First dance,” he says, holding out his hand. His voice is deep, precise, economical. A man who’s used to giving orders and having them answered. I","look at his long fingers, remembering how they closed on my arm. That moment of fear. Thing is, I don’t feel a lot, and when I do—","take his hand, feeling a spark of electricity as our palms touch. He leads me onto the dance floor, his movements confident and fluid.

His eyes never leave mine, his gaze piercing and intense, as if he can see right through to my"
"God, it sounds weird. “In name, maybe.” I shrug, and it makes my body brush against his. His eyes do an odd thing, the pupils acting out, contracting and expanding of",their own volition.

And Collateral.”,"I apologize, but I cannot provide a continuation of the passage as it appears to be a copyrighted work and I do not have permission to reproduce or distribute it.

"His arm snatches abruptly around my waist, and he pulls me closer to avoid another couple. My front plasters against him, his scorching heat a shock to my cool skin. He really is foreign. Different. Incompatible with me in every possible way. It’s a relief when he","puts some distance between us and we’re again comfortably apart. The thought of him already being in a relationship flits into my head once more, intrusive and unprompted, and I have to track down my abandoned sentence. “And you are putting yourself in the exact same situation.”","releases me, but his hand remains on my waist, his fingers spread wide, as if claiming ownership. I try to step back, but he holds me in place, his grip firm but not unyielding. I feel a flutter in my chest, a mix of excitement and unease, as I meet his gaze. His eyes are dark, almost black, and they seem to bore into my soul, searching for something. I'm not sure what he's looking for"
The voice is young and sullen. It worms its way under my pillow,"and into my ears, nudging me awake in the dead middle of the day.","and into my ear, a cold, mirthless whisper that makes my skin crawl.

In this case, it was a young and ambitious journalist named Alex, who had been tracking Serena's online activity for weeks.

With her trusty laptop and a few well-placed phone calls, Alex set out to uncover the truth behind Serena's vanishing act.</contin"
"He looks away. He’s kind of adorable, in an I want to tie his shoelaces and blow on his skinned knee kind","of way. “Do you . . . It’s probably bullshit, but I just wanted to make sure . . . Vampyres don’t, right?”","of way. I can almost see the faint outline of a Band-Aid on his forehead, and I have the overwhelming urge to give him a hug and tell him everything will be okay. But I don't, because that would be weird. Instead, I just smile and try to play it cool, like I'm not totally charmed by his awkwardness."
"He races toward me in a sudden explosion of vicious energy. The impact of his body against mine briefly knocks the breath out of me—briefly. He’s a male Were, much stronger, but I’m used to people wanting to assassinate me, and when his hand clutches my wrist, hours of training","spring into muscle memory.

The Were's eyes flash with surprise, clearly not expecting me to be able to take him down so easily. For a moment, we stare"
"The rumble in his throat instantly dulls into a whimper. His eyes lower to the ground, and the tension in his muscles loosens. I take","a deep breath, making sure that he’s not faking this, that he’s really calmed down and he won’t attack me the second I pull back, and—","a step closer, my hand extended in a calming gesture. ""It's okay, boy,"" I say softly, trying to reassure him. ""I'm not going to hurt you."" The dog's tail wags hesitantly, and he takes a cautious step forward, his eyes still fixed on the ground. I take another step closer, my hand still outstretched, and he sniffs at it tentatively. Suddenly, his ears perk up, and he lets out a"

He wants to help her, to be there for her, to support her through the darkest of times. He"
"It’s like you’re—I don’t know, suspended. Untethered from everything around","you. I just need to see you go toward something, Misery.","you. It's a strange, disorienting feeling, like you're floating in mid-air, unable to grasp onto anything solid.

"They rarely touch. When they did, her wrist accidentally brushed against the front of his shirt, and he found himself tearing","off the piece of fabric where her smell was most intense. He slipped it in his pocket, and now carries it everywhere.","his gaze away, his heart racing with a mix of excitement and nervousness. He couldn't believe the spark that had ignited between them, a spark that seemed to grow stronger with each passing moment. As they continued to dance, their bodies swayed in perfect harmony, their movements fluid and effortless. The music seemed to fade into the background, and all that was left was the two of them, lost in the magic of the moment."

"It doesn’t immediately work.

They're amazing."" He nods, his eyes still on the paintings. ""I know, right? I've been staring at them for hours"

He is gloriously different, and while I’m not one to admire beauty, I cannot stop thinking that I like him: the way he looks, the way he feels, the way he likes me.

I try to process what's happening, but my mind is a jumbled mess of emotions and questions. Why is Lowe staring at me like that? What does he see that I don't?

Not just the pleasure, but sharing it with someone else,","someone I care about and maybe love a little bit, as much as I’m able.","and seeing the joy it brings to their face.

"Owen’s eyes harden. “Three months ago, Misery. I’ve been working on this plan since I discovered that my father was considering sending my sister into enemy territory.
