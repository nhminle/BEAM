"Ten days have passed, and I have yet to meet my groom. Instead, I’ve become a project—one that requires a concerted effort from an interdisciplinary crew to look weddable.

"His arm snatches abruptly around my waist, and he pulls me closer to avoid another couple. My front plasters against him, his scorching heat a shock to my cool skin. He really is foreign. Different. Incompatible with me in every possible way. It’s a relief when he","puts some distance between us and we’re again comfortably apart.

"He races toward me in a sudden explosion of vicious energy. The impact of his body against mine briefly knocks the breath out of me—briefly.

I slip my shin between his knees and let my hand roam, curious, eager","to explore. He is gloriously different, and while I’m not one to admire beauty, I cannot stop thinking that I like him: the way he looks, the way he feels, the way he likes me.

It seems you are asking me to create explicit content.
"He is hard, but also soft, and doesn’t want much. He guides my hand up and down once, once more,","and beyond that, he has no instructions for me. My touch appears to be enough, just like the rest of me.",I can't help you with that.
"Whatever he needs, I want the same. One of his thighs wedges between mine, and I rub myself against it, vaguely embarrassed at the lewd, rhythmic sounds the contact makes, at the mess I’m making on him. But it feels good, too good to stop and good enough to forget, and then even better when his hand kneads my breasts, moves to","the small of my back to cant my hips, positioning me so that yes—there, “There.” I hum the word into his neck, around mouthfuls of blood. I’m shameless and dizzy and briefly happy, grinding and searching for pleasure like it’s something he has in store for me—not if, just when. I take one last drag, and swallow, and then ask, “Is this good?”",I can't help you with that.
"Lowe’s eyes stare unseeing into mine, and the fact that he seems too awestruck to be able","to speak, the choppy, uncoordinated way he tries to nod his pleasure, that’s what pushes me over.",I can't help you with this.
"It’s beautiful, I think. Not just the pleasure, but sharing it with someone else,","someone I care about and maybe love a little bit, as much as I’m able.","and feeling that connection, that intimacy, that sense of being alive together. It's a feeling that's hard to describe, but it's like our hearts are beating in sync, like we're two pieces of a puzzle that fit together perfectly. In that moment, nothing else matters, and all that's left is the thrill of the experience, the rush of emotions, and the knowledge that we're sharing it all with each other."
He’s saying my name like a prayer. Like I’m the one thing standing,between him and heaven on Earth. And that’s when I understand what he meant.,"between him and the darkness that’s consumed him. His voice is low and rough, like the rustle of dry leaves, and it sends shivers down my spine. I feel a flutter in my chest, a spark of hope that I thought had long been extinguished. He's saying my name like a prayer, like I'm the only one who can save him from the abyss that's swallowed him whole."

"Owen’s eyes harden. “Three months ago, Misery. I’ve been working on this plan since I discovered that my father was considering sending my sister into enemy territory. Again.” He bares his fangs, and his tone is uncharacteristically earnest. “I could do nothing when we were children. I could do nothing when you returned, because I was too much of a coward to take a stand. I cannot do anything","now, but I am determined to try.” His gaze fixes mine for a long moment, and he picks up in English again. “I want to be the one negotiating the next set of alliances. I want all Collateral systems gone. I want to stop enforcing artificial border lines, or holding on to disputed territories out of spite. I want to turn this place into something that’s not a powder keg.”","now, because I am still bound by the same chains of fear and doubt that have held me back for so long. But I can do this.

I would expect nothing less.,"I apologize, but I cannot provide a continuation of the passage as it appears to be a copyrighted work. Is there anything else I can help you with?"
"I might, too. Very soon. Especially as he moves with experimental, shallow thrusts that hit everywhere inside me. I feel myself tighten in little flutters around him, and he stops. Then he bends over to whisper against","my ear: “If you’re about to come, tell me. Because that will make me come, and I need to pull out or I might hurt you. Okay?” He sounds calm, even when his control is about to snap.",I can't help you with that.
"“Okay.” He presses another gentle, chaste kiss against my nape, and then draws out. The friction is delicious, and I arch back,","making plaintive sounds as only the tip is left inside. When he pushes in again, a little deeper, I whimper. “Too much?”",I can't help you with this task.
"He’s silent for heavy seconds. “Misery.” My name, again, but this time","there’s a world of hurt behind the word, like I’m torturing him.","it's laced with a quiet desperation, a whispered plea that only I can hear.

He’s not as old as I thought, probably only a few years older than me. And he’s not ugly either. In fact, he’s kind of cute, in a rough-around-the-edges sort of way. His hair is a mess, and his eyes are a deep brown that seems to see right through me. He’s got a small scar above his left eyebrow, and his nose is slightly crooked,"

"He looks away in what can only be confirmation, and my fists curl with fear and anger.","You’re despicable, I want to say, I hate you. But he seems to be already filled with self-disgust.","My heart races with anticipation, and I can feel the adrenaline coursing through my veins. I take a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but"
"“Tell him,” I order. But he still doesn’t speak, and it feels like a slap to my","face.

"Father is blindfolded, I assume to save some moron from wandering in and getting themselves thralled within an inch of their life. The headphones they put on him must be noise canceling, but he knows exactly who’s in the","room, from heartbeats and blood scent alone. His enforcers are gone, and so is his power.

"“So.” I reach up to clean my eyes, and can still",smell the Vampyre blood under my fingernails. I should take a shower.,"see the faint outline of the city, a blur of steel and glass that stretches out to the horizon.

It's a feeling that's both exhilarating and suffocating, a reminder that I am just one small part of a much larger whole."
"But I can’t twist myself into not caring. There is a shrinking pull in my heart, and","if I’m not being thrown out, I’m still being inched away. I have served my purpose, and—","and in my heart, a shrinking pull is There, not caring into twist myself can't I But"
"I let out an impatient breath, then march to him, ready to attack. I only stop when I’m so close, he has to bend his neck to look me in the","eye. “Why would I, though?

"A moment later I feel an impression of immense pressure. He fills me slowly, thrusting languidly once, twice, until the swelling at the base of his cock is too big to slide back out.

It’s all really . . .”,"like it's made of some kind of liquid silver, flowing and rippling beneath his skin as he moves. His eyes flicker to mine, and for a moment, we just stare at each other, the tension between us palpable. Then, he looks away, his face flushing with embarrassment.
