"“Anna?” he says, like he’s not entirely sure, and then does a full top-to-bottom sweep of my body, which recalls the lack of pants.","When he digs his hand into his luscious head of hair, I forget to be embarrassed again, because it all comes back to me.","leaves me feeling a little self-conscious, but also a little turned on, which I quickly try to brush off as ridiculous, because",48,"leaves me feeling a little self-conscious, but also a little turned on, which I quickly try to brush off as ridiculous, because we're in the middle of a crisis, and I'm pretty sure he's not checking me out right now, but still, his eyes linger on my bare legs for a moment longer than necessary, and I can feel a flush rising up my neck, which only makes me more aware of the fact that I'm standing here in my underwear, and he's standing there in his, and we're both just staring at each other, unsure of what to do next."
The expression he makes is like the meme of that one kid who smiles and then immediately bursts into tears.,West is staring at me like he’s doomed but must pretend to be happy about it. “Anna.

"“I definitely need to go back to the beginning,” I say, wiping my eyes. I mime an explosion at my temples. “Like—my mind is blown right now. You dressed like a middle schooler around the house. All basketball shorts, all the time. You drove a Honda! West, you’re incognito rich!","No wonder Jake never told me anything about his family! I would have made him pay for Jersey Mike’s every fucking time! Wait. Why did you need to live on campus?

And don't even get me started on the fact that you used to eat Cheetos for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I'm starting to think that you're not as high maintenance as I thought, and that's kind of blowing my mind. I'm not sure if I should be impressed or concerned that you've managed to keep this part of your life a secret for so long. But I have to admit, it's kind of refreshing to see you being so carefree and unapologetic about your past. Maybe I've been judging you too harshly all these years."

“Correct.” He looks down to his lap. “Only Jake knew the real situation. The rest of my family was disappointed that,"I didn’t let them throw me a big wedding, but I guess they weren’t all that surprised.

"He looks me over again, top to bottom, and the defeat in his eyes makes me realize the true extent of my unshowered, feral chaos. “Actually,","Anna,” he says, “I need you to come with me to my sister’s wedding in Indonesia and convincingly play the part of my very loving wife.”","it's not just the state of your clothes and your hair that's the problem, but the desperation in your eyes that's starting to scare me,",52,"it's not just the state of your clothes and your hair that's the problem, but the desperation in your eyes that's starting to scare me, and I'm not sure if I'm ready to deal with whatever it is that's driving you to this point, but I guess I have no choice but to try and help you, even if it means getting a little messy myself, because that's what friends are for, right?"
"It’s surreal to be here with her after all this time. I was so close to being done with this, so near to the finish line, yet here I am, having to improvise an intricate plan B at the eleventh hour with a Muppet in human form as my co-conspirator. Don’t get me wrong, beneath the baked, unshowered disarray, Anna is still a beautiful woman, with enormous brown eyes, creamy skin, and long, willowy limbs. I’d always been fascinated with the perfect beauty mark just above her lip. Unfortunately, right now she looks like","she’s fallen out of a tree and crawled through a field of tangly briers to get back to her apartment. This is probably the closest I’ve ever seen to her natural hair color because the pink has grown out a good inch, leaving a stripe of brown at her roots. Her makeup is, I presume, from yesterday; shadows of mascara carve dark circles beneath her eyes. Despite the old makeup and frazzled appearance, there’s still something striking about her. Her eyes are enormous and bright, framed with dark lashes, her steady gaze entirely without artifice.","a disheveled mess, her usually luscious locks tangled and matted, her eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep, and her skin sallow from the stress of being on the run.

But now, as we huddle in this cramped, dingy alleyway, surrounded by the detritus of a city that never sleeps, I'm struck by the stark contrast between our former lives and our current reality. Anna's eyes lock onto mine, and for a moment, I see a glimmer of the old spark, the one that used to drive us to push the boundaries and take risks. It's a spark that I thought was long extinguished, but now it flickers back to life, and I'm reminded of the countless nights we spent sneaking out of the mansion, laughing and joking as we made our way to our next adventure. I take a deep breath, trying to shake off the nostalgia, and focus on the task at hand. We need to come up with a plan, and fast, before we're caught. I glance around the alleyway, taking in the narrow passageways and the towering skyscrapers that loom above us. It's a maze, and we're just two small fish in a sea of concrete and steel. But I've always been good at navigating the unexpected, and I'm determined to get us out of this mess, no matter what it takes."
"Though I am nearly certain her mind has wandered to something other than the topic at hand, I let her stare at the wall",a little longer so I can stare at her and reconcile this version of Anna with the one I lived with for two years.,"for a few moments, hoping that she will eventually refocus and continue our conversation, but as the silence stretches",48,"for a few moments, hoping that she will eventually refocus and continue our conversation, but as the silence stretches on, I begin to wonder if I should intervene and try to steer her back on track, perhaps with a gentle question or a change of subject, but for now, I remain still, observing her expression, trying to gauge the depth of her distraction."
"As roommates, we didn’t know each other well—that much is probably obvious—but there is an intimacy to sharing a space with someone, a certain kind of kinship that comes with daily proximity. Anna was reasonably tidy and paid her half of the rent when it was due, but she’d never struck me as the organized, driven, premed type. The one time we talked about it, she","said something about medicine being the most palatable of the “real job” options, but she seemed overwhelmed a lot, studying late into the night and painting to decompress in what little free time she had.

But as the weeks went by, I started to notice that she was always on time for our group outings, and her assignments were always turned in on schedule. It was as if she had somehow managed to cultivate a sense of discipline within herself, one that allowed her to balance her carefree nature with a sense of responsibility. I found myself wondering if there was more to Anna than met the eye, and whether her laid-back exterior hid a more complex, multifaceted personality. Our conversations began to delve deeper, and I discovered that she was indeed a creative soul, with a passion for art and music that she expressed through her free time. She'd often spend hours sketching in her notebook, and her room was filled with half-finished canvases and scattered paint tubes. It was a side of her that I hadn't seen before, and I found myself drawn to it, feeling a sense of admiration for the way she balanced her artistic expression with the demands of our shared living space. As our friendship grew, I began to realize that Anna was more than just a roommate – she was a kindred spirit, someone who understood the importance of living in the moment, while still striving for a sense of purpose and direction. And I found myself grateful for the unexpected bond we'd formed, one that had brought a sense of joy and creativity into my life that I hadn't known was missing."

"“Yes.” I work to not let my gaze do another sweep of her apartment. I’ve never been to Pulau Jingga, but my mom has been sending me info that I’ve mostly ignored for months. I know the basic idea—a luxury resort and conservation area set in the Indonesian archipelago—and it’s about","as far from this dark, cramped living room as I can imagine.

I've been trying to avoid thinking about it, but my mom's messages keep popping up on my phone, reminding me that I need to make a decision soon. The resort's marketing materials look beautiful, with crystal-clear waters and lush green forests, but I know it's all just a facade. I've seen the real Indonesia, the one that's raw and untamed, and I'm not sure I'm ready to face the contrast.

“I have the one of you and Jake hiking the Hills in a frame in my living room.

The truth behind everything isn’t important right now, and if this goes the way I hope it","will, this will be an easy twelve days together and then we’ll never have to see each other again. “Anna, are you available to do this?

"Once, when we were roommates, Anna flew to Seattle with a friend. It had been her first time on an airplane, and she struggled so much navigating the travel website that she brought me her laptop at midnight and asked for help. I finished the transaction for her, prebooked the car","to the airport, and then quietly tracked the ride the day she left to make sure she got there okay. When she got home, she made a point of thanking me for the help. Apparently, the trip itself was fine, but the highlight for her had been flying on an airplane.","rental, and even helped her download the necessary travel documents on her phone, but what struck me most was her wide-eyed wonder as she gazed out the airplane window at the clouds below, her voice filled with a mix of excitement and trepidation as she asked me",102,"rental, and even helped her download the necessary travel documents on her phone, but what struck me most was her wide-eyed wonder as she gazed out the airplane window at the clouds below, her voice filled with a mix of excitement and trepidation as she asked me if I thought the plane would really take off into the sky. I smiled and reassured her that it was completely normal, but little did I know that this was just the beginning of her journey, one that would take her to places I could hardly imagine, and change her life in ways I was yet to understand. As I watched her drift off to sleep, her laptop still open on my lap, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and responsibility, knowing that I had played a small part in making this adventure possible, and that our friendship was about to be tested in ways I had never experienced before. The flight attendants came by to offer us snacks and drinks, and I took the opportunity to grab a few hours of sleep myself, but my mind kept wandering back to Anna, and the incredible journey that lay ahead of her, and the role I had unwittingly taken on as her guide and confidant. When I woke up a few hours later, the plane was descending, and Anna was sitting up, her eyes fixed on the window once again, this time with a look of awe and wonder that I had never seen before. ""We're landing,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the roar of the engines, and I smiled, feeling a sense of excitement and trepidation myself, knowing that our adventure was finally coming to an end, but also knowing that it was only the beginning of a new chapter in our lives, one that would be filled with laughter, tears, and memories that would last a lifetime. As the plane touched down on the runway, Anna turned to me with a huge grin on her face, and I knew in that moment that our friendship had been forever changed, and that nothing would ever be the same again."

The cabinets are made of reclaimed wood, and the countertops are a beautiful butcher block. A small table and chairs sit in one corner, perfect for a quiet breakfast or a casual dinner. I feel a sense of peace wash over me as I take in the space, and I realize that this little bungalow is exactly what I needed – a place to call my own, where I can escape the chaos of the world and simply be. As I explore further, I notice a small door that I hadn't seen before, which appears to lead to a narrow hallway. I push the door open, and a faint scent of jasmine wafts out, drawing me in. The hallway is dimly lit, with a soft glow emanating from a string of fairy lights that hang from the ceiling. I follow the hallway to a small room at the end, which appears to be some sort of home office or study. The room is cluttered with books and papers, and a large wooden desk sits in the center of the room, surrounded by a comfortable-looking armchair and a small reading nook. I feel a sense of excitement and curiosity as I take in the space, wondering what secrets it might hold. As I begin to explore the room further, I notice a small, leather-bound book lying open on the desk. The pages are yellowed with age, and the text is written in a language I don't recognize. I pick up the book, feeling a strange sense of connection to it, as if it holds some sort of significance that I'm not yet aware of. I turn the pages, studying the text, and suddenly, a phrase catches my eye – a phrase that sends a shiver down my spine, and makes me wonder if I'm ready for what I might discover."
