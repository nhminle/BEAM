We went to the",41,"up together, sharing countless memories and creating a bond that only time and distance could strengthen. We went to the same schools, played on the same sports teams, and even had our first heartbreaks around the same time, which somehow made our friendship even more unbreakable. Chad was always there for me, offering a listening ear and a comforting presence whenever I needed it, and I tried to return the favor whenever he faced his own struggles. As we grew older, our friendship evolved, but the foundation of trust and loyalty remained the same, a testament to the power of a lifelong friendship that began in the earliest days of our lives."
"Anyway, forward to five months ago. I dated Hope [28f] for a few weeks. Not a big deal. We decided we weren’t feeling it, no chemistry, so we called it quits. And then lo and behold she hits","it off with Chad. Of course in true Good Luck Charm fashion, this means Chad is her soulmate. Chad is all googly-eyed over her, they’ve met the parents, they’re ring shopping—and they want to move in together. Immediately.","and I was surprised, but not entirely shocked, as I had a feeling our breakup was going to be a bit more complicated than I initially thought.

It turned out Hope had already started talking to my best friend, Alex, and things had progressed quickly between them. I tried to brush it off, thinking it was just a harmless friendship, but deep down, I knew better. A few weeks later, I ran into them at a coffee shop, and the awkwardness was palpable. They seemed happy, but I could sense a hint of guilt in their body language. I decided to keep my cool and be the bigger person, but it was hard not to feel a pang of jealousy. Little did I know, this was only the beginning of a long and complicated journey of unrequited love, friendship, and ultimately, a difficult decision that would test the true meaning of friendship and love."
"The only problem is that Chad has six more months on our lease but found a perfect new house for him and Hope, and he can’t afford to pay rent on two places at the same",time. So he had to make the difficult decision to screw me over or screw her over—and he picked me.

"I’m annoyed, but I decided to try to find a reason to spend more time outside so I don’t have to stare out my window. I’ve always wanted a dog, but Chad would never agree to it. So I went to a rescue and found the ugliest animal there. The one so hideous, nobody else wanted it. This dog’s got an underbite and mange, and he’s missing half an","ear. He’s a little Brussels Griffon, so he’s got that deep frown—he looks like a judgmental gremlin. I adopted him and named him Chad since the dog is now my new best friend. If you’re reading this, you’re dead to me, human Chad. (Not really, I still love the guy.) But I tag him in the captions of every Chad the Dog Instagram post with “Look, a loyal Chad!”","ear, but there was something about him that made me feel a connection.

Maybe it was the way he wagged his tail when I approached, or the way he looked up at me with those big brown eyes. Whatever it was, I knew I had to take him home. I named him Ugly and brought him back to my apartment, where Chad was less than thrilled to meet our new addition. ""What is this?"" he asked, eyeing Ugly's mangy coat and underbite. I just shrugged and said, ""He's a rescue."" Chad sighed and shook his head, but I could tell he was secretly charmed by Ugly's goofy demeanor. As the days went by, Ugly quickly became a part of the family, and Chad even started to spoil him rotten. But I knew that Ugly's past was marked by neglect and abandonment, and I was determined to give him the love and care he deserved. I started taking him on long walks around the block, and he would pull on his leash, his tail wagging excitedly as he sniffed all the interesting smells. People would stop and pet him, cooing over his ugliness, and I would smile and say, ""Yes, he's a real sweetheart."" And as I looked at Ugly, I realized that sometimes, it's the imperfections that make us the most beautiful. I was glad I had taken a chance on him, and I knew that he would be by my side for a long time to come."
I tilted my head so my braid fell to one side and held up four fingers. Maddy,"didn’t look happy, but she took the picture with my phone, then handed it back to me.","was about to count them, but I interrupted her, asking if she had seen the new mural on",34,"was about to count them, but I interrupted her, asking if she had seen the new mural on the wall near the old oak tree."
"“That dog trusts him,” Maddy said. “And that’s a rescue dog, so that means something.

That night after work Maddy made dinner. Grilled portobello mushrooms and rice pilaf. I did,"the dishes and cleaned the kitchen, then took a shower and blew out my hair.","not know what to expect, but the aroma wafting from the kitchen was tantalizing,",30,"not know what to expect, but the aroma wafting from the kitchen was tantalizing, and my stomach growled in anticipation as I took a seat at the table, watching Maddy expertly juggle multiple pans and utensils with a practiced ease that I had grown accustomed to over the years of our relationship."

My best friend was in a Hawaiian shirt and pink cargo shorts. He was a general manager at Trader Joe’s. I missed not having to go to the grocery store now,"that he had moved out.

They were starting to do the couples thing for all the trips and birthdays. They were all going up,"to Lutsen in October to go hiking. They asked me if I wanted to go, but I didn’t.

“But what if it isn’t? I’m just playing devil’s advocate here. What if it isn’t? Brad said that everyone I’m serious enough to date more than twice is cosmically destined for someone else.” He went quiet for,"a beat. “Does nobody feel right to you?

The thought sent a pang of uncertainty through me, and I found myself wondering if I was just settling for the wrong people, or if I was truly meant to be with someone else.

I mean, the possibilities are endless, and I'm not just talking about the scientific implications – think about the potential applications, the funding, the recognition. This could be the opportunity of a lifetime, and I'm not willing to let it slip through our fingers without at least exploring it further."

Need a ride?”","smile on his face, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions - excitement for the freedom that summer brought, but also a hint",46,"smile on his face, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions - excitement for the freedom that summer brought, but also a hint of sadness that our carefree days were coming to an end, and as we exchanged our usual summer school goodbye, I noticed something peculiar in his eyes, a glint that seemed almost like a secret, and I found myself wondering what it could be, and whether it was connected to the mysterious letter he had received a few days ago, the one with the strange return address and the cryptic message that had left him looking troubled and preoccupied, and as we walked out of the school building together, the warm sun on our faces, I couldn't shake off the feeling that this summer was going to be different, that something was about to change, and I wasn't sure if I was ready for it."

Maddy looked up. Then her eyes dropped to the laptop I was holding and she somehow immediately,"knew what was about to happen. “No.” She shook her head. “No. No, no, no, no, no. NO.”","seemed to understand the significance of the open browser window, her gaze lingering on",35,"seemed to understand the significance of the open browser window, her gaze lingering on the search history and the highlighted words that read ""your name"" and ""missing person"" in bold."

Maddy must have been thinking the same thing I was. “Does it rain a,"lot in Minnesota?” she asked, raising her voice over the sound of the old motor.","lot in this city, or is it just the storm that's brewing in my mind, because every",29,"lot in this city, or is it just the storm that's brewing in my mind, because every time I look out the window, the sky seems to be a deep, foreboding grey, like a reflection of my mood, and I wonder if the rain will ever wash away the memories that haunt me."
We lugged our bags up the stairs and were sweating by the time we made it to the door. We came in through a screened-in porch that overlooked the lake. Maddy and,I shared a glance. It was adorable. White wicker rocking chairs and a small matching loveseat with thick floral cushions. A cute coffee table and plastic ferns in wrought-iron planters and hanging baskets.,"was already sitting on the couch, her eyes fixed on the water as if lost in thought.

The air inside was thick with the scent of old books and stale air, a smell that seemed to cling to every surface like a damp shroud. We dropped our bags on the floor and made our way over to the kitchen, where a note on the counter read ""Welcome, help yourself to anything you need."" The fridge was stocked with an assortment of leftovers and takeout containers, a testament to the fact that Maddy had been here for a while. We rummaged through the cupboards, searching for something to drink, and found a half-empty bottle of wine and a six-pack of beer. As we poured ourselves a glass, the sound of the lake lapping against the shore outside created a soothing melody that seemed to wash away the fatigue of our journey. But as we sat down at the kitchen table, Maddy's expression remained distant, her eyes still fixed on the water as if something was weighing heavily on her mind."
"The bedrooms were off the living room on either side of a short hallway with a single bathroom shared in the middle. The bathroom had a white claw-foot tub, pale blue","tile, and an old pedestal sink. I took the room with the cushioned reading nook in the window and Maddy picked the one with the hanging swing chair in the corner.","and a matching sink, its porcelain gleaming in the soft light that filtered through the frosted glass window above.

The floors were made of dark hardwood, polished to a high shine, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of old books and the faint hint of lavender, a fragrance that seemed to linger from the previous owner's love of gardening."
"Four hours later, Maddy and I were back at the cottage sitting in the screened-in porch.",We’d had dinner in town and then boated back. The fridge was stocked up and we’d unpacked.,"surrounded by the soothing sounds of nature, sipping sweet tea and trying to process the events",33,"surrounded by the soothing sounds of nature, sipping sweet tea and trying to process the events that had transpired, the warm sunlight casting a golden glow over the tranquil scene, as we both struggled to come to terms with the revelation that had shaken us to our core."
She looked away from me. “Emma…” Her eyes came back to mine. “Please. Please do it.,Do it now before you lose the chance to meet them altogether.

"“How about this,” Maddy said. “Run your DNA and make your account private. We’ll change your privacy settings for a few minutes, poke around.

We prioritized power for the coffee maker first and we brewed a pot while I sat in the kitchen with,"a towel wrapped around my head. When it was done, Maddy poured me a cup and handed it to me.","my eyes fixed on the clock, watching the seconds tick by as the aroma of freshly ground coffee",40,"my eyes fixed on the clock, watching the seconds tick by as the aroma of freshly ground coffee filled the air, and the sound of the brewer's gurgling water and hissing steam created a soothing background melody that seemed to calm my nerves, but my mind was still racing with thoughts of the meeting that was about to take place, and the weight of responsibility that rested on my shoulders, as I tried to mentally prepare myself for the challenges that lay ahead, and the uncertainty of the outcome, and the what-ifs that swirled in my head like a maelstrom, making it difficult to focus on the simple task at hand, but the warmth of the coffee that was now ready, and the promise of a much-needed caffeine boost, helped to clear my head, and I took a deep breath, and tried to push aside my doubts and fears, and focus on the present moment, and the task that needed to be accomplished."
The snail’s-pace speed the pontoon put out somehow seemed faster with the beach approaching. Maddy threw it in reverse. The engine,"downshifted miserably, but we started to slow. Then to my horror we began to move backward, motor first, right into the dock.","roared to life, but the pontoon's momentum carried it forward, and it scraped against the hull of a nearby boat, causing a loud",43,"roared to life, but the pontoon's momentum carried it forward, and it scraped against the hull of a nearby boat, causing a loud screech that echoed across the marina.

"When we were safely away from anything we could crash into, Maddy killed the engine and slumped in the captain’s","seat. “If we’d been on the other side of the dock, we could have hit the yacht,” she said, looking shaken.","chair, letting out a sigh of relief as the silence that followed was a welcome respite from the chaos of the",41,"chair, letting out a sigh of relief as the silence that followed was a welcome respite from the chaos of the past few hours, the dim glow of the dashboard lights casting an eerie ambiance in the small cockpit, the only sound being the soft hum of the engine's cooling system and the distant lapping of the waves against the hull of the boat."
"I lined the nose of the boat up with the side of the dock and started for it again, only this time I killed the thrust earlier.

"Her phone rang. “Oh, hold on. I have to leave my ringer on in case Maddy gets in trouble trying to get back.” She looked at it. “It’s her.” She swiped and put the",phone to her ear. “Maddy?

I hadn’t really cared too much that Benny might not be here today. He wasn’t the point of this visit. But all that,had changed in the last ten minutes.

“I hope so. It’s been a little stressful.” She picked up Murder Mittens. “I don’t think I really thought this island thing through. It,"sounded like a good idea at the time but it’s kind of inconvenient.

Maddy was already off the pontoon and running toward me across the beach.

"Amber was in a flowing white-and-peach chiffon summer dress with a slit up the thigh. Her long brown hair was down, she had on a floppy wide-brimmed hat and huge sunglasses.

"“Emma, you won’t believe my day,” she said, looking back at me. “So I wanted to surprise you. I flew all the way over here on","a red-eye, got an Uber, and came out to the address you gave me, but when I knocked on the door this handsome man answered instead.”","my own, and I have to say, it was quite the adventure.

I watched him walk to the beach and I let out a long breath. Maddy was right.,"This was bad. Mom never left anywhere on good terms. Not jobs, or apartments, or relationships.

I felt relieved the instant he said he would stay with me because it let Maddy off the hook. She would walk through hell for,me—and this cookout was her hell. I was glad she didn’t have to be here.

"“He’ll probably completely forget we even exist,” she mumbled, resting her head on","the cushion. “Amber has a way of making people do that,” she said tiredly.","the worn wooden railing of the old porch, her eyes drifting out to the empty",27,"the worn wooden railing of the old porch, her eyes drifting out to the empty street beyond, where the flickering streetlights cast long shadows that seemed to stretch and twist in the fading light of day."

"When I got back to the cottage an hour later, Maddy was in the screened-in porch, reading. She","wore shorts and flip-flops, and she was drinking a beer.

It was never going to happen. I knew this. But Maddy wouldn’t let it go unless,"I tried—and really, I should try.

"I paused, not sure how much I wanted to share. I decided on all of it. Emma was going to","be here when it all hit the fan anyway, so there was no point in keeping her in the dark.","hear the whole story, every detail, every emotion, every thought that had been swirling in",40,"hear the whole story, every detail, every emotion, every thought that had been swirling in my mind since that fateful night, and I took a deep breath, preparing myself for the inevitable questions and reactions that would follow, wondering if she would still be my friend after hearing the truth about my past."

I might kiss her tonight. I almost did the other night at the,"dock, but then Amber showed up. I was looking forward to the do-over.","was a dinner party, but I restrained myself, not wanting to ruin the evening",26,"was a dinner party, but I restrained myself, not wanting to ruin the evening for her, or for myself, as I wasn't sure how she felt, and I didn't want to risk losing the chance to get to know her better, to see if there was a real connection between us, to find out if the spark I felt was mutual, and to avoid any potential awkwardness that could arise from an unrequited kiss."
I’d tried to be softer with her the last few days. The energy shift I’d had over Mom after my talk with Emma,"was almost as bad as being mad at her.

"This was another thing I was trying not to think about—her leaving. I should be happy that she came at all, that she wasn’t in Hawaii. We still had three more dates, maybe more if I could convince her. I’d already gotten a freebie the other night at","Mom’s. But I dreaded the clock running out.

"What did I have to offer her? I had nothing but baggage. Emotionally damaged, traumatized children that had been catapulted from one tragedy to the next, and me, barely keeping my head above water.
