"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking. Lacerations too, from a Taser—he’d shot at two of the team members who’d come to expatriate him, and a third was forced to fire.","their bodies had been repatriated to the early 19th century, where they would be buried with full military honors, a gesture that was both a testament to their service and a poignant reminder of the risks they had taken to be here.

The remaining five expats, including Graham, were still struggling to adjust to their new surroundings, and the constant barrage of unfamiliar sights and sounds was taking its toll on their mental health. The hospital staff had been doing their best to help them cope, but it was clear that the process of readjustment would be a long and arduous one. Graham's own memories of his life in the 19th century were hazy and fragmented, and he found himself wondering if he would ever be able to fully reconcile his past and present selves. As he lay in his hospital bed, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was living in a dream, and that at any moment he would wake up to find himself back in his own time, surrounded by the familiar comforts of his own era."
"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into","his eighties. As it was, he was thirty-seven years old and had not experienced crinolines, A Tale of Two Cities, or the enfranchisement of the working classes.","the 1880s, when the industrial revolution was in full swing, and the area was rapidly expanding to accommodate the influx of new residents.

"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale.

"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer. I’m sure he knew plenty about ship’s rigging, but he’d probably never handled an instrument more technologically complex than a sextant.

However, Gore's fascination with the intricate mechanisms of the clockwork device was palpable, and he found himself pouring over diagrams and blueprints, determined to understand the underlying principles that governed its operation. As he delved deeper into the world of gears and levers, he began to see the beauty in the machine's complexity, and his initial skepticism gave way to a sense of wonder and awe. The more he learned, the more he realized that the clockwork device was not just a tool, but a window into a world of precision and order, a world that was both familiar and yet utterly alien to his nautical background. His colleagues, who had grown accustomed to his expertise in navigation and ship handling, looked on in amazement as Gore's interests shifted from the open sea to the inner workings of the clockwork device, and they couldn't help but wonder what had sparked this sudden change in him."
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people. Hunting was out of the question, and socializing was limited by order of the Ministry. By the end of the first week he was visibly going bonkers with no one but me to talk to.","reading, and his love for literature was evident in the way he spoke about the works of Dickens and Austen, often quoting passages from memory with a wit that left me in awe.

His passion for music was contagious, and I found myself attending concerts and recitals more frequently, not just to support him, but to experience the joy he derived from it. His love for nature was another aspect that drew me in, as he would often take me on long walks through the woods, pointing out the intricate details of the flora and fauna that I had previously overlooked. Despite his many talents and interests, Gore was never one to boast or seek attention, and it was this humility that made him all the more endearing to me."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea. He told me stories as if he were trying to catch himself in amber. Just like my mother, though I didn’t tell him that.","the comings and goings of sailors, the smell of saltwater and tar, the cries of gulls overhead, and the endless horizon stretching out before him.

He must have been a man of the sea, a sailor or a merchant, someone who had spent his life navigating the unpredictable tides of the ocean. And yet, here he was, in this strange new world, where the ships were steel and iron, and the people were a blur of faces rushing to and fro. He must have felt like a relic from another age, a man out of time, struggling to make sense of the world around him. His eyes would scan the crowds, taking in the towering skyscrapers, the neon lights, the cacophony of sounds and smells that assaulted his senses. He would see people staring at small, glowing rectangles in their hands, their faces bathed in the pale light of screens, and he would wonder what sorcery it was that had brought about such a transformation. And yet, despite the strangeness of it all, he would also see the same fundamental human nature that had driven him to set sail across the seas, to explore the unknown, to seek out new horizons. He would see the same hopes and fears, the same dreams and desires, the same capacity for kindness and cruelty that had defined his own era. And in that, he would find a sense of comfort, a sense of belonging, a sense that he was not so far removed from the world he knew after all."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake. Another person’s unguardedness in that moment can be very useful, interpersonally, as long as you don’t soften. There is language I could use about this if I were the melodramatic type: behind enemy lines, for example, or double agent. My sister might use these terms, or she might call me a fraud.","it turned out, he was not as surprised as I had anticipated, I couldn't help but wonder if he had suspected all along.

I, on the other hand, felt a mix of emotions: guilt for deceiving him, relief that the truth was finally out, and a hint of anxiety about how he would react. The air was thick with tension as we stood there, the only sound the soft hum of the refrigerator in the background. I broke the silence, my voice barely above a whisper, ""I'm sorry, Gore. I didn't mean to deceive you."" His response was immediate, but his words were laced with a hint of disappointment, ""Why did you feel the need to hide the truth from me?"" I took a deep breath, preparing myself for the conversation that was about to unfold."

The ice outside shifts—the Arctic stammering its jaws as a cat does when it sees a bird. The ship’s cat died in convulsions during,"their second winter. Gore had liked that cat.

"Once we arrived at the Ministry, an escort of subtly armed suits took Gore to meet the other expats.

"“Complex,” said Adela. “Thanks for your input. Given their histories, mental trauma is to be anticipated.

"We went for lunch at a small bistro near the Ministry. Gore came from an era of service à la française, private dining rooms and putting everything into jelly.

The intricately set table, the crisp white linens, and the impeccable service all transported me to a bygone era, one that seemed to be a world away from the fast-paced, modern world I was accustomed to. As I perused the menu, I noticed that the dishes were all named after famous French artists, and I couldn't help but wonder if the chef had a secret passion for art or if it was simply a clever marketing ploy. The waiter, noticing my curiosity, leaned in and whispered that the chef was indeed an art lover, and that each dish was inspired by a specific piece or artist. I was intrigued and decided to order the ""Mona Lisa"" salad, not just for the name, but for the promise of a culinary masterpiece."
"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to",take us to”—here he raised his eyebrows—“a public house.

"Graham used other words too, not wrong, exactly, but not right, like “your people,” or “your culture.” When I said, in a wincingly tight voice, that we had the same people and culture, he replied, mildly, “But I don’t think that we do.” Then came the image searches about Cambodia, on food and dress","and customs.

"By the start of that summer, Graham was practically a native of the era. He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle. Most mornings he rose—hours before me—and",went for a run. He would sometimes wake me up with a juicy smoker’s wheeze on his return to the house.

"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past. I was prickly and defensive about","this; I could not look at why directly. I heard the way I spoke to him about it: adjustment, reasonable, citizen, responsibility, values. He blew a lot of pensive cigarette smoke at me.","my own heritage, but Graham's disdain for the modern world was a different kind of prickliness, one that stemmed from a deep-seated sense of loss and disconnection from the world he once",65,"my own heritage, but Graham's disdain for the modern world was a different kind of prickliness, one that stemmed from a deep-seated sense of loss and disconnection from the world he once knew. He would often speak wistfully of the past, of the music and the movies, the books and the people, that had shaped him into the man he was today, and I couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for him, for the sense of disorientation that must come with being a relic of a bygone era. As I listened to his stories, I began to see the world through his eyes, to understand the ways in which the past and present collided in his mind, and to appreciate the complexity of his character, which was at once nostalgic and forward-thinking, traditional and rebellious."
"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them. Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled","to focus on the tests—eyes moving rapidly. I once found him the sole occupant of the fifth-floor smoking area (a pigeon-shit-encrusted balcony), methodically shredding a filter of a finished cigarette. I watched him for a while, interested in the way that only his fingers moved. Most people ripple with surplus motion unless they are concentrating, but Graham only ever moved the parts of him that he wanted to move.","to maintain a steady gaze, while Rachel's eyes darted around the room, her pupils constricting involuntarily as she recalled the sterile smell of the hospital where her mother had passed away.

The researchers, however, were not deterred by these reactions and decided to conduct the tests in a more neutral environment, a large, dimly lit room with a single, unadorned table and two chairs in the center. The expats were seated in the chairs, and the researchers stood behind them, their faces expressionless, as they presented the stimuli, a series of images and videos designed to elicit a range of emotions. The first image was of a child crying, its face red and contorted in anguish, and the expats' reactions were immediate and intense, with some covering their mouths in horror and others looking away in distress. The researchers took note of their responses, but it was clear that the expats were not responding as they had hoped, and they began to wonder if their methods were flawed or if the expats were simply too desensitized to the suffering of others. As the tests continued, the researchers started to notice a peculiar trend - the expats were not reacting to the images of human suffering, but they were responding strongly to images of environmental degradation and destruction, such as a polluted river or a clear-cut forest. This was not what the researchers had expected, and they began to question the nature of the expats' empathy and what it meant to be a ""normal"" human being."
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too. Even Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had","fought in large-scale battles, were laid out by the ultramodern scope of the harm.

The debate raged on, with some arguing that the ends justified the means, while others insisted that the well-being of the participants should be the top priority. As the days went by, the team struggled to find a balance between scientific progress and human compassion."
"Adela was always present at the honesty exams, often intervening in them.

"I went along to one of the earliest dinners, chicken bag slung over my shoulder. Bridges tended not to eat at the Ministry canteen with administrative staff and the operators on the Wellness team—the office-based employees—and the decorous hostility with which the paper pushers met me was adorable. When I got to the","kitchen itself, the first thing I saw was Graham leaning down to light a cigarette on the gas ring, his curls dangerously close to the hob.

Rachel looked up as I sat down, her expression a mix of curiosity and wariness, and I could tell she was sizing me up, trying to decide whether to engage in conversation or not. I broke the silence by asking her how her day was going, and she launched into a detailed account of the latest drama on the floor, from the ongoing feud between two of the senior operators to the latest rumors about a possible restructuring of the department. As she spoke, I found myself getting drawn into her world, and before I knew it, we'd been talking for over an hour, lost in a conversation that flowed easily and effortlessly, like we'd known each other for years."
"She put a glass down in front of me—ice, water, an oily suggestion of cordial, and,","sure enough, some fussy edible garnishes. I blinked at it and then at Margaret, who smiled.","a small, delicate slice of lemon, which she had carefully arranged to float upon the surface,",32,"and a small, delicate slice of lemon, which she had carefully arranged to float upon the surface, as if to tempt my thirst and revive my spirits."

"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it,","was a mystery.

"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had","just discovered that a woman with whom he was spending a lot of time would never be interested in him.

"Graham blew smoke out through his nose reflectively. “I see,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s fair to call him ‘grim,’ though you wouldn’t be the","first to say it. He was a severe disciplinarian, it’s true. Held grudges. But he was a very lonely person.

"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders. The bridges kept turning in their core reports, and the experiments kept running.

I felt a shiver run down my spine as I followed her to the lab, my mind racing with possibilities. What could be going on? Was it something we'd missed, or something more sinister? I pushed open the door to the lab, and was hit with a wave of confusion. The equipment was all still there, but it was different. The screens were flashing with strange symbols, and the machines were beeping in a pattern I'd never seen before. ""What's going on?"" I asked Adela, my voice barely above a whisper. She shook her head, her eyes scanning the room. ""I don't know,"" she said. ""But I think we're in trouble."" I took a step forward, my heart pounding in my chest. And that's when I saw it. A small, unassuming device on the counter, with a screen that read ""Temporal Displacement Event Imminent"". My mind reeled as I stared at the words, my thoughts racing with the implications. What did it mean? And what was going to happen next?"
"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events. He’d lain motionless in the garden for two hours, on","a wet and putrid night, to shoot a fox, and pulled out one of his own rotting teeth (he showed it to me afterward; it was the color of a tombstone, caped with gelatinous red)—was this Victorian, or was this “irregularities”?","his back, staring blankly at the sky, his eyes fixed on some point beyond the treetops, his face a mask of serenity that only served to heighten the sense of unease that had been growing within me since his sudden departure from",81,"his back, staring blankly at the sky, his eyes fixed on some point beyond the treetops, his face a mask of serenity that only served to heighten the sense of unease that had been growing within me since his sudden departure from the dinner table.

"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century.

Nevertheless, he had taken to cooking in a way he had failed to take to","television or texting or the use of deodorants (“I bathe every day,” he’d said to me with hurt dignity). Tonight, he hummed with a busyness that hardly shielded nervousness. He burned the onions and automatically reached for his cigarettes.

He remembered the way the sizzle of the bacon had filled the air, the sound of the pots clanging against the metal countertops, and the smell of the sea mixed with the savory aromas of the food. It was a world away from the sterile, high-tech kitchen he now found himself in, but the sense of comfort and security it brought him was the same. He felt a sense of pride in being able to provide for himself, to take care of his own needs, and to create something nourishing and delicious from scratch. As he plated his breakfast, he couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment, a sense of belonging in this strange new world."
Margaret was wearing high-waisted cerulean bell-bottoms and a white blouse clocked with lace.

"Arthur was happy and flushed. He was one of those unusual extroverts who have all the attributes of an introvert, save that they like being around other people. He had a gift for gentleness too, one of the rarest virtues in","any gender and especially in the kind of man Arthur was supposed to be.

In her own era, she’d slept in the room next to the one where she had been born.","She thought Scotland was far-flung and semi-barbaric.

The men spoke of power and ambition, of success and failure, of the cutthroat world of business and politics, and Margaret found herself drawn to the words, her mind racing with the possibilities of a life beyond the narrow confines of her own."
"How the topic of weed came up I couldn’t remember—probably during one of the vigorous debates about what the twenty-first century had genuinely improved, which in",the opinion of the expats was a mixed bag.

"Meeting Margaret made me vivid and receptive. Sentences weighed more. I kept a half-conscious catalog of where the men were looking. I’ve seen people deal with this in different ways.

"“Such matters are between myself and God,” he said gravely. “Oh, stop frowning, Sixty-five.","Arthur, will you please lead her in a polka, if you can still stand.”","your face is as stern as the stone walls of this ancient monastery, but",28,"your face is as stern as the stone walls of this ancient monastery, but I sense a glimmer of unease behind those piercing eyes, a flicker of doubt that threatens to undermine the resolve you've so carefully crafted, a whispered promise of secrets yet to be revealed, and I am determined to uncover them, no matter the cost, for I have a feeling that the truth you're hiding is far more complex, far more sinister, than you're letting on, and I will not rest until I've unraveled the tangled threads of your conscience, until I've exposed the darkness that lurks beneath the surface of your tranquil demeanor, until I've forced you to confront the shadows that haunt your every waking moment, and perhaps, just perhaps, we can find a way to heal the wounds of the past, to mend the tears in the fabric of your soul, and to bring a measure of peace to this troubled heart of yours."
"“In this age, musicians are imprinted inside music boxes, and there is no need for the band to","keep time,” said Margaret. “You will instruct me in the polka, or I will step on your toes.”","perform live, as the technology has advanced to the point where a single musician can create",36,"perform live, as the technology has advanced to the point where a single musician can create an entire orchestra's worth of sound, but some argue that this has led to a loss of authenticity and emotional connection between the artist and the audience, as the intimacy and raw energy of a live performance are irreplaceable, and many fans still crave the experience of witnessing a band play together in the same room, with the same heartbeat and the same sweat, and the same sense of community that comes with it, and some even claim that the music box revolution has created a new kind of isolation, where people are more connected to their devices than to each other, and the music has become a mere background noise, a distraction from the world around us, rather than a powerful force that brings us together, and inspires us to be our best selves."
"Arthur, by contrast, danced beautifully. He dipped me, and I bent like","a reed. He spun me, and I was, with such satisfaction, spun.","felt the music swirling around me, the lights blurring into a",24,"felt the music swirling around me, the lights blurring into a kaleidoscope of colors as we twirled across the floor, our movements perfectly in sync, the crowd cheering and clapping in time with the rhythm, Arthur's eyes locked onto mine with a radiant smile, and for a moment, I felt like I was floating on air, free from all worries and cares, lost in the magic of the dance."
"As soon as she stepped in, I started making a tally of the evidence of unbeauty. There was a chair whose seat was filled with clothes too dirty for the wardrobe but too clean for the washing basket. My bedside table sprouted two water glasses and a mug. Dust crouched on the skirting boards and in the seams of","my chest of drawers.

The kitchen was no better, with crumbs scattered across the countertops and a sink full of dirty dishes. It was clear that the occupant had been neglecting their household chores for some time, and I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets this place might hold. As I continued to survey the space, I noticed a stack of unpaid bills on the kitchen table, and a calendar that seemed to be several months out of date. It was a mess, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as I wondered what kind of person lived in such a state of disarray."
Margaret appeared unaware of any of these concerns. She didn’t even glance at herself,in the mirror.

"The door grumbled shut and I fell back into a doze. Margaret was snoring lightly, like a puppy being squeezed. The door reopened, and I","surfaced to vague consciousness.

"All the expats had phones, paid for (and tapped) by the Ministry. Graham had switched his own phone on a total of three times in the seven","months he had been in the twenty-first century. I was therefore unsurprised when, about half an hour after their plane landed, I got a call from Arthur’s phone.","years he had been living in the country, and each time it was only to receive a call from his sister, who was still in the States, checking in on him and making",55,"years he had been living in the country, and each time it was only to receive a call from his sister, who was still in the States, checking in on him and making sure he was still alive. The Ministry's control over their communication was absolute, and Graham had grown accustomed to the feeling of being watched, even when he was alone in his small apartment. He had tried to resist, to find ways to circumvent the Ministry's surveillance, but it seemed that no matter what he did, they always managed to stay one step ahead. The isolation was starting to take its toll on him, and Graham couldn't help but wonder if it was all worth it, if the benefits of living in this supposedly ""utopian"" society were worth the cost of his freedom."
"Arthur was striding up the street, bent slightly against a wind which didn’t exist. He was wearing a tweed jacket and looked like a period piece,","but then again, so did Pimlico.

The people passing by on the sidewalk barely gave him a second glance, too caught up in their own lives to notice the anachronism that was Arthur, a man out of time, lost in a world that was rapidly leaving him behind."
"It paid off in the early autumn. When I came down for breakfast one morning, I found","Graham at the counter with a dictionary and a tin of protein powder, performing exegesis on the label.","that the garden was already transformed, with the once-barren trees now donning a vibrant cloak of golden",35,"that the garden was already transformed, with the once-barren trees now donning a vibrant cloak of golden hues, and the air filled with the sweet fragrance of ripening fruits, a stark contrast to the desolate landscape I had left behind just a few short months prior."
"Adela was of the “never been to the GP in my life because I’m not a pussy” school of care, and nothing changed. If the expats were","dangerously ill, they’d be removed to the wards and never mind the trigger; if they could get a grip and deal with it at home, they should.","that is, the ones who had been living in the country for years, had a different attitude towards healthcare, they would often visit their doctors",54,"that is, the ones who had been living in the country for years, had a different attitude towards healthcare, they would often visit their doctors regularly, not just for check-ups but also for preventive measures, and Adela's stubbornness was starting to raise some eyebrows among her expat friends, who couldn't understand why she wouldn't take care of her health, especially when she was getting older, and her body was starting to show signs of wear and tear, but Adela was adamant that she knew her body better than any doctor, and that she could handle any health issue that came her way, and so she continued to ignore the advice of her friends and family, and instead relied on her own instincts, which, as it turned out, were not always reliable."
"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs. Given the prevalence of prostitution in Victorian England, the nonexistence of reliable barrier contraception in his era, and the fact that he was a sailor, this suggested he was either a virgin or very lucky.

Many of them, it appeared, found the more liberated attitudes of the twenty-first century to be jarring and even repulsive. Some had even been known to request transfers to earlier eras, where they could more easily maintain their traditional values. I couldn't help but wonder if Graham's aversion to sex was a result of his own personal experiences, or if it was simply a product of his rigid upbringing. As I pondered this, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to Graham's story than he was letting on, and I found myself increasingly curious about his past. I decided to do some digging, to see if I could uncover any clues that might shed some light on his mysterious nature. I began by reviewing the Ministry's files on Graham's background, but they were disappointingly sparse. It seemed that he had been recruited from a rather obscure historical period, and his personal history was shrouded in secrecy. I made a mental note to speak with his psychoanalyst again, to see if she had any additional insights to share. As I sat there, lost in thought, I heard a faint knock at the door. It was one of the Ministry's junior analysts, a bright and eager young woman named Sarah. She had a look of excitement on her face, and I could tell that she had something important to share. ""I think I've found something,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ""Something about Graham's past."" I leaned forward, my heart racing with anticipation, as she continued, ""It seems that he's not who he says he is."" I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized the implications of her words. Could it be true? Was Graham hiding a secret that could change everything? I knew I had to know more."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory. Every time I gave Graham a book, I was trying to shunt him along a story I’d been telling myself all my life.","something about her that made me want to peel away the layers of her carefully constructed persona, to reveal the person beneath, the one she kept hidden even from herself, and I found myself wondering what secrets she might be keeping, what stories she might be telling herself",101,"something about her that made me want to peel away the layers of her carefully constructed persona, to reveal the person beneath, the one she kept hidden even from herself, and I found myself wondering what secrets she might be keeping, what stories she might be telling herself about the world and her place in it, and whether she was as lost as I was, or if she had somehow managed to find her way, and if so, how, and what that might mean for me, and for us, and for the fragile, tentative connection we had formed."
Graham was adamant about not informing the Ministry about his illness. It was the closest I had,ever seen him to entreating. I thought about it a lot. I liked being entreated by him.,"seen him come close to revealing a secret, and I knew that if he did, it would be the end",34,"seen him come close to revealing a secret, and I knew that if he did, it would be the end of his career, not to mention the repercussions it would have on our entire operation, which had been going on for years without a single misstep."
"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled. Then again, whose upper management am I not describing? Who trusts their workplace? Who thinks their job is on the side of right? They fed us all poison from a bottle marked “prestige,” and we developed a high tolerance for bitterness. I would have been more frightened if the pressure lifted, like an indoor cat struck by sudden rain.","and I was young and foolish enough to believe her.

If I had only seen the truth behind her façade, I might have been able to prevent the tragedy that unfolded. But I didn't, and now I'm left to live with the consequences of my own naivety."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.","that I had managed to get my hands on the confidential documents, and what exactly I hoped to achieve by revealing",39,"that I had managed to get my hands on the confidential documents, and what exactly I hoped to achieve by revealing them to him."
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.","his fingers, staring out the window with an air of quiet contemplation that I had rarely seen in him before.

I hung my coat on the hook by the door and walked over to join him, feeling a sense of contentment wash over me as I took in the cozy scene before me. Graham looked up as I approached, a hint of a smile on his face, and I could see the tension in his shoulders begin to ease as he put out his cigarette and turned to face me."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers. He took in anecdotes about my childhood meals as if they would contribute to a portrait of a whole woman. He ignored the fact that mostly I cooked assorted chicken pieces on rice. I could tell him things about galangal, and he found that very profound.","that seemed to emanate from the depths of the galaxy, his pencil scratching furiously across the paper as he tried to capture the essence of the swirling patterns.

As I described the different ingredients and techniques, I could see the wheels turning in his mind, his eyes lighting up with excitement as he envisioned the possibilities of combining these flavors in new and innovative ways. His passion for art and food was infectious, and I found myself getting caught up in his enthusiasm, eager to explore the world of Southeast Asian cuisine with him and see where our culinary adventures would take us."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization. I wanted him in a role that didn’t require him to be at sea for months, possibly years,","at a time. It was too soon, I told myself. Whatever Adela said, he wasn’t ready, he’d barely left London, let alone land. But I wanted him to stay for other reasons too. It was humiliating to know that about myself and to say nothing into his implacable placidity.","as the thought of being away from our growing family for such extended periods weighed heavily on my mind.

We spent countless hours scouring the job listings, weighing the pros and cons of each opportunity, and discussing the potential impact on our future. The navy's offer was still on the table, but I couldn't shake the feeling that it was a path we were no longer suited for. I knew he was torn, and I couldn't blame him – the sea had been his home for so long, and the thought of leaving it behind was daunting. As we navigated this difficult decision, I couldn't help but wonder what the future held for us, and whether we would find a way to make our new life work."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.","was a song that Graham had always found to be a bit too sappy for his taste, but it somehow managed to perfectly capture the awkward, end-of-summer vibe that had settled over the group as they",64,"was a song that Graham had always found to be a bit too sappy for his taste, but it somehow managed to perfectly capture the awkward, end-of-summer vibe that had settled over the group as they stood there, unsure of what to do next."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes. One of his first searches was charmingly housewifely: “Most challenging recipes”; “How to make cheese soufflé”; “What is miso paste?”; “Where to buy miso paste”; “How long has Japan been open to Europe?” A day or so after I’d read this report, I received another that listed the following search terms:","of his gullibility, that he'd been browsing through every manner of salacious content, his innocent eyes drinking in the lurid details like a parched traveler at an oasis.

I envisioned the Ministry's stern-faced analysts poring over the data, their expressions a mixture of horror and fascination as they pieced together the trail of digital breadcrumbs leading from Graham's account to the seedier corners of the internet. And I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets he might be hiding, what other fetishes or fixations he might be harboring, all while maintaining a façade of wholesome, all-American normalcy. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I found myself questioning everything I thought I knew about my colleague, my friend, and my own judgment in trusting him with sensitive information. As I sat there, frozen in a mix of anxiety and trepidation, the cursor on my screen seemed to mock me, taunting me with its steady, unblinking gaze, as if daring me to click the button and unleash a torrent of secrets that would change everything."
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing,","as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday. This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option. We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit. Still, we had not told them about the death camps.","Blitz spirit, but it was more like Blitz chaos, with people rushing to secure their homes and businesses, some of them laughing and joking, while others looked worried and anxious.

Some of the shopkeepers were trying to salvage their stock, while others were boarding up their windows and doors. The smell of wet earth and ozone filled the air, and the sound of the rain was almost deafening. I quickened my pace, my heart pounding in my chest, as I wondered if I would make it to my car before the floodwaters reached it."

The email had been brief, but its impact was anything but. It was a single sentence, typed in a font that seemed to mock me with its cold, calculating precision: ""They're coming for you."" The words danced before my eyes, taunting me with their simplicity, their brutal honesty. I felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead as I read the words again, and again, and again, each time trying to will them away, to make them disappear like a bad dream. But they lingered, seared into my brain like a branding iron, refusing to be extinguished. And as I sat there, frozen in terror, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was running out of time."

The thing in my chest kicked again, and I felt a wave of nausea wash over me as I realized that I had no idea what was happening or how I had gotten there."
