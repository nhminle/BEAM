"Not quite the stuff of childhood dreams. Then again, I’m no dreamer. I only ever contemplated marriage once, back in the gloomy days of my childhood.

But as I grew older, I began to realize that perhaps my initial perception was skewed, and that marriage could be a beautiful, yet imperfect union between two people who loved and accepted each other for who they truly were. Little did I know, my own life was about to take a dramatic turn, one that would lead me down a path I never could have imagined, and force me to reevaluate everything I thought I knew about love, relationships, and the institution of marriage itself."
"That was fourteen years ago, though, and Serena never married me. In fact, she’s long gone.

I did try to arrange a meeting. Suggested to my people that they suggest to his people that we could grab lunch the week before the ceremony. Coffee the previous day. A glass of tap water the morning of—anything to avoid a “How do you do?” in front of the officiant.

My people, bless their well-meaning hearts, seemed to think that I was being overly cautious, that the tension between us was merely a minor blip on the radar of our otherwise harmonious relationship. But I knew better. I knew that one misstep, one awkward exchange, could set off a chain reaction of misunderstandings and hurt feelings that would be difficult to undo. So I persisted, trying to find a way to break the ice, to create a sense of ease and familiarity that would make our union feel more like a partnership and less like a carefully constructed facade."
"One of the agents stops us in front of the double doors that lead into the courtyard. “Councilman Lark, Miss Lark, one minute. They’re not quite ready for you.” We","wait side by side for a handful of uncomfortable moments, then Father turns to me.

As we enter the courtyard, the warm sunlight catches us off guard, a stark contrast to the cool, sterile atmosphere of the building we just left. The sound of birds chirping and the soft murmur of conversation carries on the breeze, and for a moment, I almost forget the purpose of our visit. But the imposing structure of the council chambers looming before us quickly brings me back to reality."

"The first things I notice are the two walls of windows, which is exactly what Father wants.

The sun may be forbidden to us, toxic always and deathly in large quantities, but that’s precisely why","we covet it with such intensity.

The windows Father has installed are not only a testament to his understanding of our needs but also a clever way to bring in natural light without posing a risk to our well-being. As I gaze out at the breathtaking view, I feel a sense of peace wash over me, a feeling that is both calming and exhilarating at the same time. The way the sunlight dances across the floor, casting intricate patterns on the walls, is almost mesmerizing, and I find myself getting lost in its beauty. It's a small luxury, perhaps, but one that I've grown accustomed to, and I'm grateful to Father for providing it for me. The rest of the room is just as impressive, with its sleek, modern furniture and state-of-the-art appliances, all designed with our unique needs in mind. I take a deep breath, feeling a sense of contentment wash over me, and make my way over to the kitchen to see what Father has prepared for me."
"“Whose? Yours? Are you going to . . .” I don’t bother finishing the sentence—the sheer thought is ludicrous. It’s not just weddings that have gone out of fashion hundreds of years ago, but the entire idea","of long-term relationships. As it turns out, when your species sucks at producing children, encouraging sexual walkabouts and the search for reproductively compatible partners takes precedence over romance. I doubt Vampyres were ever particularly romantic, anyway. “Whose?”","of romantic love as a grand, sweeping gesture, a notion that has been reduced to a quaint relic of a bygone era, a relic that only exists in the dusty pages of old novels and the saccharine lyrics of forgotten ballads.

But what if, I wonder, what if that's not the only way it has to be? What if, in this sea of cynicism and disillusionment, there's still a place for the grand, sweeping gestures, for the reckless abandon of the heart, for the thrill of the unknown, and the beauty of the unscripted? What if, in this world of carefully managed expectations, there's still a place for the messy, beautiful chaos of true love?"

"“Shit,” I mutter softly, rubbing the bridge of my nose. Was Moreland married before?

Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight if you want to know the truth."" The words sent a shiver down my spine as I realized that I had stumbled upon something much bigger than a simple blackmail scheme, something that could potentially bring down a powerful organization, and I knew I had to be careful not to get caught in the crossfire."
"And that’s when I did it: I kneeled in front of Serena’s damn fucking cat.

I looked up at Serena, my eyes pleading for understanding, but her expression was unreadable, her arms crossed over her chest, her eyes fixed on Whiskers, who was now sauntering away, tail twitching, as if he knew he'd been the center of attention, and was basking in it."
"The receipt, which wasn’t a balled-up receipt at all. It was a piece of paper","torn from a journal, or perhaps a notebook, or—no. A planner.

"Or maybe not quite. A distant bell rang, reminding me of a game Serena and I used to play as kids, a primitive substitution cipher we made up to gossip freely in front of our caregivers. We’d named it the butterfly alphabet, and","it mostly consisted of adding b- and f- syllables to normal words. Nothing complicated: even rusty as I was, it took my brain only a few seconds to untangle it. And once I was done, I had something.

Little did we know, that same game would one day become a vital tool in our adult lives, a way to communicate discreetly in a world where words were often laced with hidden meanings and double entendres."
"I didn’t scream, or cry, or attack that old hag.

As the game's story unfolded, the Collateral's character became increasingly complex, with some players speculating about its true purpose and motivations. The developers were torn between maintaining the character's original intention as a nonplayable character and giving it a more significant role in the game, which would require significant changes to the story and gameplay mechanics. This internal debate continued for several months, with some team members arguing that the Collateral's expanded role would enhance the game's replay value and others believing that it would detract from the game's overall coherence. In the end, the decision was made to introduce the Collateral as a playable character in a downloadable content pack, which would allow players to experience the character's story and abilities firsthand. The pack was a huge success, and the Collateral's popularity soared, leading to further discussions about its potential inclusion in future games within the same universe."
