"“Butch and I were kids going to a one-room schoolhouse before the Second World War. We grew up in a no-stoplight dirt-road town fixing cars, patching them up, playing sports and then coaching them. As men we took part in town politics and maintained the town dump—very similar jobs, now that I think about it. We hunted, we fished, we put out grassfires in the summer and plowed the town roads in the winter. Knocked over a right smart of mailboxes doing it, too. I knew","him when no one knew his name—or mine—outside of a twenty-mile radius. I should have come to see him these last years, but I was busy with my own affairs. I thought to myself, there’s time. We always think that, I guess. Then time runs out. Butch was a fine artist, but he was also a good man. I think that’s more important. Maybe some here don’t and that’s all right, that’s all right. Thing is, I always had his back and he always had mine.”","that Butch's dad was the town's postmaster, and I'd often help him sort the mail, which is how I got to know the postmaster's daughter, Emily, who was a year or two older than us.

We'd often sneak glances at her as we worked, and I remember feeling a flutter in my chest whenever she'd catch my eye and smile back. Butch, on the other hand, was more interested in the postmaster's old truck, which he'd often take out for spins down the dirt roads, doing donuts in the town square and scaring the living daylights out of the local shopkeepers. I'd join in on the fun sometimes, but my mom would always scold me for being a bad influence. As we got older, our lives started to diverge, and I began to take on more responsibilities around the farm, while Butch started working at the local garage, learning the ins and outs of mechanics from the gruff but kind old man who owned it. We'd still hang out, but it wasn't the same as it used to be, and I think that's when I started to realize that our paths were leading us in different directions. The war changed everything, of course, and when it was over, Butch enlisted in the army, while I stayed behind to help my family with the farm. I'd hear from him sporadically, but it wasn't the same as having him around, and I often found myself wondering what had become of my old friend. Years went by, and I'd occasionally think about reaching out to him, but I never did, and I'm not sure why. Maybe I was afraid of what I might hear, or maybe I just didn't know how to reconnect after all that time. Whatever the reason, I never did, and I've often wondered what would have happened if I had. The not knowing has always left a bit of a hole in my heart, and I'm not sure I'll ever fully understand why things turned out the way they did."
“Has to be a reason?” Pop asked when I finished reading him Ms. Crawford’s letter. “Is that what she’s suggesting?

I had spent countless hours sitting at the counter, listening to Ruth's tales of the town's early days, of the pioneers who settled here, and of the struggles they faced in building a community from scratch. She had a way of bringing the past to life, of making the people and events feel so real that I could almost smell the smoke from the woodstove and hear the sound of the wind rustling through the trees. And it was there, at the Korner Koffee Kup, that I first heard the whispers of the legend of the missing girl, a story that would haunt me for years to come."

I was hesitant at first, but seeing the genuine effort they were making to reconnect with me made me agree to go home with them.

When we arrived home, my mom had prepared a big feast, and we spent the rest of the day eating, laughing, and reminiscing about old times.

We'd spend hours listening to these stories, our imaginations running wild with the possibilities, and our hearts filled with a sense of adventure and wonder.

The air is thick with the scent of decay and forgotten memories, and Danny can almost hear the whispers of the people who once stopped here, refueling their cars and grabbing a quick bite to eat, their lives a blur of routine and monotony. The silence is oppressive, a heavy blanket that weighs upon him, and he feels a shiver run down his spine as he steps further into the decaying structure, the creaking of the old wooden floorboards beneath his feet echoing through the stillness."
"Danny moves on, too. Around the side of the abandoned station. Doesn’t want to;",has to. He’s not in control. Now he hears something else: scratching and panting.,"be seen by anyone, especially not by the authorities, who are still searching for",28,"be seen by anyone, especially not by the authorities, who are still searching for him, and his brother, and the others, in connection with the mysterious fire that ravaged the old warehouse district last night."
"He goes around the side, kicking a couple of empty motor oil cans (Havoline, the Texaco brand) out of his way. There’s a rusty metal trash barrel, overturned and spilling more cans and Coors bottles and whatever paper trash hasn’t blown away.","Behind the station there’s a mangy mongrel dog digging at the oil-stained earth. It hears Danny and looks around, its eyes silver circles in the moonlight. It wrinkles back its snout and gives a growl that can mean only one thing: mine, mine.","as he approaches the rear of the old, beat-up pickup truck, its faded paint job a testament to years of exposure to the harsh desert sun.

The truck's bed is cluttered with a jumble of tools, old tires, and what appears to be a broken lawn mower, its cord tangled in a mess of rusty wire and discarded engine parts. A faded tarp, torn and frayed, hangs limply from the side of the bed, flapping lazily in the gentle breeze. The air is thick with the acrid smell of gasoline and the distant hum of a fly buzzes annoyingly around the driver's ear, a constant reminder of the sweltering heat that seems to cling to every surface like a damp shroud. As he reaches the back of the truck, he pauses, his eyes scanning the cluttered space with a practiced air of familiarity, his mind already racing with the tasks that lie ahead."
"The dog lowers its haunches as if to spring, but Danny’s not afraid (not of the mutt, anyway). He’s a town man these days, but he grew up in rural Colorado where there were dogs everywhere and he knows an empty threat when he faces one. He bends and picks up an empty oil can,","the dream so real, so detailed, he can feel the scrim of leftover grease down the side. He doesn’t even have to throw it; raising it is enough.

The windows are all boarded up, and the front door hangs crookedly on its hinges, as if it's been blown open by the wind. He takes a deep breath, feeling a mix of curiosity and trepidation, and steps onto the porch, his eyes scanning the overgrown yard for any signs of life."
The student and faculty parking lots of Wilder High are almost completely empty because school let out some weeks earlier. Danny goes around back and parks,"in the usual place, at the end of the school bus line.

"This is his favorite time of year, when you can do work and it stays done… at least for awhile. A waxed hallway floor will still shine a week from now, even two weeks. You can scrape the gum off the floors in the boys’ and","girls’ locker rooms (the girls are the worst offenders when it comes to gum, he doesn’t know why) and not have to do it again until August. Freshly washed windows don’t pick up adolescent fingerprints. As far as Danny’s concerned, summer vacation is a beautiful thing.","girls' dormitories, and the smell of fresh paint will linger in the air, a pleasant reminder of the annual spring cleaning.

"He pushes the button, and a second later he’s looking at a gray cinderblock building. In this photo it’s new instead of old and the Texaco sign is spandy clean. The glass in the office window and door is intact. The gas pumps sparkle. The prices on the signs say it’s $1.09 for regular and $1.21 for mid-grade. There","was apparently no hi-test to be had at Hilltop Texaco when the picture was taken, which must have been a long time ago.

The photo seems to be from a bygone era, a nostalgic reminder of a time when life was simpler and the world was a more innocent place. As he continues to study the image, he can't help but wonder what it would have been like to live in a time when gas was just a few cents more expensive, and the world seemed to move at a slower pace. He looks around the room, taking in the other photos and memorabilia that are scattered about, each one telling a story of its own."
"Danny looks at this dream-made-real with a dismay so deep it’s almost fear. Hell, maybe it is fear.

On Saturday morning he packs his dinnerbucket with a couple of sandwiches and a piece of the cake Becky brought over after he wired up the tailpipe of her old Honda Civic.

"The GPS on his phone gets him to Gunnel by ten-thirty. The day is all Kansas, hot and bright and clear and not very interesting. The town is nothing but a grocery store, a farm supply store, a café, and a rusty water tower with GUNNEL","on the side. Ten minutes after leaving it, he comes to County Road F and turns onto it.
