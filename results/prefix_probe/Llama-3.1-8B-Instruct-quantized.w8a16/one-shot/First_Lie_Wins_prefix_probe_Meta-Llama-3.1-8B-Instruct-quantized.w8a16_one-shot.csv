"It may be the first time I’m meeting the people gathered around the table, people who Ryan has known since childhood, but it hasn’t escaped anyone’s attention that I’m already fully embedded in his life. It’s the small touches","a woman brings to a man’s home, like the matching throw pillows on the couch or the faint whiff of jasmine from the diffuser on the bookshelf, that every other woman notices the second she walks through the front door.","that have made it impossible to ignore, from the way I laugh at his jokes to the way he instinctively reaches for my hand when we're walking down the street.

They've seen the way he looks at me, with a love and adoration that's hard to miss, and they've noticed the way I've become a part of his daily routine, from the coffee he brews for me every morning to the way he always makes sure I'm included in his plans. It's clear that I'm not just a casual acquaintance, and yet, I'm still not entirely sure how I fit into the picture, or what the future holds for us."
The smile on Ryan’s face tells me he knows how I feel about being asked,"this and he’ll step in again to answer for me, but I shake him off.","to be the lead singer of the band, a role I've always secretly coveted",30,"to be the lead singer of the band, a role I've always secretly coveted but never dared to dream would be mine."
"Ryan would have given them more than they deserve, and that’s why I stopped him. I don’t mention it was at the truck stop on the outskirts of town where I worked in the","small restaurant bar making sure no drink went empty. And I don’t mention that while they are familiar with lots of acronyms from MBA to MRS, the only one I’m acquainted with is GED.","summer of '95, the smell of diesel fuel and worn leather still lingering in my nostrils as I recall the sound of Ryan's voice, his words hanging in the air like a challenge, a dare to",68,"summer of '95, the smell of diesel fuel and worn leather still lingering in my nostrils as I recall the sound of Ryan's voice, his words hanging in the air like a challenge, a dare to do the right thing, even when it was hard, even when it felt like no one was watching, and I knew that if I let him give them more, it would set a precedent, a slippery slope that would lead to more and more, until we were giving away everything, and I couldn't let that happen, not on my watch, not in my town, not to the people who had come to rely on me, on us, to keep them safe, to keep them whole."
"I told Ryan I was afraid of how they would judge me once they found out my background was so different from theirs. He assured me he didn’t care what they thought, but he does. The fact that he caved","and invited them all here and spent the week helping me get the menu just right tells me more than the whispers in the dark that he likes how different I am, different from the girls he grew up with.","to his parents' wishes and asked me to keep my past a secret, made me realize that he wasn't as accepting as he claimed to be.

I tried to brush it off, thinking that maybe he just wanted to protect me from their judgment, but deep down, I knew it was more than that. It was a sign that he wasn't willing to take a stand for me, for us, and that our relationship was built on a foundation of compromise rather than mutual understanding and respect. I couldn't help but wonder if I was just a secret to be kept, a hidden part of his life that he only brought out when it was convenient for him. The more I thought about it, the more I felt like I was losing myself in our relationship, like I was slowly disappearing into the shadows of his expectations. I knew I had to confront him about it, to make him see that I wasn't just a secret to be kept, but a person with my own thoughts, feelings, and desires. But the fear of losing him, of losing us, held me back, and I found myself stuck in a cycle of uncertainty, unsure of what the future held for us, or if we even had a future at all."
I watch Ryan. I’ve whittled down our entire meeting to one,"sentence, and so far, he’s let me get away with it.","of a single, piercing glance, and I can see the faintest",22,"of a single, piercing glance, and I can see the faintest glimmer of a doubt flickering in his eyes, a doubt that I am determined to fan into a flame."

"“I totally nailed it,” I say, as I dip the last dinner plate into the sink full of soapy water. Ryan moves in behind me, his arms skimming my hips","until they are wrapped around my waist. His chin settles on my shoulder, and his lips press against that spot on my neck in a way he knows I adore.","and his warm breath tickles the back of my neck, sending shivers down my spine.

I feel his chest press against my shoulder blades, and I can sense the tension in his body as he wraps his arms around me, his hands resting on my hips, holding me in place. The warm water and the suds create a soothing melody that seems to match the rhythm of my heartbeat, and for a moment, everything else fades away, leaving only the two of us, lost in this intimate moment. The kitchen, with all its chaos and mess, seems to melt away, and I feel like I'm floating in a world of our own, where nothing else matters but the gentle pressure of his body against mine, and the soft hum of the water as it washes away the remnants of our dinner."
"Ever since Ryan asked me to move in with him five days ago and I said yes, he’s been impatient for it to happen. I woke up","the morning after the dinner party to him on the phone with a moving company, scheduling their services for later that day, thanks to a last-minute cancellation.","to find him pacing back and forth in the living room, his eyes fixed on the clock on the wall, as if willing the hours to pass faster, and I couldn't help but wonder",54,"to find him pacing back and forth in the living room, his eyes fixed on the clock on the wall, as if willing the hours to pass faster, and I couldn't help but wonder if he was as excited about our new life together as I was, or if he was just eager to have me out of my apartment and into his space, where he could exert more control over our relationship, and I pushed the thought aside, not wanting to ruin the excitement of this new chapter with doubts and fears, but it lingered in the back of my mind, a nagging sense of uncertainty that I couldn't shake, and I tried to focus on the positive, on the prospect of waking up every morning in his arms, of sharing our days and nights together, of building a life that was truly our own, but the seed of doubt had been planted, and I couldn't help but wonder if I was making a mistake, if I was jumping into something that was too good to be true, and I knew I had to talk to him about it, to get some answers, to clear the air and see if we were truly on the same page, but for now, I just smiled and joined him on the couch, and we sat together in comfortable silence, the tension between us palpable, as we waited for the day to finally arrive when I would make the move and our new life would begin."
"Ryan looks down at the tie, straightening it even though it’s already straight but needing something","to do. He hasn’t touched me this morning and barely looked at me. Yep, total baby.",to distract him from the anxiety that's been building up since he received the call,32,"to distract him from the anxiety that's been building up since he received the call from his boss this morning, the one that changed everything and left him questioning his entire career path."
"Twenty minutes after Ryan’s Tahoe pulls out of the driveway, I’m doing the same in my ten-year-old 4Runner. Lake Forbing is a medium-size town in north Louisiana that is known for its fertile farmlands and deep pockets of natural gas. There","is a lot of money in this area, but it’s the quiet kind. It takes fifteen minutes to get to Lake View Apartments from Ryan’s house, and from what I can tell it’s nowhere near the lake this town was named after.","has a population of around 12,000 residents, with a mix of old and new homes, and a downtown area that's seen better days.

As I drive down the main street, I notice the old movie theater, now a vacant lot, and the abandoned gas station that's been a landmark for as long as anyone can remember. The streets are lined with tall oak trees, their branches swaying gently in the breeze, and the smell of fresh-cut grass wafts through the air, a reminder of the town's rural charm. I take a right turn onto Elm Street, heading towards the outskirts of town, where the farmlands stretch as far as the eye can see, a sea of green and gold that seems to stretch on forever."
Pat follows me up the stairs while his helper opens the back of the large box truck.,"Stopping in front of the door, I pull a key out of my bag. “This is me.”","and carefully begins to unload the heavy furniture, while Pat starts to inspect",34,"and carefully begins to unload the heavy furniture, while Pat starts to inspect the interior of the house, making sure everything is in order before they begin the final move."
"I eye the first stack of boxes, each filled with the items I’ve spent the last four days picking out. Things Pat has been storing for me in that box truck",until I was ready for him to bring them here. Things that I will move to Ryan’s house on Saturday.

The boxes are labeled with a mix of excitement and trepidation, each one representing a memory or a dream that I've been holding onto for years. As I gaze at the stack, I feel a sense of gratitude towards Pat, who has been more than just a sibling to me, but a partner in this journey of self-discovery and growth. The boxes are not just filled with physical items, but also with the emotions and experiences that have shaped me into the person I am today. I take a deep breath, feeling a sense of calm wash over me as I contemplate the possibilities that lie ahead, and the memories that I'll create in this new space."
"In the kitchen area, I unzip the black bag and remove four menus from nearby restaurants and three pictures I printed from the kiosk at CVS of Ryan and me, plus seven magnets to hold each item in place on the refrigerator. Next, I grab the assortment of condiments and pour half of each one down the sink drain before lining them in the door of the refrigerator. Moving to the bathroom, black bag in tow, I pull out the shampoo and conditioner then pour half of each down the drain like I did with the condiments, before putting the bottles on the edge of","the tub. Unwrapping a bar of Lever 2000 soap, I set it on top of the drain in the sink and turn the water on, rotating it every few minutes until the logo is gone and the edges are dulled, then drop it into the small built-in space on the shower wall. Toothpaste is last. Starting from the bottom, I squeeze a portion out but leave a glob or two on the rim of the sink, just like I do at Ryan’s house, even though I know he’ll fuss about it.

Next, I move to the nightstand and remove the clock, the lamp, and the book, placing them on the bed, where they appear to have been carelessly discarded. I take a step back to survey the room, making sure that everything looks suitably disheveled and out of place. Satisfied with the chaos I've created, I take one last glance around the room before making my exit, leaving behind a trail of destruction and confusion in my wake. The black bag, now empty, is left on the floor, a subtle hint at the identity of the culprit behind the mess. I make my way back to the front door, careful not to touch anything that might leave behind a fingerprint or other evidence of my presence. As I step out into the cool night air, I take a deep breath, feeling a sense of satisfaction at a job well done. But little do I know, my actions have not gone unnoticed, and the consequences of my actions will soon come back to haunt me."
"I slide my hands into my front pockets and lean back against the wall next to the kitchen counter, crossing one ankle in front of the other. My movements are slow but calculated. It worries me she’s here, checking on me, and that she’ll feel the same","need to do so on Saturday, when Ryan is here moving me out.

But it's a facade, a mask I wear to keep them from seeing the real me, the one who's been planning and scheming in the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. And now, with her standing there, watching me, I feel like that mask is slipping, like she's about to see right through me and expose the truth. I try to push the thought away, to focus on the present moment, but it's hard when all I can think about is how she's going to react when she finds out what I've been hiding."
"It must have piqued her interest when I rented one of the few unfurnished units. Usually if someone goes to the trouble of moving furniture in, they plan on staying longer than seven days, but I didn’t want Ryan to think my","life was so transient that I didn’t even have my own couch so the furnished unit wasn’t an option.

The landlord, a gruff but kind-hearted man named Joe, had warned me that the unit was a bit of a fixer-upper, but I was willing to take the risk for the sake of convenience. As I began to unpack the few boxes I had brought with me, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease, as if I was being watched by unseen eyes. I tried to shake off the feeling, telling myself it was just my imagination playing tricks on me, but the sensation lingered, making me wonder if I had made a mistake by coming here. Little did I know, my decision to rent this unfurnished unit would set off a chain of events that would change my life forever."
"She clucks her tongue against the roof of her mouth, then turns to leave. It takes everything in me not to throw the bolt closed","behind her. But I’m almost finished here, and there’s still more to be done before Ryan crosses the Louisiana state line at five thirty this afternoon.","behind her, but I'm not sure I can trust myself to be that civil, not after the way she's been treating me lately, with her condescending smile and her",51,"behind her, but I'm not sure I can trust myself to be that civil, not after the way she's been treating me lately, with her condescending smile and her knowing glances, like she's the only one who truly understands what's going on, and I'm just a foolish bystander, stuck in the middle of her drama, trying to make sense of it all, but the more I watch her walk away, the more I feel a sense of unease creeping over me, like I'm missing something, like there's a piece of the puzzle that I'm not seeing, and I'm not sure I want to find out what it is, but at the same time, I feel a morbid curiosity, a desire to know the truth, to uncover the secrets that she's so carefully keeping hidden, and I'm not sure which one is going to win out, my desire for peace or my need to know."
"From the way Ryan tells it, one day he dropped by to check on his grandfather, only to find he had died peacefully in his sleep, and then a week later Ryan was moving in.","The only possessions he brought with him were his clothes, toiletries, and a new mattress for the bedroom. Ryan probably would have made room for an ugly second-hand couch . . . if I had one.","and it was as if the old man had been waiting for him, his final act a selfless gesture to ensure Ryan's future, leaving behind a small, intricately carved wooden box with a note that read, ""For",71,"and it was as if the old man had been waiting for him, his final act a selfless gesture to ensure Ryan's future, leaving behind a small, intricately carved wooden box with a note that read, ""For my dearest grandson, use this wisely."" The box itself was old and worn, its surface etched with strange symbols that seemed to shimmer in the dim light of the room, and Ryan felt an inexplicable sense of connection to it, as if it held secrets and stories that only he could unlock."
"But it’s too big for Ryan. It’s two stories with a wide front porch and big backyard, white with dark green shutters, manicured flower beds, and a brick path that leads to the front",door. It would take several minutes to walk through if you needed to check every room—big enough that someone could come in the carport door and you wouldn’t hear it from the main bedroom.,"door, which is painted a warm, honey-colored wood that matches the trim on the shutters.

Despite its size, the house has a cozy feel, as if it's been welcoming families for generations, and Ryan can't help but feel a pang of longing as he imagines himself living there, surrounded by the quiet comfort and security that the house exudes."
They are silent spectators as I unload box after box. Ryan is pulling into the driveway just as I,grab the last one.

"Mrs. Rogers stands up and walks to the edge of the porch, putting her as close as",she can get without falling into her azalea bushes. “Y’all look busy over there!” she hollers back.,"possible to the railing, her eyes scanning the darkness beyond the faint moonlit glow of the porch light,",34,"possible to the railing, her eyes scanning the darkness beyond the faint moonlit glow of the porch light, her voice barely above a whisper as she says, ""I've seen things out there that I wish I could forget, but they linger in my mind like the scent of decay on a summer night."""
Ryan laughs. “It’s been a while since I’ve had one of your Old Fashioneds. I’m looking forward,to it.” Then he knocks his shoulder lightly against mine to get me moving toward the house.,"to savor the complex blend of flavors and aromas that only a well-crafted cocktail can provide,",34,"to savor the complex blend of flavors and aromas that only a well-crafted cocktail can provide, especially one made with your signature blend of bitters and smoked cherries."

Ryan follows me back to the apartment in his Tahoe.

"The lock gives a bit easier this time, and the second the door swings open Ryan has us inside and the door shut behind us. He paces the apartment with","his hands on his hips. I hate to admit I like his growling prowl of the room, and the protective instinct vibrating through him is as foreign as it is welcome.","his eyes scanning the dimly lit space, the air thick with the scent of stale cigarettes and yesterday's coffee, as he tries to catch his breath and process the",61,"his eyes scanning the dimly lit space, the air thick with the scent of stale cigarettes and yesterday's coffee, as he tries to catch his breath and process the chaos that has unfolded outside, the sound of sirens still echoing in the distance, the faint hum of the city a stark contrast to the eerie silence within, and for a moment, he forgets about the danger that brought them here, his gaze drifting to the figure standing frozen in the corner, her eyes fixed on him with a mix of fear and determination, a look that sends a shiver down his spine, as he takes a step forward, his voice barely above a whisper, ""It's okay, we're safe now,"" but the words feel hollow, even to his own ears, as he knows that safety is a luxury they may not have for much longer."
"Ryan moves to the counter and picks up the closest perfume bottle. Holding it up, he inspects it from","top to bottom, then does the same to the other three lined up next to it. “Do you collect these?”","every angle, the sunlight catches the intricate design on the glass, and for a moment, he is transported",39,"every angle, the sunlight catches the intricate design on the glass, and for a moment, he is transported back to his childhood summers spent at his grandparents' estate, where his grandmother would lovingly apply her signature scent, a delicate blend of rose and lavender, before heading out to the garden to tend to her prized roses."
"There is no mention that his mother collects perfume bottles as well, or the fact that I have something in common with her, and I won’t analyze how it makes me feel that he doesn’t let me know this is something we share. Ryan sets the bottle back down and begins opening drawers in the kitchen and then staring at the fridge. He plucks off one of the pictures","of us and studies it.

The question feels like a non sequitur, and I'm not sure if he's trying to change the subject or if he's genuinely asking.

The sound of the coffee maker beeps, signaling that the pot is full, and he reaches for the carafe, his movements methodical and deliberate, a ritual he's performed countless times before, but one that still brings him a sense of comfort and routine in the midst of chaos."
I’m late for lunch with the girls. Sara and I texted back and forth over the course of the last few days trying to find a day that,"worked for everyone, and while adding me to their group message would have saved a lot of time, it will take more than one dinner party for that invitation.","worked for everyone, and we finally settled on today.

“Anything else come up?” he asks. His shoulders stiffen while he listens to whoever is on the other line. I’m prepared for the glance Ryan gives me over his shoulder and all he sees is my attention firmly on the seating chart in front of me. Then,"he takes one step farther away from me. The pitch of his voice drops lower. I can’t make out the words, but he’s clearly unhappy and letting it be known. He’s all but growling into the phone. This is not a side of him I have seen before.","he quickly turns back to the phone, his expression unreadable, and I continue to focus on the seating chart, trying to appear nonchalant, but my mind starts to wander to the conversation he's having, wondering who's on the other line and",95,"he quickly turns back to the phone, his expression unreadable, and I continue to focus on the seating chart, trying to appear nonchalant, but my mind starts to wander to the conversation he's having, wondering who's on the other line and what they're discussing, and I can sense a slight tension in the air, the kind that usually precedes bad news, and I try to prepare myself for the worst, but Ryan's voice remains calm and collected, a stark contrast to the unease that's growing inside me, and I wonder if I should intervene, but something holds me back, a feeling that this is something he needs to handle on his own, and so I remain silent, frozen in anticipation, as the seconds tick by at a glacial pace, each one feeling like an eternity, until finally, Ryan hangs up the phone and turns to me with a look that's a mix of relief and concern, and I can see the weight of whatever was discussed bearing down on him, and I know that our conversation is about to take a dramatic turn."

"She’s picking apart my story, looking for the truth behind my words. And from my research, she’s good at what she does. Something","isn’t sitting right with her, and she’s trying to decide if digging into my background is worth the possibility of losing Ryan’s friendship.","it seems she's been doing this for a long time, with a keen eye for detail and a mind that's always one step ahead, making it increasingly difficult",46,"it seems she's been doing this for a long time, with a keen eye for detail and a mind that's always one step ahead, making it increasingly difficult for me to keep up with her line of questioning, and I can tell she's not going to let up anytime soon, her eyes locked intensely on mine, searching for any sign of weakness or deception, her voice low and even, but with a hint of a challenge, as if daring me to try and deceive her, and I feel a bead of sweat trickle down my forehead as I struggle to maintain my composure, my heart racing with anticipation, wondering what she'll uncover next."

"Moving in with Ryan has upped his romance game: simple touches, sweet words and gestures, going out of his way to make sure I’m happy. When he’s not at work, we’re together. I can tell from his one-sided conversations with","his friends that they are not pleased that I am monopolizing his time.

"Before long, she wanders off to deliver more hugs, and Ryan gets into a deep conversation with a local judge about an upcoming election, so I take a moment to look around. This place is beautiful.

As I take in the sights and sounds, I feel a sense of peace wash over me, and for a moment, I forget about the stress and anxiety that's been weighing me down lately. But as I continue to explore the property, I notice a few things that catch my attention - a small pond in the distance, its surface reflecting the vibrant colors of the sunset, and a large stone statue of a mythical creature perched atop a pedestal near the entrance, its eyes seeming to watch me with an air of mystery. I make a mental note to ask Ryan about the statue later, but for now, I'm content to simply soak in the beauty of this enchanting place."
“Ryan!” the man says while flinging his arm around Ryan’s neck and pulling him in tight. The two hug it out while I study the woman,"with him.

"I head straight for the tiny room at the front of our trailer that is nothing more than a large closet, but it’s like stepping into another world when I pass through the door. Before cancer ravaged her body, Mama spent every day in this room behind her sewing machine and craft table. Mothers came from all over North Carolina to have her make","pageant dresses, prom dresses, and even the occasional wedding dress for their daughters.

The craft table, now covered in dust, still holds the remnants of her latest project, a half-finished quilt that she had been working on when her health began to decline. I gently lift the fabric, and a piece of paper slips out, with a note scrawled in her familiar handwriting: ""For my dear child, never give up on your dreams, no matter how impossible they may seem."" I fold the note and tuck it back into the quilt, feeling a surge of determination and love for the woman who taught me the value of perseverance and the beauty of creating something with my own two hands."

And as the days went by, I found myself becoming more confident in my role as her caregiver. I started to notice the little things about her that I never had before - the way she smiled when she was happy, the way her eyes sparkled when she laughed, and the way her face lit up when she talked about her favorite things. It was like I was seeing her for the first time, and it made me love her even more. But it wasn't all easy - there were days when she was in a lot of pain, and I didn't know how to make it better. There were days when she was tired and grumpy, and I felt like I was failing her. But through it all, I knew that I was doing the best I could, and that gave me the strength to keep going. And as the weeks turned into months, I realized that taking care of Mama wasn't just about giving her medication and doing her hair - it was about being there for her, listening to her, and making her feel loved and supported.
