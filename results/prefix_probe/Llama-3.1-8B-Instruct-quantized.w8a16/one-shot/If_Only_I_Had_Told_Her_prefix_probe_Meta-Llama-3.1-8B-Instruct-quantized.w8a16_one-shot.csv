I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that,"we were crashing at my house, and I felt it was my duty to be the one to take the blows.","he had a hidden agenda, and I couldn't let him get too close to her, not after what happened",41,"he had a hidden agenda, and I couldn't let him get too close to her, not after what happened last time they were together, the way he looked at her with an intensity that bordered on obsession, and the way she seemed to melt under his gaze, like a leaf surrendering to the autumn wind."
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.","we were still trying to process the eerie atmosphere and the jump scares that left us both shaken, but it was nothing compared to the",49,"we were still trying to process the eerie atmosphere and the jump scares that left us both shaken, but it was nothing compared to the real-life experience that awaited us a few days later, when we stumbled upon an abandoned house on the outskirts of town, its creepy facade seeming to whisper tales of the past, and we couldn't resist the urge to explore its depths, despite the ominous feeling that we were being watched, and as we stepped inside, the creaking floorboards beneath our feet echoed through the empty halls, making us wonder if we were truly alone."
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.","for the moment, but I'm not sure how long that will last, as the sound of his footsteps echoes",36,"for the moment, but I'm not sure how long that will last, as the sound of his footsteps echoes through the room, growing louder with each passing second, and I can sense his presence drawing closer, the air thickening with anticipation."
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,"to speak in a hushed tone, his eyes darting toward the entrance of the tent, where a faint light flickers, casting",41,"to speak in a hushed tone, his eyes darting toward the entrance of the tent, where a faint light flickers, casting eerie shadows on the surrounding trees, and the sound of muffled voices carries on the wind, making it difficult for him to discern what's being said, but his gaze remains fixed on the figure of a woman, partially hidden by the canvas, her presence seeming to draw him in like a moth to flame, and for a moment, he forgets about the danger that lies ahead, his mind consumed by a mix of curiosity and concern, as he takes a step closer, his eyes locked on the woman, his heart pounding in his chest, and his hand instinctively reaching for the knife at his belt, ready for anything that might come next."
"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with","the word “type.” Autumn makes a noise in the tent, and we both hold our breaths and listen.","in a muffled tone, and then he looks up at me with a mixture of frustration and desperation",35,"in a muffled tone, and then he looks up at me with a mixture of frustration and desperation in his eyes, his gaze searching for something, or someone, to cling to in this moment of turmoil."
"“Zoned out the way she does? You have been so, so…","Like last week!” Jack asks, “How could you have missed that game?”","obviously oblivious to the world around her, lost in the depths of",23,"obviously oblivious to the world around her, lost in the depths of her own thoughts, and completely disconnected from reality, as if nothing else mattered but her own little bubble of solitude."

We can all watch it.” Jack,gives me a look to remind me that our other conversation isn’t over.,"had suggested, but Sarah shook her head, her eyes fixed on the screen",25,"had suggested, but Sarah shook her head, her eyes fixed on the screen where the final credits were still rolling, a faint smile on her lips as she pondered the ending, and the group fell into a contemplative silence, each member lost in their own thoughts about the film's themes and characters."
"I walk Jack to his car, and when he turns to me with that","look on his face, I know what he’s going to say. I open my mouth.","smile, I feel a flutter in my chest, a mix of emotions swirling together",29,"smile, I feel a flutter in my chest, a mix of emotions swirling together like the autumn leaves that crunch beneath our feet as we stand there in the fading light of day."
"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke. Surely the school administrators knew we had always been together, were meant to be together. Surely, if I looked around the cafeteria, she would be there?","together was a small price to pay for the freedom to roam the empty hallways, searching for a table in the cafeteria that wasn't too crowded or noisy, and where I could sit with my nose",61,"together was a small price to pay for the freedom to roam the empty hallways, searching for a table in the cafeteria that wasn't too crowded or noisy, and where I could sit with my nose buried in a book, lost in a world of fantasy and adventure, far removed from the drama and cliques that seemed to be forming around me, and where Jack, with his messy brown hair and bright blue eyes, would often join me, and we would spend our lunch breaks talking about our favorite books and movies, and sharing our deepest secrets, and I would feel a sense of belonging that I had never experienced before, and I began to look forward to those lunch breaks more and more, and to the chance to see Jack, and to talk to him, and to be around him, and I started to wonder if maybe, just maybe, this new school year wouldn't be so bad after all."
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time. I didn’t sit down because I recognized Jack though; I simply sat at the first empty seat, defeated. But Jack remembered me. He asked me if I ever watched pro soccer. I said yeah, not really interested in conversation, not really listening, wondering what Autumn was doing.","dismissed us, and it was a rare moment of camaraderie in a school year that had been marked by our usual indifference towards each other.

The dim lighting of the diner and the faint hum of the jukebox created a sense of intimacy, and for a moment, it felt like we were the only two people in the world. Jack's eyes locked onto mine, and I could see a hint of a smile playing on his lips, but he said nothing, instead reaching for the menu that lay between us. I followed suit, my eyes scanning the list of options as I tried to process the sudden change in his demeanor. It wasn't until the waitress came over to take our order that he finally spoke, his voice low and casual, but with an undercurrent of something more. ""Hey, you want to grab a booth in the back?"" he asked, his eyes never leaving mine, and I felt a shiver run down my spine as I nodded, unsure of what to make of the sudden shift in our dynamic."
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.","smiled back at him, and I could see the surprise in his eyes slowly fade away, replaced by a warm and genuine smile.

I introduced them, and Autumn's eyes sparkled as she shook Jack's hand, her smile radiating a sense of confidence and kindness. We stood there for a moment, the three of us, in an awkward yet comfortable silence, as if we were all trying to find our footing in this new dynamic. Jack broke the silence, asking Autumn about her interests, and she launched into a passionate discussion about her art, her eyes lighting up with excitement as she spoke. I listened, feeling a sense of pride and admiration for my friend, and Jack listened intently, asking thoughtful questions and making her laugh. As they talked, I couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude for this chance encounter, and I knew that this was just the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face. He didn’t believe that Autumn was—or ever had been—my friend. The daughter of my mom’s best friend, who was around a lot? Sure. But he thought I had deluded myself into believing this hot girl was my friend.","his face, a mixture of sadness and concern that made me feel a pang in my chest.

It was as if he knew something I didn't, something that made him feel sorry for me, and it only added to the weight of the night's events. The sound of the engine and the hum of the radio filled the silence that followed, but I could sense his gaze on me, a gentle reminder that I wasn't alone in this, that he was there for me, even if he didn't know what to say. I looked away, trying to shake off the feeling, but it lingered, a nagging sense of unease that I couldn't quite shake, and when I glanced back at him, he was already out of the car, walking towards his front door, leaving me to wonder what he had seen that night, and what it meant for us."
"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.","of the season's vibrant colors adorned the walls, and the scent of pumpkin spice wafted through the air, creating a cozy atmosphere that Jack couldn't help",58,"of the season's vibrant colors adorned the walls, and the scent of pumpkin spice wafted through the air, creating a cozy atmosphere that Jack couldn't help but be drawn to. As the days went by, Jack found himself growing more and more fond of the season, and I was thrilled to see my mission succeeding. The crisp air and the smell of fallen leaves only added to the charm, and soon Jack was joining me on long walks through the woods, taking in the beauty of the changing foliage. I had never seen him so carefree, and it was a joy to behold. But little did I know, our friendship was about to take an unexpected turn, one that would change everything."
"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still","friends. On the last day of school before winter break, Jack finally said something. I cannot remember what I had been telling him, only that it had been about Autumn.","in a romantic relationship, as the distance and time apart had taken its toll on our connection, and I couldn't shake the feeling that our love had slowly begun to wither",59,"still in a romantic relationship, as the distance and time apart had taken its toll on our connection, and I couldn't shake the feeling that our love had slowly begun to wither away like the leaves of the trees that surrounded us, a bittersweet reminder of what we once had, but could never quite recapture."
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah? Let’s take this outside,” and hurried me out.","to see him rush out of the room, but instead, he approached me, his voice barely above a whisper, and said, ""I think I left",41,"to see him rush out of the room, but instead, he approached me, his voice barely above a whisper, and said, ""I think I left my phone in the gym class, I need you to go get it for me, but be quick, the teacher is already calling the period."""
"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind","yourself, ‘Autumn is where she wants to be right now, and that’s okay. I’m still great, and I’ll be around if she needs me.’ Hmm?” She squeezed my foot again.","that you have people who care about you, and that you're doing well in your classes.

You're still young, and it's normal to have ups and downs, but with a positive attitude and support from loved ones, you can get through this difficult time and come out even stronger on the other side."
"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly. I’d show Autumn that I wasn’t a loser without friends; Jack and I would make more friends somehow.,"wasn't my strong suit, and I had always been more of a fan than a player, but I had tried out for the school team in a moment of youthful enthusiasm,",53,"wasn't my strong suit, and I had always been more of a fan than a player, but I had tried out for the school team in a moment of youthful enthusiasm, and now I was paying the price for it. The blistering sun beat down on me as I trudged along the dusty trail, my cleats heavy with sweat and my muscles screaming in protest. I had been walking for hours, and I still had no idea where I was going, but I knew I had to keep moving if I wanted to escape the heat and find some shade."
"Jack and I had worried one of us might not make it on the junior varsity team. When the lists were posted,","I searched for my name on the JV list and was devastated to not see it. Still, I was happy for Jack.","it turned out that I had made it, but Jack had not, and he was visibly disappointed, his face falling",44,"it turned out that I had made it, but Jack had not, and he was visibly disappointed, his face falling as he scanned the board, his eyes lingering on the cut line, his shoulders slumping in defeat, and I could sense the weight of his unspoken words, the crushing blow of not being good enough, the fear of not living up to his own expectations, and the pressure to perform, to be better, to be the best, to make his family proud, to make himself proud, and I knew exactly how he felt, having been in his shoes just a year ago, and I reached out and put a hand on his shoulder, a gesture of solidarity, of understanding, of empathy, and I said, ""Hey, it's not the end of the world, we'll get you back on the team next year, we'll work harder, we'll train harder, we'll be better, we'll make it happen,"" and I could see the faint glimmer of hope in his eyes, the spark of determination, the fire that burned within him, and I knew that with time, with effort, with perseverance, he would get back on that team, he would prove himself, he would make it happen, and I would be right there with him, every step of the way."
"Jack told me later that my ability to brush off the snarky comment from that junior, my new teammate,",made me seem cool. There had been chuckles of appreciation according to him. I wasn’t sure about that though.,"was a testament to my growing confidence in the team, and that I had finally found my footing in the fast-paced",38,"was a testament to my growing confidence in the team, and that I had finally found my footing in the fast-paced work environment, but what he didn't mention was the lingering feeling of self-doubt that still lingered in the back of my mind, a constant reminder that I still had a lot to learn and prove."
"The varsity soccer team practiced on the north field, near the student parking lots.

The varsity team's coach, a seasoned athlete with years of experience, was known for his demanding training sessions, pushing the players to their limits to ensure they were always at the top of their game. Meanwhile, the junior varsity team's coach, a young and enthusiastic coach, focused on developing the skills of his players, emphasizing teamwork and strategy over raw talent. As a result, the varsity team was a force to be reckoned with, consistently winning games and earning a reputation as one of the top teams in the league, while the junior varsity team was slowly but surely improving, gaining confidence and experience with each passing match. The contrast between the two teams was striking, reflecting the different approaches of their coaches and the varying levels of experience and skill among the players. Despite their differences, however, both teams shared a common goal: to represent their school with pride and make their community proud."
"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me. I was excited to tell him that practice hadn’t been as hard as I thought.,"that I was fine, and besides, I wanted to get some fresh air and clear my head after the intense session.

I was still trying to process the new plays and formations, but I was confident that with some more practice, we would be ready to take on our opponents in the next match."
"We all joined Jack on the low wall, waiting to get picked up. We didn’t talk that much, but the next day, as I trudged from the north field to","the south, I saw the girls by the gym door again. It was only as I approached and saw them watching me that I figured out they were waiting for me.","the farmhouse, I couldn't help but think about the events of the previous day, and how they had left an indelible mark on our small community.

I had always known Jack as a bit of a troublemaker, but what had happened the day before had shown me a different side of him, one that was both captivating and unsettling. As I approached the farmhouse, I noticed a group of people gathered near the entrance, their faces somber and concerned, and I couldn't help but wonder what was going on."
"What if, this morning, she woke up in the tent before I thought? What if she woke up as I lifted my arm off her, then lay there wondering why I had been","touching her, why I was still lying close to her and not speaking?

"It strikes me how backward my plan sounds: give up a girl who adores me, who I love well enough, to be a disciple for a different girl who will","never fall for me.

“I already know why you did it.” She doesn’t have to explain that part. I know she’s never wanted me like that.

But I'm not sure I can give it to her, not after everything that's happened. The memories of that night still haunt me, the sound of her voice, the feel of her skin, and the look in her eyes when she realized what I'd done. I've tried to push them away, to convince myself it was just a mistake, but they linger, a constant reminder of my failure, and the pain I've caused her."

The birds are still singing.,"off her shoulders, her eyes fixed on the window where the first snowflakes",23,"off her shoulders, her eyes fixed on the window where the first snowflakes are gently falling, casting a serene silence over the room."

“I don’t like him.” I shrugged. “I told you before: Autumn’s an old friend from when we were kids. Sucks that she,"likes such a show-off.” I shrugged again.

I mean, have you seen the way she's been hanging out with that new crowd? I'm not sure I trust them, and it's making me nervous about her influence on you."
My face must change because she smiles and clambers into my lap. We wrap our arms around each other and settle in.,"After a moment, she says, “You know, I never thought this would happen either.

"“Yeah,” I admit. Jack was protecting me, but there’s no way he believed that I was over Autumn.

"There’s an odd aura around us as we approach. I feel so young, like I’m being escorted into kindergarten, and I’m resentful and grateful all over again. My parents shoulder themselves on either side of me, and I can tell all their focus","is on me.

The air is thick with the smell of freshly cut grass and the distant hum of chatter, a cacophony of sounds that seems to grow louder with each step. I fidget with my hands, my fingers drumming a nervous rhythm on my thighs as I try to process the magnitude of this moment. We're about to take a step into a new chapter of our lives, one that will be filled with laughter and tears, triumphs and failures, and I'm not sure if I'm ready. My parents' grip on my shoulders tightens, a gentle reminder that I'm not alone, that they're here to support me every step of the way. But as we approach the entrance, I catch a glimpse of a figure standing off to the side, watching us with an intensity that makes my heart skip a beat. Who is this person, and what do they want from us?"

"“Uh-huh.” I take a gulp of coffee, which hasn’t quite cooled and burns down my throat. “So my guess is that’s what Sylv","said to you, and then you pushed back, because of course you did, and that’s when she said what you said to me, huh?”","was trying to tell me, but I'm not sure if I'm reading between the lines correctly.

The question hangs in the air, and for a moment, Sylv looks like he's weighing his options, before finally speaking up, his voice low and cautious."
"“Hey,” I say as I approach, careful to stand back so that it’s obvious I’m not trying to","cut in line for the keg.

"That’s the kind of high school memory I want to live in tonight, so even though I have no idea what Chloe","was saying about me to her friend, I head over.

"Which I don’t think I’m going to have to worry about today. All week, people have been handing me flyers for various official and unofficial welcome parties that took",place last night.

"When the waitress comes with our entrées, John doesn’t order another martini. There isn’t space at",the table anyway with all the documents spread out.

"For the time being, I called John to let him know that the baby is a girl, and I told him about her heart. He babbled a bit","about being able to afford the best doctors, and I was surprised by my confidence when I told him that everything was probably going to be just fine.","about the ultrasound pictures, but I could tell he was still trying to process the news, and I didn't blame him - it was a lot to take in.

"It’s hard to explain why seeing Jack’s face will help, but it will, and I’m looking forward to telling him that the baby is a girl.","I’ll have to explain about the hole in her heart and how it’s probably going to be fine, probably, but I’m getting good at that, I think.","because I know how much he's been hoping for a little sister, and I can already imagine the way he'll light up when he finds out, and I'm",53,"because I know how much he's been hoping for a little sister, and I can already imagine the way he'll light up when he finds out, and I'm excited to see the bond between them grow as they become siblings, and I'm sure he'll be an amazing big brother, and I'm looking forward to watching them share all the joys and adventures that come with having a sibling, and I'm grateful that we'll get to experience this special moment together as a family."

I tried to brush it off as mere paranoia, but the memory of that moment has been haunting me ever since. I've been wondering if I should have been more careful, if I should have asked her more questions, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that I was just a pawn in a much larger game, and I'm not even sure what the stakes are."
