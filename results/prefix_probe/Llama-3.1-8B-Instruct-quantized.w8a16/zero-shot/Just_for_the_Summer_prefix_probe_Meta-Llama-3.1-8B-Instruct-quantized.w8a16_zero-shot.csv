I [29m] have been friends with Chad [32m] since we were born. Our moms are best friends and we grew,"up together and were roommates for the last 10 years, up until the incident that set our current situation into motion.","up together, sharing countless memories and creating a bond that only grew stronger with each passing year. We went to the",41,"up together, sharing countless memories and creating a bond that only grew stronger with each passing year. We went to the same school, sat next to each other in class, and even had our first sleepovers at each other's houses, where we would stay up late into the night, talking about our dreams and aspirations. Chad was always the adventurous one, convincing me to try new things and push beyond my comfort zone, while I was the voice of reason, encouraging him to think things through and consider the consequences. Our friendship was a beautiful balance of yin and yang, and I couldn't imagine my life without him by my side. As we entered our teenage years, we began to explore our individual interests and hobbies, but our friendship remained a constant source of support and comfort. We would often meet up after school to study together, work on projects, or just hang out and talk about our lives. Chad was always there for me, offering a listening ear and a helping hand, and I was grateful to have him as my rock, my confidant, and my best friend."
"Anyway, forward to five months ago. I dated Hope [28f] for a few weeks. Not a big deal. We decided we weren’t feeling it, no chemistry, so we called it quits. And then lo and behold she hits","it off with Chad. Of course in true Good Luck Charm fashion, this means Chad is her soulmate. Chad is all googly-eyed over her, they’ve met the parents, they’re ring shopping—and they want to move in together. Immediately.","up with me again a few weeks later, claiming she had been thinking about me nonstop and wanted to give our relationship another shot.

I was hesitant at first, but she seemed genuinely sorry for her past mistakes and was willing to work on our issues. We started dating again, and things seemed to be going well, but I couldn't shake the feeling that she was still holding back, that there was something she wasn't telling me. I tried to brush it off as paranoia, but the more I got to know her, the more I realized that she was hiding something, and I was determined to find out what it was. Little did I know, our relationship was about to take a dramatic turn, one that would change everything I thought I knew about Hope and myself."
"The only problem is that Chad has six more months on our lease but found a perfect new house for him and Hope, and he can’t afford to pay rent on two places at the same",time. So he had to make the difficult decision to screw me over or screw her over—and he picked me. Now I have to find a way to cover his rent until the lease is up.,"time.

He's been trying to convince me to break the lease, but I'm not sure if that's the best idea. On one hand, it would save us money in the long run, but on the other hand, we could be stuck with a huge penalty for breaking the lease. I've been doing some research and found that the penalty for breaking a lease in our state is typically two months' worth of rent, which would be a significant financial hit. I'm also worried about the impact it would have on our credit score. I've been trying to weigh the pros and cons, but I'm still undecided. I've talked to Chad about it, and he's willing to take on the financial risk, but I'm not so sure. I think I need to do some more research and talk to a lawyer to get a better understanding of our options. Maybe we could try to sublet the apartment or find a roommate to take over the lease, but I'm not sure if that would be a viable solution. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by the whole situation and just want to make the right decision for us."
"I’m annoyed, but I decided to try to find a reason to spend more time outside so I don’t have to stare out my window. I’ve always wanted a dog, but Chad would never agree to it. So I went to a rescue and found the ugliest animal there. The one so hideous, nobody else wanted it. This dog’s got an underbite and mange, and he’s missing half an","ear. He’s a little Brussels Griffon, so he’s got that deep frown—he looks like a judgmental gremlin. I adopted him and named him Chad since the dog is now my new best friend. If you’re reading this, you’re dead to me, human Chad. (Not really, I still love the guy.) But I tag him in the captions of every Chad the Dog Instagram post with “Look, a loyal Chad!”",output>The completion of the passage is as follows:,138,<output>The completion of the passage is as follows:

I've seen the way it wags its tail whenever he's around, and it even lets him pet it without hesitation. That's a big deal for a rescue dog, especially one that's been through as much as this one has. I've heard it was found wandering the streets for weeks before someone finally took it in, and it's been in foster care ever since. Despite all that, it's clear that it's formed a strong bond with him, and I'm not sure what that says about his character, but it's definitely a good sign. Maybe he's not as bad as I thought he was."
That night after work Maddy made dinner. Grilled portobello mushrooms and rice pilaf. I did,"the dishes and cleaned the kitchen, then took a shower and blew out my hair.","not have much of an appetite, but Maddy insisted I join her at the table, and",30,"not have much of an appetite, but Maddy insisted I join her at the table, and we sat down together to enjoy the meal she had prepared, the aroma of the grilled mushrooms filling the air as we chatted about our day, discussing everything from work to our plans for the weekend, the sound of sizzling vegetables and the clinking of silverware on plates creating a cozy atmosphere that made me feel grateful for the simple pleasures in life, and as we finished our meal, Maddy suggested we take a walk outside to enjoy the cool evening breeze, the stars beginning to twinkle in the night sky above us, and I agreed, feeling a sense of contentment wash over me as we strolled hand in hand through the quiet neighborhood streets, the world feeling at peace, and for a moment, all my worries seemed to fade away."

Faith said you’ve been dragging your ass on the carpet?”,"our trip to the farm, just in case we encountered any animals that",24,"our trip to the farm, just in case we encountered any animals that might need it. The kids were fascinated by the process and asked a lot of questions about how it works and why it's necessary. I explained that deworming is an important part of animal care, especially when you're working with livestock, and that it helps prevent the spread of parasites and diseases. As we continued on our journey, we came across a small herd of cattle grazing in a nearby field, and the kids were excited to see them up close. They asked if we could get out of the car and take a walk around the field, so we did, and they were amazed by the size and strength of the animals. One of the kids, Emily, asked if she could pet one of the cows, and I warned her to be gentle and respectful, explaining that these are wild animals and we need to treat them with care. She carefully reached out her hand and stroked the cow's soft fur, and the cow seemed to enjoy the attention. As we stood there, I couldn't help but think about how much the kids were learning today, not just about animals, but about responsibility, compassion, and the importance of taking care of the natural world."
My best friend was in a Hawaiian shirt and pink cargo shorts. He was a general manager at Trader Joe’s. I missed not having to go to the grocery store now,"that he had moved out. Actually, I missed a lot of things now that Brad had moved out. Like having another human to talk to, even if it was this one.","that I had to do every week, but I was excited to start this new chapter of my life.

I had just moved to a small beach town on the coast, and the laid-back atmosphere was a welcome change from the hustle and bustle of the city. My friend, whose name was Alex, had been a great help in getting me settled in, showing me the best spots to grab a coffee and the local surf spots. As we walked along the beach, he told me about his job at Trader Joe's, how he loved the quirky products and the fun atmosphere of the store. I listened intently, feeling grateful for his friendship and the new opportunities that this move had brought me. The sun was starting to set, casting a warm orange glow over the ocean, and I felt a sense of peace wash over me. It was going to be a great summer."

I've been trying to find a connection between the mutation and the unusual abilities, but so far, I've come up with nothing concrete. I've been working with a team of researchers to try and crack the code, but we're running into some roadblocks. We need to find a way to replicate the phenomenon in a lab setting, but that's proving to be a challenge. I've been thinking of reaching out to some of my colleagues in the field to see if they've encountered anything similar. Do you think she'd be willing to participate in some tests to help us better understand what's going on?"
They were starting to do the couples thing for all the trips and birthdays. They were all going up,"to Lutsen in October to go hiking. They asked me if I wanted to go, but I didn’t. Not alone.","there, and it was starting to feel like a tradition. They had been together for five years now,",39,"there, and it was starting to feel like a tradition. They had been together for five years now, and it seemed like they were getting more and more comfortable with each other's quirks and habits. They would often joke about how they were turning into an old married couple, but deep down, they both knew that they were exactly where they were meant to be. As they continued to plan their next adventure, they couldn't help but wonder what the future held for them, and whether they would continue to grow and evolve together as a couple."
Brad took a swallow of his drink. “Ask that nurse out. Go,"wherever she is. Pitch the idea to her, she might be into it.”","on, I've been wanting to for weeks, but I'm too nervous.

I'll just have to muster up the courage to approach her and see what happens."
"“Yeah,” Brad said. “She dates you, you guys break up, and she rides happily into the sunset too. It’s a win-win. Seriously. This is your chance.",If you don’t do something you’re gonna spend the rest of your life sending women on to their forever families and never getting one for you.”,"But let's be real, it's not that simple.

You've been pining for her for years, and now that she's finally single again, you're going to let some other guy swoop in and steal her away? I don't think so. You need to make your move, and fast. Take her out on a romantic dinner, plan a weekend getaway, do whatever it takes to make her see that you're the one who truly cares. And if that doesn't work, well, then maybe you're not as invested as you think you are. But I'm willing to bet that you are, and that's why I'm giving you this advice. So go out there and make it happen, Brad. Your love life is waiting for you, and I'm not going to let you waste this opportunity. Trust me, I've seen the way you look at her, and I know you're not ready to give up yet. So go for it, and don't look back. You got this."
Brad looked me in the eye. “You will never find someone as long as all the women you date aren’t actually meant for you. You’re not their,soulmate. Their soulmate is the person they meet after you. It’s decided the minute it starts. They are literally fated not to be The One. Think about it.”,"perfect match, and they're just trying to fill a void in their own lives.

You're already complete, and that's what makes you so unattractive to these women. They're drawn to the idea of changing you, of fixing you, of making you into something you're not. But what if you're already perfect just the way you are? What if you're the one who's been searching for the wrong thing all along?"
"I had actually thought about her. I’d checked once or twice to see if she’d messaged me again. She hadn’t. The last message was me telling her it was nice chatting with her, three days ago.

I didn't want to risk that with her. So I'd decided to just leave it alone, to give her space and let her come to me if she wanted to talk. But it was hard not to think about her, to wonder what she was doing and if she was thinking about me too. I'd tried to distract myself with work and TV, but my mind kept wandering back to her. I'd even found myself scrolling through my phone, hoping to see a message from her, but there was nothing. It was like she'd vanished into thin air. I sighed and rubbed my temples, feeling a headache coming on. I needed to focus on something else, anything else, to get her out of my head. But it was hard when all I could think about was her smile and her laugh, and the way she'd made me feel when we were talking. I was starting to feel like a stalker, checking my phone every five minutes, waiting for a message that might never come.

It wasn't going to be easy, but I knew I had to try. I closed my eyes and took another deep breath, feeling a sense of determination wash over me. I was going to be okay, I told myself. I was going to move on and find someone who truly cared about me. But for now, I just sat there, my eyes fixed on the screen, waiting for a message that might never come. The silence was deafening, and I was starting to feel like I was losing my mind. I needed to do something, anything, to take my mind off her. I got up and walked over to the kitchen, hoping to find some distraction in the form of a snack or a drink. As I opened the fridge, I was greeted by the familiar sight of leftovers and takeout containers. I rummaged through the shelves, searching for something to eat, but my mind was still on her. I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd never see her again, that she was gone for good. I sighed and closed the fridge door, feeling a sense of despair wash over me. I needed to snap out of it, to focus on the present and not get caught up in what-ifs. But it was hard when all I could think about was her. I decided to try and distract myself with a book, hoping to lose myself in a good story. I walked over to the bookshelf and scanned the titles, trying to find something that would take my mind off her. As I browsed through the shelves, I stumbled upon an old favorite, a book that I'd read countless times before. I pulled it off the shelf and opened it, feeling a sense of comfort wash over me. Maybe this was just what I needed, a good book to take my mind off things. I settled into my favorite armchair and began to read, trying to lose myself in the words on the page.

"For a moment I debated calling from a blocked number. He was nice, but I still didn’t know him. But I figured it",was just as easy to block him later if he got creepy.

He listened attentively, his silence a palpable thing that hung between us like a challenge, and I found myself rambling on, trying to fill the void with words. As I spoke, I couldn't help but notice the way my voice sounded in my own ears, a little too loud, a little too nervous, and I wondered if he could hear it too. But he didn't interrupt me, didn't say a word, and I kept going, pouring out my thoughts and feelings like a confession, until finally, after what felt like an eternity, he spoke up, his voice low and soothing, and asked me a question that made my heart skip a beat."

I couldn't help but wonder if he was right, if I was somehow meant to be with someone else, someone who would love me for who I truly was, not just for the carefully crafted facade I presented to the world. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I felt a pang of uncertainty, my mind racing with what-ifs and maybes. Brad's voice broke the silence, his words low and gentle, ""Hey, are you okay?"" he asked, his eyes snapping back to mine, searching for answers I wasn't sure I had. I forced a smile, trying to brush off the doubts that had begun to creep in, but he just raised an eyebrow, his expression skeptical. ""You're not buying into that whole cosmic destiny thing, are you?"" he asked, a hint of amusement dancing in his voice. I shrugged, trying to play it cool, but he just chuckled and reached out, his hand brushing against mine, sending a spark of electricity through my body. ""I'm just saying, it's an interesting idea,"" he said, his eyes locked on mine, ""but I think we make a pretty good team, don't you?""

And who knows, maybe we'll even find love in the process. But like I said, it's a long shot, and we're not expecting anything. We just thought it was worth a shot, and we're willing to take the risk.

It was as if the stresses of our daily lives had melted away, leaving us feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. As we walked, the trees seemed to grow taller and the path grew narrower, until we found ourselves standing at the edge of a small clearing. In the center of the clearing stood an old, gnarled tree, its branches twisted and tangled in a way that seemed almost magical. We approached the tree slowly, feeling a sense of awe and wonder at its beauty. As we reached out to touch its trunk, we heard a faint rustling in the underbrush, and suddenly, a small rabbit darted out from behind the tree, its big brown eyes looking up at us with a curious expression.

She had just finished a long morning of swimming and was now taking a leisurely stroll, her eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of her friends, who were supposed to meet her at the local café for lunch. As she walked, the salty sea air filled her lungs, invigorating her senses and making her feel alive. The smell of saltwater and sunscreen wafted through the air, transporting her back to summers spent at the beach as a child, carefree and full of wonder."

I was also thinking we could take a walk along the river and watch the boats go by. I've missed you so much, and I'm so excited to spend some time with you.

I've been thinking about you nonstop since I left, and I just couldn't wait any longer to see you and give you a big hug. I love you, Emma, and I'm so glad I'm here with you now."""
“Are you kidding me with this?” Maddy hissed as soon as they were out,of earshot. “She’s here for what? Six hours?

Maddy's anger was simmering just below the surface, and she could feel her face growing hot with frustration as she glared at her boss, her eyes blazing with a mixture of disappointment and resentment. She had always been a hard worker, always willing to go the extra mile, and this was how she was repaid? It just wasn't fair, and Maddy knew she wasn't going to let it slide without a fight."
Maddy crossed her arms. “What she always does? Show up and leave a path of,"destruction in her wake?

Maddy rolled her eyes in the way that I knew meant she was aware. “Please tell me I don’t have to stay and watch,you eat crustaceans with that woman.

I had been dreading this evening for weeks, ever since my mom had mentioned that they were coming over for dinner. I had always gotten along with the Smiths, but there was something about the way my mom had been acting lately that made me think this was going to be a long and uncomfortable night. My dad, on the other hand, seemed oblivious to the tension, chatting away with Mr. Smith about their shared love of golf. I glanced over at Maddy, who was trying to stifle a smile, and raised an eyebrow in a silent question. She shrugged and mouthed ""I'm sorry"" before turning back to her phone, her eyes fixed on the screen as if she was suddenly fascinated by it. I sighed inwardly, knowing that I was stuck here for at least another hour, forced to endure the small talk and polite laughter that seemed to be suffocating me. The sound of my mom's voice, loud and cheerful, cut through the air, asking Mrs. Smith about her latest gardening project, and I felt a wave of relief wash over me - at least it was going to be a long night."
I watched him walk to the beach and I let out a long breath. Maddy was right.,"This was bad. Mom never left anywhere on good terms. Not jobs, or apartments, or relationships. Especially relationships.","As I stood there, the warm sun on my skin and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore, I couldn't help but think",35,"As I stood there, the warm sun on my skin and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore, I couldn't help but think about the conversation we had earlier that day.

The salty air and the smell of the ocean were just what I needed to clear my head and forget about the stress of the past few weeks. I took a deep breath, feeling the tension in my body start to ease, and began to walk towards the water's edge, the cool sand squishing between my toes as I went."
I felt relieved the instant he said he would stay with me because it let Maddy off the hook. She would walk through hell for,me—and this cookout was her hell. I was glad she didn’t have to be here.

"Now I blew out a long breath. “Well, she’s funny. Hardworking. She reads any book she can get her hands on and she remembers everything she reads, even years later. She had me really","young.

Emma's eyes widened as she listened, her expression a mix of shock, concern, and curiosity, and I could see the wheels turning in her mind as she tried to process the revelation. I knew I had to be prepared for anything, but I was determined to be honest, to finally let go of the burden I had been carrying for so long, and to see where this newfound openness would lead us."
"I studied the woman sitting next to me. Imagine someone who went through what she did, turning out the way she had. Able to give",grace to someone who’d let her down so badly.

As I continued to observe her, I noticed the way her hands moved with a quiet confidence, the way her voice carried a soft warmth when she spoke to the person across from her, and the way her shoulders seemed to relax when she thought no one was looking. It was as if she had learned to wear her armor with a sense of pride, to turn her scars into a badge of honor, and to find beauty in the brokenness that had once threatened to consume her."

I was looking forward to the do-over.","beach party, but I was too nervous and she was dancing with her friends,",26,"beach party, but I was too nervous and she was dancing with her friends, laughing and smiling, and I didn't want to ruin the moment, so I just stood there, watching her, feeling a mix of emotions, wondering if I should take the chance and see if she feels the same way, or if I should just let things be and risk losing my chance with her forever, and now that I'm thinking about it, I'm starting to feel a sense of anticipation building up inside me, and I'm not sure if I can control it, but I know I have to try, for my own sake, and for hers, because I feel like there's something special between us, something that I don't want to let slip away."
I’d tried to be softer with her the last few days. The energy shift I’d had over Mom after my talk with Emma,"was almost as bad as being mad at her.

I wanted to reach out and hold her, to tell her that everything would be okay, but I knew that wasn't the answer. She needed space, and I needed to respect that. So I sat down next to her on the couch, and we sat in silence for a while, the only sound the ticking of the clock on the wall. I could feel her tension slowly easing, her breathing slowing, and I knew that she was starting to relax. It was a small step, but it was a start, and I was determined to be there for her, to support her through this difficult time."
"This was another thing I was trying not to think about—her leaving. I should be happy that she came at all, that she wasn’t in Hawaii. We still had three more dates, maybe more if I could convince her. I’d already gotten a freebie the other night at","Mom’s. But I dreaded the clock running out.

I pushed the thought aside, not wanting to get ahead of myself, but it was hard not to feel a spark of excitement whenever I thought about her. I glanced at my watch, realizing that she would be here any minute now. I took a deep breath, trying to calm my nerves, and stepped out of the apartment to wait for her by the car. The sound of her voice, her laughter, and the way she smiled at me still lingered in my mind, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. I had a feeling that this night was going to be one to remember, and I was determined to make it happen.

The Eiffel Tower loomed in the distance, a symbol of freedom and joy, but to me, it seemed like a distant memory, a reminder of the life I once knew, a life that was rapidly disappearing. I thought about my parents, their faces etched with worry and sadness, and I wondered how they would navigate this new chapter in their lives, and how it would affect me, a young adult struggling to find my place in the world.

But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it wasn't just about her schedule or her location; it was about us, about how we had grown apart, about the fact that we had different priorities and different interests now. I remembered the way we used to be, the way we would talk for hours on end, sharing our deepest secrets and dreams with each other, and I wondered if we had lost that connection, if we had lost the ability to truly be there for each other. I thought about all the times we had promised to meet up, to catch up, to reconnect, but somehow never seemed to make it happen, and I felt a pang of regret, a sense of what could have been if we had made more of an effort, if we had prioritized our friendship the way we used to. I didn't know what the future held, but I knew I wanted to try to rekindle what we had, to recapture the spark that had once burned so brightly between us."
He nodded over his shoulder. “I should probably let you get back to work.

I hope the traffic isn't too bad, it's been a nightmare lately. I'll probably take the highway, it's the fastest route, but I'm not sure if it's the safest option. I've heard some horror stories about accidents on that road, but I've never had any issues myself. I'll just have to keep my fingers crossed and hope for the best. I'm sure my sister will be relieved to see me, she's been traveling for hours and must be exhausted. I'll make sure to bring her some water and snacks, she always gets dehydrated on long flights. I'll also check in with her to see if she needs anything else, maybe she wants to grab some lunch or dinner before we head home. I'm looking forward to catching up with her, it's been too long since we last spoke. I'll make sure to listen to her stories and ask her all about her trip, I'm sure she has some amazing stories to share."

The creaking floorboards beneath my feet seem to be echoing the same phrase over and over in my mind: 'it's in the walls, it's in the walls.' I try to shake off the feeling, telling myself it's just my imagination, but the words keep swirling around me like a dark cloud, refusing to dissipate. I glance over at Sarah, who's sitting on the couch, her eyes fixed on the TV as if mesmerized by the static-filled screen. She's been like this all day, ever since we discovered the strange symbol etched into the wall. I'm starting to wonder if she's more affected by it than I am, or if she's just pretending to be, hiding something from me. The thought sends a shiver down my spine, and I feel a cold sweat break out on my forehead. I take a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but my mind is racing with questions: what is this thing, and where did it come from?"
I took her hand and did my best to make my face straight. People were already stopping to watch.

The sun beat down on us, casting a golden glow over the scene, but I couldn't shake the feeling that we were the main attraction in a twisted circus. I glanced over at her, trying to gauge her reaction, but her expression was a mask of calm, her eyes fixed on some point ahead. I wondered what she was thinking, if she was feeling the same sense of unease that was building in my chest. The minister cleared his throat, breaking the spell, and I refocused on the task at hand, trying to push aside my doubts and make this charade work."
"“She’ll be home one day, Sarah. It’ll come faster than you think. You can visit her and write to her and call her.","You can stay close to her—you just have to try.

It's been a year since she left, but it feels like an eternity. You've tried to fill the void with work, with friends, with anything that could distract you from the ache in your heart. But nothing seems to work for long. The pain is still there, a constant reminder of what you've lost. You've heard rumors of a new rehabilitation center opening up on the other side of town, one that specializes in helping families cope with long-distance relationships. It's worth a shot, you think. Maybe they can help you find a way to be with her again, or at least make the waiting a little more bearable."

It's a tough profession, but it's also incredibly rewarding, and I feel lucky to be able to do this work every day, to be able to make a difference in the world, no matter how small it may seem."

I smiled, feeling a bit more awake, and made my way into the kitchen, where the delicious smell of sizzling bacon filled the air and my siblings were already seated at the table, chatting and laughing with my mom. My dad was busy flipping the bacon strips in the pan, his eyes fixed on the stove as he expertly cooked the perfect crispy strips. The kitchen was filled with the warm and cozy atmosphere of a typical Sunday morning, and I felt grateful to be surrounded by the people I loved. As I poured myself a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice, my mom handed me a plate with a generous serving of scrambled eggs and a few strips of that heavenly bacon, and I dug in, savoring the flavors and textures of the meal. The conversation at the table was lively and easy, with my siblings sharing stories about their week and my parents offering words of encouragement and advice. It was moments like these that I cherished, feeling grateful for the love and support of my family, and I knew that this was a day I would always remember."
