I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that,"we were crashing at my house, and I felt it was my duty to be the one to take the blows.","he was getting too close to her, and I couldn't let that happen, not after everything we've",41,"he was getting too close to her, and I couldn't let that happen, not after everything we've been through. I've been watching them for weeks now, studying their interactions, and I'm convinced that Autumn is the key to unlocking the secrets of the mysterious disappearance of Jack's sister. I've seen the way he looks at her, the way he talks to her, and I know he's hiding something. I've been trying to get closer to Autumn, to get her to open up to me, but she's been elusive, always staying one step ahead. I've tried to dig up dirt on her, to find out what she's hiding, but so far, nothing has panned out. I'm starting to get desperate, and I know I need to tread carefully, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up. The more I learn about Autumn, the more I realize that she's not what she seems, and I'm starting to wonder if I've made a huge mistake by getting involved in this. But I'm not one to back down from a challenge, and I'm determined to uncover the truth, no matter what it takes."
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.","Emily, who had been hesitant at first, ended up enjoying the thrilling experience, and as we walked out of the cinema, they both agreed",49,"Emily, who had been hesitant at first, ended up enjoying the thrilling experience, and as we walked out of the cinema, they both agreed that it was one of the most entertaining films they had seen in a long time. However, the real excitement was yet to come, as they stumbled upon an old, mysterious-looking mansion on the outskirts of town, which seemed to be the perfect setting for their next adventure. The mansion, with its tall, dark spires and overgrown gardens, seemed to whisper secrets to them, drawing them in with an otherworldly allure. As they stood before the entrance, a chill ran down their spines, and they exchanged a nervous glance, wondering what lay ahead, but also feeling an inexplicable sense of curiosity and trepidation."
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.",The dim light in the room casts an eerie glow on the walls as I wait for the sound of the,36,"The dim light in the room casts an eerie glow on the walls as I wait for the sound of the door closing, my heart racing with anticipation, the soft rustling of the blankets a stark contrast to the turmoil brewing inside me, the air thick with unspoken tension, and the silence a heavy weight that presses down on my chest, making it hard to breathe, the seconds ticking by like hours, each one a countdown to the unknown, and I can feel Jack's eyes on me, his presence a palpable force that makes my skin prickle with goosebumps, the anticipation building to a crescendo, and I wonder what he will do next, will he speak, will he touch me, or will he just stand there, frozen in time, his silence a deafening scream that echoes through my mind, and I strain to hear the slightest sound, my ears perked up like a rabbit on high alert, my senses on overdrive, and I feel like I'm trapped in a never-ending nightmare, unable to wake up, unable to escape, unable to move, unable to breathe, and the darkness closes in around me like a shroud, suffocating me, and I'm not sure if I'll ever find my way out, or if I'll be stuck in this purgatory forever, lost in a sea of uncertainty, with no lifeline to cling to, no anchor to hold onto, no safe haven to retreat to, and the thought sends a shiver down my spine, making me tremble with fear, and I wonder if I've made a terrible mistake, if I've stepped into a world that's beyond my control, a world that's beyond my understanding, a world that's beyond my comprehension, and I'm not sure if I'll ever find my way back to reality, or if I'll be forever lost in this labyrinth of uncertainty, with no escape in sight, no respite from the torment, no peace to be found, and the thought sends a wave of despair washing over me, threatening to consume me whole, and I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to find my way out of this darkness, or if I'll be forever trapped in this living hell, with no hope of redemption, no chance of forgiveness, and no escape from the torment that's been unleashed upon me."
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,"speaking in hushed tones, his eyes darting nervously toward the trees surrounding our campsite, as if he's worried",41,"speaking in hushed tones, his eyes darting nervously toward the trees surrounding our campsite, as if he's worried we're being watched. I follow his gaze, but all I see are the swaying branches of the willows and the occasional flash of a bird taking flight. ""I'm just gathering some firewood,"" I reply, trying to sound nonchalant, though my heart is racing with a mix of fear and confusion. Jack's expression is skeptical, and I can tell he doesn't believe me. He takes a step closer, his eyes locked on mine, and I can feel the tension between us building. ""You're not telling me the truth, are you?"" he asks, his voice barely above a whisper. I hesitate, unsure of how much to reveal, but something about his concerned expression makes me open up, and I find myself pouring out the entire story, from the strange occurrences in the woods to the feeling of being watched, and the eerie sensation that we're not alone in this place."
"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with","the word “type.” Autumn makes a noise in the tent, and we both hold our breaths and listen.","something about needing a coffee, and I nod in agreement, knowing that a caffeine boost is just",35,"...something about needing a coffee, and I nod in agreement, knowing that a caffeine boost is just what he needs to tackle the long day ahead of us. We head to the kitchen to start the coffee maker, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee filling the air as we wait for it to finish. The silence between us is comfortable, a familiar silence that comes from years of working together. I glance over at Jack, his eyes still fixed on the floor, his expression a mix of frustration and exhaustion. I can tell he's still thinking about the project we're working on, the one that's been giving him trouble for weeks. I decide to break the silence, asking him about the latest developments, and he looks up, a hint of a smile on his face as he begins to explain."
"“Zoned out the way she does? You have been so, so…","Like last week!” Jack asks, “How could you have missed that game?”","distracted lately, I've noticed. It's like you're a million miles away,",23,"...distracted lately, I've noticed. It's like you're a million miles away, lost in thought, and nothing seems to bring you back to reality. Even when we're together, I feel like I'm talking to a ghost, and it's really starting to worry me. I've tried to talk to you about it, but you just brush it off and say you're fine, that everything's okay. But I know that's not true. You're not fine, and I'm starting to think that something's really wrong."
“Why don’t we restart the movie? We can all watch it.” Jack,gives me a look to remind me that our other conversation isn’t over.,"The others looked at him uncertainly, but Sarah spoke up, ""I don't know,",25,"The others looked at him uncertainly, but Sarah spoke up, ""I don't know, Jack, we've already seen it three times, and I'm not sure I can sit through it again, but I suppose it's better than playing charades."" The group fell silent, weighing their options, with some nodding in agreement and others looking unenthused, as they considered the prospect of reliving the cheesy 80s rom-com for the fourth time that weekend."
"I walk Jack to his car, and when he turns to me with that","look on his face, I know what he’s going to say. I open my mouth.","smile, I'm taken aback by the genuine warmth in his eyes, a stark",29,"smile, I'm taken aback by the genuine warmth in his eyes, a stark contrast to the usual stoic expression he wears, and for a moment, I'm caught off guard, unsure of how to respond to the sudden display of vulnerability."
"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke. Surely the school administrators knew we had always been together, were meant to be together. Surely, if I looked around the cafeteria, she would be there?","together was a different story.

We would often sit at the same table in the cafeteria, and I would catch glimpses of him laughing with his friends or staring off into space, his eyes lost in thought. I found myself wondering what made him so introspective, and whether he was as lost in his own world as he seemed. As the days went by, I found myself looking forward to lunchtime, not just for the food, but for the chance to see Jack and try to decipher the mystery that was him. Little did I know, our lives were about to become intertwined in ways I never could have imagined."
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time. I didn’t sit down because I recognized Jack though; I simply sat at the first empty seat, defeated. But Jack remembered me. He asked me if I ever watched pro soccer. I said yeah, not really interested in conversation, not really listening, wondering what Autumn was doing.","dismissed us early, and I had been looking forward to this break all day.

We had been friends since freshman year, and it was easy to fall into our usual banter. ""Hey, man, I'm starving,"" Jack said, gesturing to the menu on the table. ""I'm thinking about getting a burger and fries. You in?"" I scanned the menu, my stomach growling in agreement. We had just enough time to grab a quick bite before our next class, and I was down for whatever. As we ordered and waited for our food to arrive, Jack started telling me about his plans for the upcoming weekend. He was heading to his grandparents' house for a family barbecue, and he was excited to show off his new skateboard tricks. I listened intently, asking the occasional question and making supportive noises, but my mind started to wander. I had a project due soon, and I still needed to finish researching and outlining it. I made a mental note to ask Jack if he had any suggestions for sources, but for now, I just smiled and nodded along, enjoying the easy conversation and the warmth of the sun on my face through the window."
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.","his voice was a little shaky, and Autumn's smile faltered for a moment before she regained her composure.

She walked towards him, her long, curly brown hair bouncing with each step, and her bright blue eyes sparkling with a mix of curiosity and caution. Jack's eyes widened as he took in the sight of her, his mind racing with questions and emotions. He had expected a friend, but this was someone entirely different. Autumn's new appearance was a shock, and he wasn't sure how to process it. He stood there, frozen, as she approached him, her smile growing wider as she reached out to greet him. ""It's been a while,"" she said, her voice warm and friendly, but with a hint of nervousness. Jack nodded, still trying to wrap his head around the situation, and Autumn's eyes sparkled with amusement as she took in his reaction. She had expected him to be surprised, but not this surprised. She had been worried about how he would react, and now that she saw the look on his face, she wasn't sure if she had made a mistake by coming here. Jack's eyes finally snapped back into focus, and he took a step forward, his voice barely above a whisper as he asked, ""Autumn, what's going on?"" The words hung in the air, and Autumn's smile faltered again, this time with a hint of sadness. She took a deep breath, and began to explain, her voice barely above a whisper as well, ""I've been gone for a while, Jack. I've been through a lot, and I've changed. I'm not the same person you knew."" Jack's eyes widened again, and he felt a pang of confusion and concern. He didn't know what to say, or how to react. He just stood there, frozen, as Autumn continued to explain, her words spilling out in a rush as she tried to make sense of everything that had happened to her."
"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face. He didn’t believe that Autumn was—or ever had been—my friend. The daughter of my mom’s best friend, who was around a lot? Sure.

"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.","adorned the walls, and the scent of pumpkin spice wafted through the air, enticing him to join me in the festivities.

I baked pies, made candles, and even crafted a wreath for the front door, all in an attempt to create a cozy atmosphere that would make him feel welcome. As the days went by, Jack began to notice the changes and would often comment on how much he enjoyed the autumnal decorations. I took this as a sign that my mission was working, and I continued to push the boundaries of my creativity, determined to show Jack that Autumn was indeed my friend. I started a small garden in my backyard, where I planted a variety of seasonal flowers and vegetables, and even set up a small bonfire pit where we could roast marshmallows and tell ghost stories on chilly evenings. The more I immersed myself in the spirit of Autumn, the more I felt a sense of belonging and connection to the season, and I was convinced that Jack was starting to feel the same way."
"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still","friends. On the last day of school before winter break, Jack finally said something. I cannot remember what I had been telling him, only that it had been about Autumn.","in a relationship, as the distance and time apart had taken a toll on our connection, and I couldn't shake the feeling that our friendship had slowly but surely transformed",59,"still in a relationship, as the distance and time apart had taken a toll on our connection, and I couldn't shake the feeling that our friendship had slowly but surely transformed into something more platonic, a notion that Autumn seemed to agree with, her smile and laughter now tinged with a hint of nostalgia as we reminisced about old times, and I couldn't help but wonder if I had been foolish to hold onto the hope that our bond could be rekindled, or if it was simply a lingering attachment to a chapter of my life that had long since closed, leaving me to ponder the what-ifs and maybes that had become all too familiar in the silence that now hung between us."
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah? Let’s take this outside,” and hurried me out.","to see a typical pre-game jitters expression, but instead, he seemed genuinely scared.

I followed his gaze, trying to understand what was causing his distress, but everything seemed normal – the usual chatter, the sound of water splashing in the showers, and the smell of sweat and deodorant hanging in the air. The coach's voice echoed through the speakers, reminding us that it was time to get back on the ice, but Jack didn't move. He just stood there, frozen in place, his eyes fixed on something that only he could see."
"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind","yourself, ‘Autumn is where she wants to be right now, and that’s okay. I’m still great, and I’ll be around if she needs me.’ Hmm?” She squeezed my foot again.","yourself of all the things you're good at and the people who care about you.

Just remember to be kind to yourself and take things one step at a time. You got this!"
"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly. I’d show Autumn that I wasn’t a loser without friends; Jack and I would make more friends somehow.,"wasn't really my thing, but I had always been fascinated by the way the players moved in perfect sync, their feet barely touching the ground as they",53,"wasn't really my thing, but I had always been fascinated by the way the players moved in perfect sync, their feet barely touching the ground as they sprinted down the field. I had tried out for the school team a few years ago, but I was terrible at it, and my lack of coordination made me more of a liability than an asset. Still, I loved watching the games, and I often found myself lost in the rhythm of the game, the sound of the ball hitting the ground, the cheers of the crowd, and the smell of freshly cut grass. It was exhilarating, and I couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy whenever I saw the players' confidence and skill on the field. I knew I needed to find a way to channel that same energy and passion into something I was good at, something that would make me feel just as alive."
"Jack and I had worried one of us might not make it on the junior varsity team. When the lists were posted,","I searched for my name on the JV list and was devastated to not see it.

"Jack told me later that my ability to brush off the snarky comment from that junior, my new teammate,",made me seem cool. There had been chuckles of appreciation according to him. I wasn’t sure about that though.,"made him realize that I was not someone to be trifled with, and it actually earned me some respect from the rest",38,"made him realize that I was not someone to be trifled with, and it actually earned me some respect from the rest of the team, who had been watching our exchange with great interest.

As we continued to collaborate on the project, I found that my ability to handle difficult situations with ease had a positive impact on the team's dynamics, and we were able to produce some outstanding results, which ultimately led to our team winning the competition. Jack and I even became close friends, and I was grateful for the opportunity to have worked with him, learning a great deal from his experience and expertise. Our collaboration was a great example of how a positive attitude and effective communication can lead to success, even in the most challenging of situations."

The varsity team's coach, a seasoned athlete with years of experience, reviewed the game plan with the team, emphasizing the importance of teamwork and communication. Meanwhile, the junior varsity team's coach, a young and energetic leader, focused on perfecting their passing drills, encouraging the players to work together seamlessly. As the practice came to a close, the teams gathered their gear and headed off the fields, already looking forward to the next day's session. The sound of laughter and chatter filled the air as the players made their way back to the locker rooms, exhausted but exhilarated from a productive practice. The coaches, too, were pleased with the progress their teams had made, and they couldn't wait to see how they would perform in the upcoming matches."
"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me.

The sound of crickets and the distant hum of a lawnmower filled the air as I walked, a soothing background noise that seemed to match the rhythm of my footsteps. I felt at peace, lost in thought, as I made my way home under the starry night sky."
"We all joined Jack on the low wall, waiting to get picked up. We didn’t talk that much, but the next day, as I trudged from the north field to","the south, I saw the girls by the gym door again.

They seemed just as concerned as I was, and we all agreed to search for him together. We combed the fields and the woods, calling out his name, but there was no response. As the sun began to set, we reluctantly headed back to the farmhouse, still worried about Jack's disappearance. We all went to bed that night, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, and I lay awake for a long time, thinking about Jack and wondering where he could be."
"What if, this morning, she woke up in the tent before I thought?

But as the light grew stronger, her expression changed, and she looked at me with a mixture of confusion and fear, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar surroundings as if trying to piece together the fragments of a dream. I knew then that she had no memory of the night before, and a pang of guilt hit me like a cold wind, leaving me wondering how I could have let things go so far without her consent, and what the consequences of my actions might be."
"It strikes me how backward my plan sounds: give up a girl who adores me, who I love well enough, to be a disciple for a different girl who will","never fall for me. Jack has always said I’m irrational when it comes to Autumn, and maybe I should have taken him more seriously, because he was right earlier today.","never truly love me, and instead settle for a life of servitude and devotion to a cause that may not even be just.

“I already know why you did it.” She doesn’t have to explain that part. I know she’s never wanted me like that.

There's something about her that still feels familiar, but also a little off.

But my dad senses that something is bothering me and presses me for more information, so I take a deep breath and start to explain what happened with Alex and how it's been affecting me lately. My parents listen attentively, their expressions growing more serious with each passing moment, and I can tell they're trying to process everything I'm telling them. They ask me questions and offer words of encouragement, and for the first time in a long time, I feel like I can finally open up and be honest about how I'm feeling. As we talk, I start to feel a weight lifting off my shoulders, and I realize that maybe, just maybe, I'm not alone in all of this after all."

He had spent countless hours strumming its strings, pouring his heart out in the form of melodies that seemed to capture the essence of his youth. The photograph had been taken during a particularly vibrant period in his life, one that he often found himself reminiscing about when the pressures of adulthood began to weigh him down. As he gazed at the picture, Brett couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia wash over him, a longing for the simplicity and freedom of his younger years."

His friends from those days still try to get him to join their gaming marathons, but Brett has become increasingly selective about how he spends his free time, often opting for activities that allow him to be more creative and outdoorsy. In fact, I've seen him bring his easel and paints to the campus art studio, where he works on his latest masterpieces, and he's even started selling some of his artwork online, which is quite impressive. His newfound passion for art has also inspired some of his friends to explore their own creative sides, and now the campus is filled with more vibrant murals and street art than ever before, which is a testament to Brett's influence and the positive impact he's had on the community. Despite his growth and changes, however, some people still remember him as the guy who used to spend hours on end playing the same video game, and it's interesting to see how people's perceptions of him have shifted over time."

"The waitress appears with our salads. Mine is seaweed and shavings of cucumber, which looks like a pile of green spaghetti. John’s salad is red somehow. I find myself ordering both steak and lobster and wondering if the waitress will","faint if I ask for a doggy bag at the end of the meal.

The aroma of sizzling meat wafts from the kitchen, making my stomach growl with anticipation. John, on the other hand, seems unimpressed, his eyes fixed on his phone as he scrolls through his social media feed. I try to engage him in conversation, asking about his day, but he's too engrossed in his screen to respond. The waitress returns to take our order for the main course, and I find myself hesitating between the two options, unsure of which one to choose. The waitress notices my indecision and offers her recommendation, suggesting that the steak is cooked to perfection and the lobster is incredibly fresh. I ask her to surprise me, and she smiles, nodding in understanding. As she walks away, I turn to John and ask him if he's ready to order, but he's still distracted, his eyes fixed on the screen. I sigh inwardly, wondering if I'll ever be able to get his attention. The restaurant is starting to fill up, and the noise level is increasing, making it difficult to concentrate. I take a sip of my water, trying to calm my nerves and focus on the task at hand. The waitress returns with our main courses, and I'm surprised to see that she's brought me both the steak and the lobster, just as I had requested. John looks up from his phone, a hint of a smile on his face, and I realize that he must have ordered the same thing. We spend the next hour savoring our food, enjoying the quiet moment of companionship, and trying to make the most of our evening out."

I also want to know more about the mysterious stranger who's been seen lurking around town, and if anyone's noticed anything unusual happening at the abandoned mill on the outskirts of town. I make a mental note to ask around and see if anyone's heard anything. The sun is setting, casting a golden glow over the small town, and I can feel a sense of unease in the air. It's as if everyone's waiting for something to happen, but no one knows what. I take a deep breath and head back to the office, determined to get to the bottom of things."

The restaurant is bustling with the sounds of laughter and clinking glasses, creating a lively atmosphere that's perfect for a night out with friends."
"For the time being, I called John to let him know that the baby is a girl, and I told him about her heart. He babbled a bit","about being able to afford the best doctors, and I was surprised by my confidence when I told him that everything was probably going to be just fine.","about the upcoming surgery and how it would affect our plans for the family vacation, but I could tell he was trying to be strong for me.

I appreciated that, but I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions myself - excitement for our little girl's arrival, worry about her health, and uncertainty about what the future held. I tried to reassure John that everything would be okay, that the doctors were the best and that we would get through this together, but deep down, I was scared. I didn't want to burden him with my fears, so I just smiled and told him that we would talk more about it later. As we hung up the phone, I couldn't shake off the feeling that our lives were about to change in ways we couldn't even imagine."
"It’s hard to explain why seeing Jack’s face will help, but it will, and I’m looking forward to telling him that the baby is a girl.","I’ll have to explain about the hole in her heart and how it’s probably going to be fine, probably, but I’m getting good at that, I think.","It's a feeling that's hard to put into words, but I'm hoping that seeing the look of joy on his face when he finds out the baby is a girl",53,"It's a feeling that's hard to put into words, but I'm hoping that seeing the look of joy on his face when he finds out the baby is a girl will be a moment I'll always treasure, and I'm excited to capture that moment and share it with him, to see the way his eyes light up and the huge smile that will spread across his face, and to hear the words of excitement and love that will come out of his mouth as he holds our little girl in his arms for the first time."

"“Well, I had this umbrella of hers, and when I went to return it, something happened,” Jack said. “I think it’s going","to keep happening too.

I was walking down the street, and I saw her standing in front of the coffee shop, laughing with a group of friends. She was wearing the same yellow sundress she had on the day we met, and for a moment, I felt like I was transported back in time. I must have looked like a total idiot standing there, staring at her, because she caught my eye and smiled. I quickly looked away, feeling a mix of emotions: guilt, nostalgia, and a hint of regret. I took a deep breath and continued walking, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that our lives had intersected again for a reason. As I walked further, I noticed a piece of paper on the ground, and to my surprise, it was a note with my name on it. I picked it up, and my heart skipped a beat when I read the message: ""Meet me at the old oak tree at 5 pm. Come alone."" It was her handwriting, and I knew I had to go."
