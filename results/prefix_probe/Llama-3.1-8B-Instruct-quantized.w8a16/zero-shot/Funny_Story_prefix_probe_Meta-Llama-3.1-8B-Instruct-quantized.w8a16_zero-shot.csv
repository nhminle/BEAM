She's always the life of the party, with a smile that can light up a room and a laugh that's infectious.

Her friends adore her for her spontaneity and her willingness to take risks, and her beauty is only matched by her kind heart. Despite my own aversion to beer, I have to admit that Petra's enthusiasm is contagious, and I often find myself getting drawn into her world, if only for a little while."

And now, as I stand here, surrounded by the memories of a life I never truly lived, I'm starting to understand that I was just a stranger in a strange land, a nomad without a home to call my own. The sweatshirt, which had once been a symbol of comfort and security, now feels like a reminder of the impermanence of everything, a fleeting sense of belonging that can be taken away at any moment. I look at him, and for a moment, our eyes lock, and I see a glimmer of understanding in his gaze, a sense that he too knows what it's like to be a wanderer, a traveler without a destination, a soul adrift in a world that's constantly in motion."

I wanted her to know that I was the home she had been trying to find, the safe haven where she could be herself, the place where she could be free. I wanted her to feel the connection between us, the spark that ignited when we touched, the flame that burned brighter with every passing day. I wanted her to know that I was the one who could make her happy, who could make her laugh, who could make her feel alive. I wanted her to see that I was the one who could be her rock, her shelter, her guiding light in the darkest of times.

"“And there’s this girl Maya, who comes in once a week. Twelve or thirteen. Perfect little weirdo. She reads everything—goes through like five books a week.

She’s got this little notebook where she writes down all the titles and authors, and then she makes these intricate little doodles in the margins. It’s really something to see. Sometimes she’ll come in and just sit at the table for hours, nose buried in a book, completely absorbed. I love watching her like that. She reminds me of myself when I was younger, always getting lost in stories. I try to pick books that will challenge her, but also make her feel like she’s not alone in the world. Last week, I gave her a copy of ‘The Giver’ by Lois Lowry, and she devoured it in one sitting. We had a great discussion about it afterwards, and I could see the wheels turning in her head as she tried to process the themes and ideas. It’s moments like those that make me feel like I’m doing something right, you know? Like I’m making a difference in this kid’s life, even if it’s just in a small way. And it’s not just Maya, either – we get all sorts of kids coming in here, each with their own unique story and struggles. There’s this one boy, Alex, who’s been through some tough times, and he’s always looking for something to take his mind off things. I try to find him books that are a little more lighthearted, something to make him smile. And then there’s Emma, who’s just a total bookworm – she’s always asking for recommendations and devouring them in a matter of days. It’s amazing to see how much of an impact a good book can have on someone’s life. I feel so lucky to be a part of it all, to be able to share my love of reading with these kids and watch them grow and learn. It’s a privilege, really, and I don’t take it lightly. I know that not every kid has access to a place like this, where they can just come and be themselves, surrounded by books and people who care. So I try to make the most of it, to create a space that feels welcoming and inclusive. And it’s not just about the books, either – it’s about the people, the community that forms here. We have our disagreements and our differences, but at the end of the day, we’re all just a bunch of book lovers trying to make a difference in the world, one page at a time."

I'll just have to be prepared for the worst-case scenario, where she ignores me or worse, tries to make me look even more foolish.

I've also been considering the fact that skirts can be a great way to express my personal style and add some variety to my wardrobe, and I've been looking at different styles and fabrics to see what I like best. I've even been thinking about pairing a skirt with a pair of boots or sneakers to give it a more edgy look, and I've been looking at different ways to accessorize with scarves, hats, and jewelry to add some personality to my outfit.
