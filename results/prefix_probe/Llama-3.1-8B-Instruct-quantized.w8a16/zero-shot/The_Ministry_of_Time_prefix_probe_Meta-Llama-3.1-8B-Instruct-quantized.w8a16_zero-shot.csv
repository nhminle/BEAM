"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking. Lacerations too, from a Taser—he’d shot at two of the team members who’d come to expatriate him, and a third was forced to fire.","their bodies had been returned to the early 19th century, leaving the remaining five to navigate this bewildering new world.

The hospital, a sterile and futuristic facility, had been a blur of beeping machines and sterile smells, but the doctors and nurses had been kind and attentive, helping him to adjust to his new surroundings. As he sat in the common room, sipping a cup of coffee and staring out the window at the towering skyscrapers, Graham couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and trepidation. He had been a naval commander in his own time, but this was a world beyond anything he could have imagined. The people, the technology, the sheer scale of it all was overwhelming, and he couldn't shake the feeling that he was just a relic from another era, a stranger in a strange land. The other expats, a mix of soldiers, politicians, and scientists, seemed to be adjusting better than he was, but then again, they had all been lucid for longer. There was Emily, the young woman who had been a nurse in the Crimean War, now working as a nurse in this hospital, and James, the former prime minister, who was trying to make sense of the complex politics of this new world. Graham, on the other hand, was still trying to wrap his head around the basics of modern life. He had learned to use a smartphone, but only just, and the concept of money and credit cards was still a mystery to him. As he sat there, feeling lost and alone, he heard a voice behind him. ""Graham, how are you doing?"" It was Emily, a concerned look on her face. ""I'm doing all right, I suppose,"" he replied, trying to sound more confident than he felt. ""I just can't seem to get used to all of this,"" he added, gesturing to the city outside the window. Emily nodded sympathetically. ""It takes time,"" she said. ""But you'll get there. We all do."" She smiled and sat down beside him, and for a moment, Graham felt a sense of comfort and belonging. But as he looked out the window, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was just a ghost from another time, a reminder of a world that was long gone. The city seemed to stretch on forever, a never-ending expanse of steel and concrete, and Graham felt small and insignificant in the face of it all. He wondered if he would ever truly belong in this strange new world, or if he would always be a stranger, looking in from the outside. The thought sent a shiver down his spine, and he turned back to Emily, hoping to find some reassurance in her kind eyes. But as he looked at her, he saw something there that made his heart skip a beat. It was a look of concern, but also something more. A look of curiosity, of fascination. And Graham realized, with a start, that Emily was not just a nurse, but a historian. And she was looking at him with the eyes of a woman who had seen something in him that no one else had. Something that made her wonder if he was more than just a relic from the past. Something that made her wonder if he was a key to unlocking the secrets of the past. And Graham, sensing this, felt a spark of hope ignite within him. Maybe, just maybe, he was not just a stranger in a strange land. Maybe he was something more. Maybe he was a doorway to a new world, a world of possibilities and discovery. And with that thought, Graham felt a sense of purpose that he had not felt in weeks. He was no longer just a relic from the past. He was a man with a mission. And he was ready to take on whatever the future held. "

The once-vibrant paint had chipped away, revealing the rough brick beneath, and the intricate moldings were worn smooth by the touch of countless hands. Despite its age, the house still exuded a sense of character, its high ceilings and large windows a testament to the lives of the workers who had once called it home. As I stepped inside, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me, as if the very walls were whispering stories of the past. The air was thick with the scent of old books and dust, and I could almost hear the sound of laughter and conversation, echoing through the empty halls. It was as if the house was waiting for its occupants to return, to bring it back to life and fill its rooms with the warmth and love that had once been there. I wandered from room to room, taking in the details that had been left behind - the old clock on the mantle, the faded photographs on the walls, the worn armchairs that seemed to sag under the weight of years. Each step felt like a journey through time, a glimpse into the lives of the people who had lived and loved within these walls. And yet, despite the sense of history that permeated every corner of the house, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched, that unblinking eyes were trained on me from the shadows. I tried to brush it off as mere imagination, but the feeling only grew stronger as I explored further, until I stumbled upon a door that seemed out of place among the others. It was hidden behind a tattered tapestry, and it looked as though it hadn't been opened in years. I hesitated for a moment, wondering if I should investigate further, but my curiosity got the better of me, and I slowly turned the handle and pushed the door open."

His eyes wandered to the clock on the wall, the ticking sound echoing through the silence, a reminder that time was running out. He took a long drag from his cigarette, the smoke curling upwards as he exhaled slowly, his thoughts still a thousand miles away. The sound of the water dripping from the faucet was the only other noise in the room, a steady beat that seemed to match the rhythm of his racing heart. He stood up, his movements fluid and deliberate, and began to walk towards the door, the sound of his footsteps echoing off the tiles, a stark contrast to the quiet of the bathroom. As he reached for the door handle, he hesitated for a moment, his hand hovering over the cool metal, his mind still grappling with the weight of his responsibilities, the weight of the world outside these four walls."
"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale. A vile smell was seeping up from the floor.","pipes were frozen, and the sound of dripping water echoed through the abandoned corridors of the old research",39,"The pipes were frozen, and the sound of dripping water echoed through the abandoned corridors of the old research facility. The dim fluorescent lights above flickered ominously, casting eerie shadows on the walls as Gore paced back and forth, his eyes fixed on the makeshift control panel in front of him. The air was thick with the smell of smoke and grease, and the silence was only broken by the occasional creak of the old building settling around them. It was as if the very fabric of the place was warning them to turn back, to abandon their quest for answers and flee while they still could. But Gore was undeterred, his determination fueled by a mix of curiosity and desperation. He had to know what had happened here, what had driven the scientists to abandon their research and leave behind the remnants of their experiments. And so, with a deep breath, he reached out and flipped the switch, plunging the room into darkness."
"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer. I’m sure he knew plenty about ship’s rigging, but he’d probably never handled an instrument more technologically complex than a sextant. Men in their right minds are","not usually overcome with a mania for pulling the plumbing apart.

Yet, here he was, standing beside the chief engineer, a gruff, no-nonsense man named Thompson, who eyed him with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. Gore's eyes scanned the room, taking in the unfamiliar sights and sounds, his mind racing with the implications of this strange new world. He had been a naval officer, a man of tradition and discipline, and this was a far cry from the sailing ships he was used to. The hissing pipes seemed to be speaking a language he couldn't understand, and the whirring gears made him feel like a relic from another era. Thompson, sensing his unease, cleared his throat and began to explain the basics of the steam engine, but Gore's mind was elsewhere, lost in thoughts of the sea and the ships that had once been his home. He couldn't help but wonder how he had ended up here, in this strange, alien world, surrounded by the very machines that were supposed to be making his life easier. The chief engineer's words were a jumble of sounds, but Gore's ears picked up on one phrase, ""pressure gauge,"" and his eyes widened as he realized the implications. This was no ordinary ship, and he was no ordinary officer. He was a man out of time, a relic from a bygone era, and he had a feeling that his world was about to change forever."
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people.

He had a deep appreciation for the simple things, like watching the sunset over the mountains or listening to the songs of the birds in the forest. His passion for the outdoors was contagious, and I found myself drawn to it as well. We would often take long walks together, exploring the trails and talking about our dreams and aspirations. He had a way of making me feel seen and heard, like I was the only person in the world. His kindness, empathy, and understanding were qualities that I admired and aspired to, and I found myself learning from him every day. As I got to know him better, I realized that Gore was not just a person, but a true friend, a companion, and a kindred spirit. His presence in my life was a gift, and I was grateful for every moment we spent together."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea.

His eyes would cloud over, and his face would fall, and for a moment, he would be a man from another time, a man out of place in this modern world. But then, he would shake his head, and a hint of a smile would play on his lips, and he would continue on his way, a man from the past, navigating the unfamiliar streets of the present. He was a man of contradictions, a man of great wisdom and great sorrow, a man who had seen the best and worst of humanity, and yet, he still held onto hope. His story was a testament to the human spirit, a reminder that no matter where we come from, or when we live, we are all connected, and we are all searching for something more."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake.

We must also think about how these experiences have shaped their perceptions, behaviors, and relationships. It's essential to approach this with sensitivity and an open mind, acknowledging that everyone's journey is unique and complex. By doing so, we can gain a deeper understanding of the individuals and their needs, rather than simply relying on their historical context. This will allow us to provide more effective support and care, tailored to their specific circumstances. Furthermore, it's crucial to recognize that mental trauma can manifest in different ways, and what may seem like a minor issue to one person could be a significant challenge for another. By taking a holistic approach, we can better address the root causes of their struggles and work towards healing and recovery. This is not just about treating the symptoms; it's about understanding the person as a whole, with all their strengths and vulnerabilities. By doing so, we can empower them to take control of their lives and make informed decisions about their care. Ultimately, our goal is to provide a safe and supportive environment where they feel heard, validated, and empowered to heal and grow."

As I perused the menu, I noticed a peculiar item that caught my eye - a dish called ""Tournedos Rossini, à la Gore,"" which seemed to be a clever play on the name of our host. I wondered if it was more than just a coincidence, or if there was a deeper significance behind the choice of name. The waiter, a friendly man with a bushy mustache and a charming smile, noticed my interest and leaned in to recommend the dish, telling me that it was a family recipe, passed down through generations of Gores. I was intrigued, and decided to take his word for it, ordering the Tournedos Rossini with a glass of fine Bordeaux. As I waited for my food to arrive, I couldn't help but think about the story behind the dish, and the man who had inspired it. Little did I know, this meal would be more than just a pleasant interlude - it would be a key to unlocking a deeper understanding of Gore's past, and the secrets he had kept hidden for so long."
"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to",take us to”—here he raised his eyebrows—“a public house. I am looking forward to seeing what visions of sin this era has concocted for the humble tavern.”,"be built over the river, and that he would also provide me with a small house on the other side, where I could live in peace and quiet, free from the troubles",53,"be built over the river, and that he would also provide me with a small house on the other side, where I could live in peace and quiet, free from the troubles that had been plaguing me in the city. I was skeptical at first, but he seemed genuinely interested in helping me, and his words were laced with a sincerity that I found hard to resist. So, I agreed to his proposal, and he set to work on arranging everything. It wasn't long before the bridge was completed, and I found myself standing on the other side, looking out at the rolling hills and green forests that stretched out before me. The air was fresh and clean, and I felt a sense of freedom that I had not known in years. I was grateful to my new friend for giving me this new lease on life, and I looked forward to seeing what the future held for me in this peaceful new home."
"Back at the house I was still struggling to think of as “home,” Gore shyly asked me if I would also “come for a drink.” He had done well, at lunch, to hide his deep embarrassment over my payment",of the bill (with a Ministry expense card); he was adjusting with gold-star alacrity in recognizing that it wouldn’t be a reputation-detonating act for a respectable woman to be seen in a public house in the company of bachelors.,"His eyes darted around the room, avoiding mine as he fumbled with the ice cubes in the freezer, his hands shaking slightly as he tried to compose himself.

I couldn't help but notice the faint blush rising to his cheeks, a stark contrast to the confident, collected individual I had met just hours before. I nodded, trying to put him at ease, and he quickly poured two glasses of whiskey, his hands still trembling as he handed me one. We sat down at the kitchen table, the silence between us thick with unspoken words, the only sound the soft clinking of the ice cubes in our glasses. I took a sip, feeling the burn of the liquor as I tried to think of a way to break the tension, to ease the awkwardness that had settled over us like a shroud. Gore, sensing my unease, spoke up, his voice low and hesitant, ""So, how was your day?"" I hesitated, unsure of how much to reveal, but something about his genuine concern put me at ease, and I found myself opening up to him in ways I never thought possible."

The manager, Rachel, had to intervene and smooth things over, but it's been a bit of a sensitive topic ever since. It's not the first time something like this has happened, and it's starting to become a bit of a problem for the team's morale. The tension between Defence and Ralph is palpable, and it's affecting the way they work together. It's a delicate situation, and it's not clear how it's going to be resolved.

"Graham used other words too, not wrong, exactly, but not right, like “your people,” or “your culture.” When I said, in a wincingly tight voice, that we had the same people and culture, he replied, mildly, “But I don’t think that we do.” Then came the image searches about Cambodia, on food and dress","and customs.

But the captain's quick thinking and his own determination had seen him through, and eventually, the wound had healed, leaving behind a scar that would serve as a reminder of that fateful day. Years had passed since then, but the memory of it still lingered, a constant reminder of the risks they took as explorers, charting the uncharted and facing the unknown. The captain's words echoed in his mind, ""A true explorer must be prepared for anything, and that includes the unexpected."" He had taken those words to heart, and it was a mantra that had driven him to continue on, to push beyond the boundaries of what was thought possible. And now, as he stood on the deck of the ship, gazing out at the vast expanse of the ocean, he felt a sense of excitement and trepidation, knowing that the next great adventure was just on the horizon, waiting to be discovered."
"It’s surprising, then, that I allowed Graham’s drawing of the projection device to enter my files as a joke, like a coin minted 70 BC.

It was clear that Graham had a natural talent for engineering, one that went beyond mere doodling. I began to wonder if this was more than just a joke, if it was a glimpse into a future that Graham had envisioned for himself. The more I looked at the drawing, the more I saw the faint outlines of a machine, a device that seemed to defy the laws of physics as I knew them. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized that this was no ordinary doodle, but a blueprint for a revolutionary invention that could change the course of history. I knew I had to learn more about this device, to understand the genius behind it, and to see if it was more than just a product of Graham's imagination."

It was a peaceful routine, one that he'd grown accustomed to over the years, and one that he cherished deeply.

The past was a mystery, one that he'd never fully unraveled, but he was determined to keep moving forward, to keep living in the present, and to see where this new life would take him."

"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them. Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled","to focus on the tests—eyes moving rapidly. I once found him the sole occupant of the fifth-floor smoking area (a pigeon-shit-encrusted balcony), methodically shredding a filter of a finished cigarette.

However, this new setting also presented its own set of challenges, as the sounds of the café, the chatter of the patrons, and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee created a distracting background noise that made it difficult for the researchers to accurately measure the expats' physiological responses. Despite these challenges, the researchers persisted, determined to gather reliable data. They began to experiment with different types of stimuli, from images and videos to sounds and smells, in an attempt to elicit a stronger emotional response from the expats. Graham, in particular, was a challenging subject, as his anxiety levels seemed to spike at the slightest provocation, making it difficult for the researchers to determine whether his reactions were genuine or simply a result of his nervous temperament. The researchers also noticed that Graham's reactions were not isolated, as several other expats exhibited similar patterns of anxiety and emotional reactivity, leading them to wonder if there was something specific about the expats' experiences in the Ministry hospital wards that was causing these reactions. As the researchers continued to collect data, they began to formulate a hypothesis that the expats' exposure to the hospital environment had a profound impact on their emotional well-being, and that this impact was not limited to the time they spent in the hospital, but rather had a lasting effect on their mental health. They decided to investigate this hypothesis further, and began to design a new set of experiments that would allow them to explore the long-term effects of the expats' experiences in the Ministry hospital wards."
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too.

But it seemed that the test was not as effective as they had thought. The team leader, a middle-aged woman with a kind face, called a meeting to discuss the results and possible ways to improve the test.

Weeds sprouted from every inch of the soil, and the once-manicured lawn was now a tangled mess of wildflowers and grass.

I started to feel a growing sense of unease, a feeling that something was off, but I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was. The heat was taking its toll, and I was starting to wonder if we'd ever make it through this ordeal alive."
"Adela took bridge meetings in a soundproof room deep in the Ministry’s chest.

The other members of the team began to filter in, their conversations hushed as they took their seats, their eyes scanning the room with a sense of anticipation and unease. The door closed behind them, and the soundproofing mechanism engaged, plunging the room into an eerie silence. Adela's gaze never wavered from the agenda, her mind racing with the weight of the decisions that lay ahead, the fate of the Ministry hanging precariously in the balance. As the last member took their seat, Adela's eyes rose, her voice firm and commanding as she began to speak, her words dripping with an air of authority and gravitas. ""Let us proceed,"" she said, her voice echoing off the walls, ""we have much to discuss, and little time to waste."" The room fell silent, the only sound the soft hum of the air conditioning, as the team leaned in, their faces set with a mix of resolve and trepidation, ready to face whatever lay ahead."

She didn’t enjoy the prestige, as the Secretary did, and she seemed bizarrely overworked for the proxy boss of a project in its pilot stage.","no one knew, but what was clear was that she had a hidden agenda, one that she was determined to keep under wraps, at least for now.

She seemed to be enjoying the power and the prestige that came with the title, but there was a hint of desperation in her eyes, a sense that she was fighting to prove herself in a world where she didn't quite fit in. As she spoke, her words dripped with condescension, a subtle reminder that she was the one in charge, and we were just mere mortals, lucky to be in her presence. Her voice was like a cold wind, cutting through the air, leaving us all feeling chilled to the bone, wondering what we had gotten ourselves into, and whether we would ever be able to escape the clutches of this icy, calculating woman."

The soft murmur of conversation from the other patrons and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air, but my attention remained fixed on him, my mind racing with questions and curiosity."
"Graham blew smoke out through his nose reflectively. “I see,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s fair to call him ‘grim,’ though you wouldn’t be the","first to say it. He was a severe disciplinarian, it’s true. Held grudges. But he was a very lonely person. Romantic, too, which made his loneliness worse.”","first to admit it.

As Graham watched him, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy - this was a man who had lived a life, and lived it to the fullest, while Graham was still just trying to find his place in the world."
"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders. The bridges kept turning in their core reports, and the experiments kept running.

I stopped socializing with my colleagues, stopped participating in team meetings, and stopped contributing to the project. I was a ghost hovering on the periphery, watching but not participating. And yet, despite my growing detachment, the data kept coming in, and the computer kept crunching. It was as if the project was running on autopilot, driven by a momentum that I couldn't quite grasp.

"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events. He’d lain motionless in the garden for two hours, on","a wet and putrid night, to shoot a fox, and pulled out one of his own rotting teeth (he showed it to me afterward; it was the color of a tombstone, caped with gelatinous red)—was this Victorian, or was this “irregularities”?","completion> his favorite bench, staring blankly at the sky, his eyes fixed on some invisible point above the trees.

The sun beat down on him, but he didn't flinch, his skin a deep shade of tan from years of spending countless afternoons in this very spot. I had grown accustomed to his solitary nature, but this level of stillness was unsettling, and I found myself glancing at my watch for what felt like the hundredth time, wondering if I should intervene or simply let him be. The air was heavy with the scent of blooming flowers and fresh-cut grass, a stark contrast to the unease that had settled in the pit of my stomach. I took a step closer, my eyes locked on his face, searching for any sign of recognition or awareness, but his expression remained frozen, a mask of serenity that belied the turmoil that might be brewing beneath the surface. As I stood there, frozen in indecision, the silence between us grew thicker, a palpable presence that seemed to vibrate with an unspoken question: was this a moment of profound insight, or a descent into madness?"

"I persuaded Graham to use the tiny office, in which I ordinarily worked, to cram for the test.

The small office was cluttered with stacks of papers and books, but Graham's workspace was surprisingly tidy, with every item neatly organized and labeled. I, on the other hand, had a habit of piling my notes and materials haphazardly, which often led to wasted time searching for a specific document or piece of information. As I studied, I found myself envying Graham's system and wishing I could be more like him, but I knew that my own learning style was different, and I had to adapt to it. Despite our differences, we worked together in comfortable silence, the only sound being the occasional rustling of papers or the soft hum of the air conditioner. The hours ticked by, and the sun began to set outside, casting a warm orange glow through the window, but we didn't notice, too engrossed in our studies. As the evening wore on, I started to feel a sense of unease, a nagging feeling that we were missing something crucial, but I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was. Graham, however, seemed oblivious to my concerns, and I wondered if he was just being too optimistic or if he genuinely believed we were prepared.

The carpet was stained with mysterious splatters, and the windowsills were cluttered with a jumble of books, papers, and broken dreams. The clock on the wall read 3:47, a reminder that time was slipping away, and she was no closer to finding order in the chaos. The phone on the counter was dead, its screen a blank slate, a reflection of her own empty heart. I sighed, knowing that this was just the beginning of a long and arduous process of cleaning up the mess that was her life."
Margaret appeared unaware of any of these concerns. She didn’t even glance at herself,in the mirror. She gave me an interested grin as I pulled out my lipsticks.,"in the mirror, too caught up in the conversation with her best friend, Emily,",29,"in the mirror, too caught up in the conversation with her best friend, Emily, who was regaling her with stories of her latest romantic escapades, completely oblivious to the fact that Margaret's hair was a tangled mess and her dress was stained with last night's dinner."

As she worked, she told me about the different types of powder available, from translucent to colored, and how each one could be used to enhance or conceal various features. I listened intently, fascinated by the way she transformed my appearance with each new product, and I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets she held in her vast collection of cosmetics."
"The door grumbled shut and I fell back into a doze. Margaret was snoring lightly, like a puppy being squeezed. The door reopened, and I","surfaced to vague consciousness.

I swung my legs over the side of the bed and planted my feet firmly on the ground, feeling the cool air on my skin. The silence was oppressive, and I felt a shiver run down my spine as I stood up, my eyes scanning the room for any sign of movement or disturbance. The clock on the nightstand read 3:47 AM, and I knew I had to get back to sleep, but my mind was racing with thoughts and questions, refusing to let me rest."
"All the expats had phones, paid for (and tapped) by the Ministry. Graham had switched his own phone on a total of three times in the seven","months he had been in the twenty-first century.

The Ministry's surveillance was all-pervasive, and Graham had grown accustomed to the feeling of being watched, even in the privacy of his own home. He had tried to adapt, to blend in with the locals, but it was hard to shake the sense that he was being constantly scrutinized. The expats had formed a tight-knit community, a support network of sorts, and they would often gather at the local café to share stories and gossip about their experiences. But even there, Graham couldn't shake the feeling that they were all being watched, that their conversations were being recorded and analyzed by the Ministry's all-seeing eye. He had tried to push the thoughts aside, to focus on his work, but it was hard to concentrate when he felt like he was living in a fishbowl. The Ministry's grip on the town was suffocating, and Graham wondered how much longer he could endure it before he lost his mind."
"Arthur was striding up the street, bent slightly against a wind which didn’t exist. He was wearing a tweed jacket and looked like a period piece,","but then again, so did Pimlico.

"It paid off in the early autumn. When I came down for breakfast one morning, I found","Graham at the counter with a dictionary and a tin of protein powder, performing exegesis on the label.","my mother sitting in the dining room, her eyes fixed on a letter in her hand, a look of deep concern etched",35,"my mother sitting in the dining room, her eyes fixed on a letter in her hand, a look of deep concern etched on her face.

It was from my father, and as I read the words on the page, my heart sank, for it was a letter that would change everything, a letter that would set in motion a chain of events that would alter the course of my life forever."
"Adela was of the “never been to the GP in my life because I’m not a pussy” school of care, and nothing changed.

She'd always been a bit of a rebel, never one to follow the crowd or take things at face value. So when she met Dr. Lee, a soft-spoken but firm expat doctor who was determined to change her ways, she was more than a little skeptical. Little did she know, their encounter would be the start of a journey that would challenge everything she thought she knew about healthcare, and herself."
"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs. Given the prevalence of prostitution in Victorian England, the nonexistence of reliable barrier contraception in his era, and the fact that he was a sailor, this suggested he was either a virgin or very lucky. But then again, I knew enough about his biography to know that he was very, very lucky.","of the report, but it didn't reveal much more than that. Graham's stoic demeanor made it difficult for the analyst to get a read on him, and I couldn't help but wonder if he was hiding something.

I respected his boundaries, but it was hard not to feel a little frustrated. I had a hard time understanding how someone as intelligent and perceptive as Graham could be so oblivious to the complexities of human relationships. I decided to try a different approach, asking him about his past, hoping to get a glimpse into what made him tick. But Graham was tight-lipped about his childhood, his family, and his life before the Ministry. It was as if he'd been trained to keep his personal life under wraps, and I couldn't help but wonder what secrets he might be hiding. As the days went by, our conversations became stilted, and I found myself feeling increasingly isolated from him. I knew I had to tread carefully, but I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to Graham than met the eye."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory. Every time I gave Graham a book, I was trying to shunt him along a story I’d been telling myself all my life.","something about her that made me want to fill in the gaps, to tell her about the world beyond the confines of her sheltered life.

I thought about all the things I'd learned from my years of traveling, the stories I'd heard from people I'd met along the way, and the lessons I'd picked up from my own experiences. I wanted to share it all with her, to see the spark of understanding ignite in her eyes as she grasped the complexities of the world. But I knew better than to try to impose my views on her, to force her to see things from my perspective. I had to let her find her own way, to discover the world in her own time. And so I smiled again, this time with a sense of resignation, and turned back to my book, leaving her to her own thoughts. The sound of the rain outside created a soothing melody that seemed to match the rhythm of my heartbeat, and I let myself get lost in the words on the page, the world outside fading into the background. As I read, I couldn't help but steal glances at Margaret, who was now engrossed in her own book, her eyes scanning the pages with a look of intense concentration. I wondered what she was reading, whether it was something that would change her life, or simply a distraction from the monotony of her daily routine. The thought made me smile, and I felt a sense of connection to her, a sense of understanding that went beyond words. We were two people, lost in our own worlds, yet somehow connected by the shared experience of being in this place, at this time. And as the rain continued to fall outside, I felt a sense of peace wash over me, a sense of belonging that I hadn't felt in a long time."
Graham was adamant about not informing the Ministry about his illness. It was the closest I had,ever seen him to entreating. I thought about it a lot. I liked being entreated by him.,"seen him come close to revealing a secret, and I knew that if he found out I had discovered",34,"seen him come close to revealing a secret, and I knew that if he found out I had discovered his condition, he would be devastated.

"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled. Then again, whose upper management am I not describing? Who trusts their workplace? Who thinks their job is on the side of right?

I'm trapped in this nightmare, forced to confront the reality of what I've done. And the worst part is, I'm not even sure if I can forgive myself."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.","that I had managed to get my hands on the infamous artifact, a relic from a civilization long thought to be",39,"that I had managed to get my hands on the infamous artifact, a relic from a civilization long thought to be extinct, and what I planned to do with it next.

The artifact, a small, intricately carved stone, glowed with an otherworldly energy, and I could see the curiosity getting the better of him, his eyes fixed intently on the object as I continued to speak, my words weaving a spell of intrigue and mystery."
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.","his fingers, staring out the window at the darkening sky.

I hung my coat on the hook by the door and walked over to join Graham, who looked up at me with a hint of a smile on his face. ""Hey, how was your day?"" he asked, his voice low and smooth, the smoke from his cigarette curling lazily into the air. I took a seat next to him and leaned back in my chair, feeling the soft creak of the wooden legs as I settled in. ""It was good,"" I replied, watching as he took a long drag on his cigarette, the ember glowing brightly in the fading light. The tension in the room was palpable, a sense of expectation hanging in the air like a challenge, and I couldn't help but wonder what the evening had in store for us."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers. He took in anecdotes about my childhood meals as if they would contribute to a portrait of a whole woman. He ignored the fact that mostly I cooked assorted chicken pieces on rice. I could tell him things about galangal, and he found that very profound.","When I was a child, my mother would often cook traditional dishes from our family's cultural heritage, and Graham's curiosity about the aromas and flavors was palpable.

He would sit at the kitchen table, his eyes wide with wonder, as I described the various ingredients and cooking techniques that went into each dish. His fascination with Southeast Asian cuisine was not just about the taste, but also about the stories and traditions behind each recipe. As he listened intently, I could see the gears turning in his mind, as he tried to connect the dots between the food, the people, and the culture. His sketchbook, which he always carried with him, began to fill up with drawings of the dishes we talked about, the ingredients, and the people who prepared them. The alien shapes of the transmission towers that he sketched earlier seemed to pale in comparison to the intricate patterns and colors of the Southeast Asian cuisine, which he was now obsessed with. His friends and family started to notice the change in him, and they would often joke that he had been ""infected"" by the flavors and aromas of the food. But Graham didn't mind, he was too busy exploring the world of Southeast Asian cuisine, one dish at a time."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization. I wanted him in a role that didn’t require him to be at sea for months, possibly years,","at a time. It was too soon, I told myself.

It was humiliating to know that about myself and to say nothing into his implacable placidity.","as I had grown accustomed to having him by my side, and the thought of being apart from him for such extended periods was unbearable.

He was determined to find a position that would utilize his skills and experience, while I was looking for something that would allow me to contribute to the community and learn the language more effectively. We were both eager to start this new chapter of our lives, but the uncertainty of it all was daunting. The expat community was tight-knit, and everyone seemed to know each other, making it difficult for us to break in. We had to navigate the complexities of a new culture, a new language, and a new way of life, all while trying to build a life together. It was a daunting task, but we were determined to make it work, and we were excited to see what the future held for us."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.","The mellow melody and harmonies of the song blended awkwardly with the tension in the room, but Graham didn't seem to notice as he continued to work on his project, his fingers flying across the",64,"The mellow melody and harmonies of the song blended awkwardly with the tension in the room, but Graham didn't seem to notice as he continued to work on his project, his fingers flying across the keyboard with a practiced ease that belied the complexity of the task at hand. The lyrics of the song, however, caught the attention of his coworker, Emily, who couldn't help but hum along as she pored over the stack of documents in front of her. As the song transitioned into the instrumental break, Graham's phone suddenly buzzed with an incoming text message, breaking the spell of concentration that had settled over the room."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes. One of his first searches was charmingly housewifely: “Most challenging recipes”; “How to make cheese soufflé”; “What is miso paste?”; “Where to buy miso paste”; “How long has Japan been open to Europe?” A day or so after I’d read this report, I received another that listed the following search terms:","of his mind, or worse, that he'd stumbled upon some dark corner of the internet where he'd discovered a new and disturbing fascination with the occult.

I breathed a sigh of relief, thinking that perhaps Graham was not as lost as I had feared. However, it wasn't until I saw the report that really made me question his sanity: ""how to build a treehouse."" I raised an eyebrow, wondering what kind of treehouse he was planning to build, and whether it was going to be a reflection of his inner turmoil or just a harmless childhood fantasy. I decided to keep a closer eye on him, just in case."
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing,","as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday. This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option. We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit. Still, we had not told them about the death camps.","The makeshift barriers were a testament to the community's resilience, a patchwork of wooden planks and plastic sheeting that seemed to be holding back the deluge.

The air was thick with the smell of wet earth and ozone, and the sound of raindrops pounding against the makeshift barriers created a constant, soothing background hum. As I made my way through the crowd, I noticed a group of children playing in the shallows, their laughter and shouts carrying above the din of the storm. They were splashing in the water, their faces alight with joy, and for a moment, the chaos and uncertainty of the situation seemed to fade away. But as I watched, a loud crack of thunder boomed through the air, and the children's laughter was quickly replaced by nervous glances at their parents.

I could feel the weight of the thing in my chest, a heavy, oppressive presence that seemed to be growing by the second. I tried to push it away, but it only seemed to press in closer, making it hard to breathe.

But it was too late, the darkness was already winning, and I felt myself slipping away into the void."
