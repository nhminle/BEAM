"Yet his books continued to sell, so his business affairs continued. I went over the contract renewals, cover concepts, and the occasional movie or TV option","with him, and I dutifully read every interview proposal once he was incapable of reading them himself. He always said no, and that included Ruth Crawford’s proposal.",53,"to guide the creative team. Despite the challenges, there was a certain satisfaction in seeing his stories reach a wider audience. The process was meticulous, requiring attention to detail and a deep understanding of both the literary and the visual aspects of his work. Each decision, from the choice of illustrator to the design of the book cover, was crucial in conveying the essence of his narratives to the reader. The contracts were a web of legalities, ensuring that the rights were protected and that the terms were favorable for both parties. The movie and TV options presented their own set of challenges, needing to translate the written word into a visual medium while staying true to the spirit of the original text. It was a delicate balance, but one that he approached with the same dedication and meticulousness that had characterized his writing career."
"“Give her the standard response, Mark—flattered to be asked, but no","thanks.” He hesitated, though, because this one was a little different.",22,"She's not interested, and it's best to respect her decision. Let's move on to other matters."
"“Butch and I were kids going to a one-room schoolhouse before the Second World War. We grew up in a no-stoplight dirt-road town fixing cars, patching them up, playing sports and then coaching them. As men we took part in town politics and maintained the town dump—very similar jobs, now that I think about it. We hunted, we fished, we put out grassfires in the summer and plowed the town roads in the winter. Knocked over a right smart of mailboxes doing it, too. I knew","him when no one knew his name—or mine—outside of a twenty-mile radius. I should have come to see him these last years, but I was busy with my own affairs. I thought to myself, there’s time. We always think that, I guess. Then time runs out. Butch was a fine artist, but he was also a good man. I think that’s more important. Maybe some here don’t and that’s all right, that’s all right. Thing is, I always had his back and he always had mine.”",172,
“Has to be a reason?” Pop asked when I finished reading him Ms. Crawford’s letter. “Is that what she’s suggesting? I guess,she never heard about the twin brothers who won large sums of money in their respective state lotteries on the same day.”,44,"it's not just her implication but the whole situation that's making me wonder,"" I explained, trying to articulate the tangled web of emotions and suspicions that had been gnawing at me. ""There's something off about the way she's acting, and this letter is just the tip of the iceberg. It's like she's hiding something, maybe even protecting someone. Why else would she be so evasive and then drop this bombshell out of the blue? It doesn't add up, Pop. There's definitely more to this story than meets the eye."""
“Just that I can understand this woman’s interest in exploring the fact of you and Dave both coming from Nowheresville and blossoming,in the middle of your lives.” I raised my hands beside my head as if framing a headline. “Could it be… fate?”,44,"into successful careers in New York City,"" she continued, her eyes sparkling with curiosity and a hint of admiration. ""It's like a real-life fairy tale, isn't it? Two small-town kids making it big in the big city."" Her voice carried a mix of excitement and disbelief, as if she was still trying to wrap her head around the improbability of their journey. ""I mean, it's not every day you meet someone who can tell a story like that, with so much heart and determination."" She paused, taking a sip of her coffee, then added, ""It's inspiring, really. Makes you wonder what's possible if you just believe and work hard enough, doesn't it?"" Her gaze lingered on them, seeking their reaction, eager to understand more about their experiences and the challenges they had faced along the way. "
"So that was what I did, although something about the way Pop looked just then stuck with me. It was the look of a man who could say quite","a lot on the subject of how he and his friend Butch had achieved fame and fortune… but who chose not to. Who chose, in fact, to keep it close.",59,"clearly, 'no' if he were asked. His eyes, usually so lively and warm, had dimmed, and his lips were pressed into a thin line. It was a look I had never seen before, and it sent a chill down my spine. I couldn't shake off the feeling that Pop knew more than he was letting on about what had happened that night. The incident had been traumatic, leaving the neighborhood in shock, and now, seeing Pop like that, I felt a growing urge to dig deeper, to uncover the truth that seemed to be hidden just beneath the surface. My curiosity was piqued, and I knew I had to find out what had happened to bring about such a profound change in my usually jovial grandfather."
"“They used to pal around together back in grade school,” Alden told her. “Just a couple of boys who liked to fish or go hunting with their daddies. They grew up around hard work and","didn’t expect nothing different. You might talk to folks my age who’ll tellya those boys were going to amount to something, but I’m not one of em. They were ordinary fellas right up until they weren’t.”",71,"their families depended on it. They learned early on that a man's word was his bond, and they lived by that creed. As they grew older, those childhood friendships turned into something more substantial, a bond that was tested and proven over time. They found themselves in the military, where their shared values were not only accepted but expected. In the heat of battle, they had each other's backs, a trust that was unspoken but deeply rooted. When they returned home, they settled in the same small town, each building their own life while remaining close. They married, had children, and watched them grow, all the while maintaining that unbreakable connection. As years passed, their hair turned gray, and their bodies weakened, but their friendship remained as strong as ever. They spent their golden years reminiscing about the past, fishing by the old creek where they first learned the joys of camaraderie, and hunting in the woods that had been their playground. Their daddies had taught them well, and they lived out their days as testament to the enduring power of friendship, hard work, and the unbreakable bond of a man's word."
"I read a review of Pop’s first book, The Lightning Storm, and the reviewer said this: “Not much happens in the","first hundred or so pages of Mr. Carmody’s suspenseful yarn, but the reader is drawn on anyway, because there are violins.”",42,"story, and the characters are poorly developed."" I found this comment quite surprising, as I had just finished reading the book and felt it was a thrilling adventure with well-rounded characters. The reviewer seemed to miss the intricate plot twists and the emotional depth that Pop managed to convey through his writing. Perhaps they were expecting a different genre or style, or maybe they simply didn't connect with the characters on the same level that I did. Regardless, I believe that The Lightning Storm offers a rich narrative experience that dives deep into human emotions and the complexities of relationships during a tumultuous time."
"I knew a lot of this. I learned more from Ruth Crawford herself at the Korner Koffee Kup, across the street from the Gateway Motel and just about a block down from the post office. That’s where Pop got his mail,","and there was usually a pretty damn good budget of it. I always stopped at the Koffee Kup after grabbing the post. The Kup’s java is strictly okay, no more than that, but the blueberry muffins? You never had a better one.",83,"where he would sit on the old wooden bench outside, reading the letters from his friends back in Indiana. Ruth Crawford, with her sharp wit and even sharper mind, would often stop by, her auburn hair catching the sunlight, her eyes sparkling with the secrets of the universe. She'd lean against the wall, arms crossed, and listen to Pop's stories about the old days, his voice carrying over the pavement and into the air, mingling with the scent of fresh-cut grass and the distant hum of traffic. Ruth would chime in with her own tales, tales of traveling across the country in a beat-up old car, of meeting fascinating people, and of discovering the beauty in the mundane. Her stories were like threads, weaving a rich tapestry of experiences that connected us all, reminding us that every life is a story waiting to be told. She spoke of the struggles and triumphs, the laughter and tears, the love and loss, with a raw honesty that was both refreshing and poignant. Her words painted pictures in the air, vivid and alive, drawing me in with their magnetic pull. I would sit there, enraptured, as Ruth's voice painted worlds I had never imagined, worlds filled with possibility and wonder. She taught me that knowledge isn't just about facts and figures; it's about understanding the human experience, the connections we forge, and the stories we carry within us. Ruth Crawford, with her infectious enthusiasm for life and learning, showed me that education is a journey, not a destination. It's about curiosity, exploration, and the relentless pursuit of truth. Her lessons at the Korner Koffee Kup were invaluable, shaping my worldview and igniting a passion for discovery that has stayed with me ever since. As I grew older, I often thought back to those conversations, to the wisdom Ruth shared so freely, and to the profound impact she had on my life. Ruth Crawford, with her vibrant spirit and boundless knowledge, left an indelible mark on everyone she met, and her legacy lives on in the stories she shared and the minds she inspired."
"It was Ruth Crawford, looking slim and trim in white slacks, a pink shell top, and a matching mask—that was the second year","of Covid. She was already sliding into the other side of the booth, which made me laugh. “You don’t give up, do you?”",46,"of her vacation in St. Moritz. Her hair was styled in a chic bob, and her sunglasses reflected the bright Swiss sun as she strolled along the cobblestone streets, her heels clicking rhythmically. Beside her, her husband, a tall man with a distinguished air, wore a gray suit that complemented Ruth's outfit perfectly. They were the epitome of elegance, capturing the essence of the wealthy travelers who flocked to the famous resort town each summer, seeking respite from the heat of their home country. Ruth's mask, a gift from a local artisan, added a touch of local charm to her ensemble, a memento of her beloved vacation. As they paused to admire a small, picturesque lake nestled among the mountains, Ruth couldn't help but feel a surge of contentment; this was the life she had always dreamed of."
"“Not bad. As you must know, since you’re staying right across the street.","The muffins are better. But still no interview. Sorry, Ms. Crawford, can’t do it.”",27,"It's quite peculiar that you haven't introduced yourself yet, considering our close proximity."
"“I swear. I found out that Dave won the annual town fair pie-eating contest from 1960 to 1966, when he retired from competition. I learned that your father sat","on the ducking stool at Old Home Days until 1972. There are amusing pictures of him in one of those old-fashioned bathing suits and a derby hat… waterproof, I assume.”",59,"on the judging panel every year, always casting a vote for Dave's pies, which were legendary for their sweetness and richness. It wasn't just his talent with pastry that kept him winning; it was the secret ingredient he used, a rare spice blend that he guarded like a treasure. Your father, with his discerning palate and unwavering support, became a sort of co-conspirator in Dave's string of victories. They shared many laughs and stories about those years, often reminiscing over a slice of Dave's famous apple pie, which, to this day, remains a family favorite recipe."
"“I learned that when Dave went west, he packed everything he felt he needed into the saddlebags of his Harley-Davidson motorcycle and just took off.",Your father and mother sold everything else he owned at a yard sale and sent him the money. Your dad also sold his house for him.”,51,"He didn't leave a forwarding address or a single contact number; it was as if he vanished into thin air. His departure was sudden, leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions and a family in shock. His sister, Sarah, couldn't help but wonder if he was running away from something or someone, or if he was searching for something he couldn't find at home. The community was abuzz with rumors, speculating about his motives, but no one knew for sure. Weeks turned into months, and the hope of seeing him again slowly faded, replaced by a mix of confusion and concern. His disappearance became a topic of conversation at local diners and community gatherings, with people sharing their theories and experiences with those who had vanished without a trace. Meanwhile, Dave roamed the highways, his only company the open road and the memories of the life he left behind. He traveled through landscapes that shifted from the rugged beauty of mountain passes to the endless horizons of the desert, each mile taking him further from the familiar and deeper into the unknown. Along the way, he encountered strangers who became friends, stories that enriched his understanding of the world, and moments of clarity that helped him make sense of his own journey. Despite the uncertainty of his destination, Dave found a sense of freedom and purpose in his travels, discovering parts of himself he never knew existed. His adventure was a testament to the unpredictable nature of life, where a single decision could lead to an entirely new chapter filled with unforeseen experiences and revelations."
"“At a pretty nice profit,” I said. “Which was good. By then Uncle Butch","was painting full-time, and he used that money until he started selling his work.”",28,"had already started planning his next big score. He was always looking for the next opportunity to make a quick buck, often without considering the consequences. His schemes were elaborate, yet he had a knack for getting others involved, making it harder for them to back out. This time, he had convinced a group of us to participate in a risky venture that promised high returns. We were all aware of the potential dangers, but Uncle Butch's charm and the allure of easy money clouded our judgment. Little did we know, this particular scheme would spiral out of control, leading us into a web of deceit and danger."
"I remember a call I got in the fall of 1978, the dormitory mom (there actually were such things back then) puffing up to the third floor of","Roberts Hall and telling me my mother was on the phone and sounded upset. I hurried down to Mrs. Hathaway’s little suite, afraid of what I might hear.",56,"our dormitory building at the University of Vermont. She was carrying a tray of freshly baked cookies, the sweet aroma trailing behind her as she ascended the creaky wooden stairs. Her mission was to deliver these treats to the students who were buried in textbooks, the stress of midterms looming over them. As she reached my room, she handed me a cookie, her face creased with a warm, knowing smile. ""These are for you,"" she said, her voice gentle and reassuring. ""You look like you could use a little sweetness in your life."" Her kindness, unexpected and genuine, was a small but powerful reminder that amidst the chaos of student life, there were still acts of pure, unassuming generosity. That moment, simple as it was, became a cherished memory, a beacon of warmth in the often cold corridors of academia. It was a testament to the power of human connection and the impact of small, thoughtful gestures. From that day on, I made it a point to pay forward the kindness shown to me, hoping to spark similar moments in others' lives."
“Yes. No. I don’t know. Something happened to your father while they were on,"their hunting trip in the 30-Mile Wood.” Then, as if an afterthought: “And to Butch.”",29,"his hunting trip,"" she said, her voice trembling with emotion. ""He disappeared without a trace, and we've been searching ever since."" Her eyes, filled with worry and fear, met his, conveying the depth of their concern and the mystery that had haunted their family for years. ""We need to find out what happened to him,"" she continued, her resolve firm despite the trembling of her hands. ""It's the least we can do for him."" The weight of her words hung heavy in the air, a silent vow between them to uncover the truth and bring their father home. "
"“Maybe they went down to the crossroads,” she said. “You know, like",Robert Johnson was supposed to have done. Made a deal with the devil.”,25,"the old legend suggests, to wait for the spirits of the departed?” Her voice trailed off, filled with a mix of hope and uncertainty, as they stood at the familiar junction where the roads diverged, each path shrouded in mist and mystery."
"Ruth knew where the house was, of course. I’d seen her cruise past in her little Corolla several times, and once she stopped to snap pictures. I’m sure she also knew that Pop","was most apt to walk our picket fence, looking at the daylilies, at midmorning, and if you don’t know by this point that she was a very determined lady, I haven’t done my job.",67,"had a penchant for gardening, often tending to his prized roses with a passion that seemed to rival his love for his family. Ruth, with her keen eye for beauty, likely appreciated the vibrant blooms as much as he did. Her interest in photography, as evidenced by her stopping to snap pictures, suggested she valued capturing moments and memories, perhaps seeing the garden as a picturesque scene to immortalize. It was not uncommon for neighbors to share such simple pleasures, forming an unspoken bond over the quiet joys of everyday life. Ruth's familiarity with the neighborhood and her actions indicated a friendly rapport, possibly indicating that she might have been a neighbor or someone who took an interest in the community's character and its inhabitants."
"Two days after our off-the-record talk in the Koffee Kup, she came slow-rolling down Benson Street, and instead of driving past, she pulled over and stopped right next to the little signs on either side of the gate. One says PLEASE","RESPECT OUR PRIVACY. The other says MR. CARMODY DOES NOT GIVE AUTOGRAPHS. I was walking with Pop as I usually did when he inspected the daylilies; he turned eighty-eight in that summer of 2021, and even with the cane he sometimes tottered.",83,"of the request, I continued the passage: ""and the other reads NO PARKING,"" I finished, observing the scene. Her car was parked right there, blocking the narrow street, which was usually bustling with morning traffic. She sat in her car, looking out the window, lost in thought. I approached her vehicle, wondering what brought her back to this quiet neighborhood. Her expression was unreadable, her eyes fixed on some unseen point in the distance. I cleared my throat gently to get her attention. She turned, and her eyes met mine, a mix of surprise and recognition flashing across them. ""I was just passing by,"" she said, her voice a soft murmur, betraying none of the confidence she projected during our previous conversation. ""I couldn't help but stop,"" I replied, trying to keep the conversation light. ""It's been a while,"" she noted, her gaze drifting back to the signs. ""Yes, it has,"" I agreed, wondering if this was a chance encounter or something more orchestrated. ""Do you often come back here?"" I asked, hoping to steer the conversation in a direction that felt natural. She sighed, a long, drawn-out sound that seemed to carry the weight of unspoken stories. ""Sometimes,"" she admitted, her eyes finally meeting mine again, this time with a hint of vulnerability. ""It's a place that holds a lot of memories for me,"" she confessed, her voice barely above a whisper. ""Good memories?"" I inquired, genuinely curious. ""Mixed,"" she replied, her lips curving into a small, bittersweet smile. ""Some are sweet, some are bitter."" Her honesty caught me off guard, and I found myself at a loss for words, which was unusual for me. ""I understand,"" I said after a moment, trying to bridge the gap between us. ""Life's like that, isn't it? Full of contrasts."" She nodded, her expression softening. ""Yes, it is. And sometimes, you just need to stop and reflect on those moments, even if they're painful."" I couldn't help but agree with her. ""Exactly,"" I said, feeling a connection forming between us. ""It's important to acknowledge all parts of our past, even the ones we'd rather forget."" Her eyes met mine once more, and this time, there was a spark of something new - understanding, perhaps, or even a hint of hope. ""Thank you for understanding,"" she said, her voice stronger now. ""It's not often that someone gets it without me having to explain everything."" I smiled, feeling a sense of camaraderie. ""Well, I believe everyone has their own stories, their own battles. It's what makes us human."" She smiled back, a genuine, warm smile that seemed to light up her face. ""You're right,"" she agreed. ""And maybe it's time I start sharing some of mine."" The conversation flowed more easily from there, as if a barrier had been broken. We talked for hours, about our lives, our dreams, and the things that had held us back. It was a conversation that felt both new and inevitable, as if the universe had conspired to bring us together at that very moment. As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the neighborhood, I realized that this encounter, seemingly random and unplanned, had turned into something meaningful. It was a reminder that life is full of unexpected moments, and sometimes, all it takes is a stop at a gate with signs saying PLEASE and NO PARKING to change the course of a day, and perhaps, the trajectory of two lives."
"Ruth got out and approached the fence, although she made no effort to try the gate. Persistent, but also mindful of boundaries. I liked her for that.","Hell, I liked her, period. She was wearing a flower-printed mask. Pop wasn’t, claimed they made it hard to breathe, but he’d had no objections to the vaccinations.",55,"She seemed to carry a quiet strength, a determination that didn't scream but resonated deeply within her. Her eyes, scanning the expanse of the property, held a mix of curiosity and caution. It was this balance that made her approachable yet intriguing, someone who respected the world around her while still yearning to explore it. Her presence was understated, yet it commanded attention, drawing me closer to the fence, not to join her, but to better understand the person behind such a poised demeanor."
"“Hunting in the 30-Mile,” he said promptly. “We went the second week of November from the time we were teenagers right up until Butch mounted his steel pony and set sail for the golden west. We stayed at a little cabin in the woods that my grandfather built. Butch claimed that his grandfather pitched in when it came to the roofing, which might or might not have been true. It","was a quarter-mile or so beyond Jilasi Creek. We had an old Willys jeep, and until ’54 or ’55, we drove it across the plank bridge, parked on the other side, and humped it to the cabin with our packs and our rifles. Then we got so we didn’t trust the Willys on the bridge because floods had undercut it some, so we’d park on the town side and walk across.”",141,
"“If they’re gonna pick,” Butch said, “we should give em a day to do it when we can",watch out for em and make sure some juicer or pothead doesn’t gash a leg and get gangrene.”,36,"prepare ourselves,"" he continued, ""so we're not caught off guard. We need to be ready for whatever they decide, whether it's a fight or something else. It's about respect and showing them we're not to be taken lightly."""
Butch started across. I could hear the hollow clonk of his bootheels over the sound of the creek.,"When he got to the other side he put down his gear, dropped his pants, and mooned me.",36,"He moved with a determined pace, the chill of the early morning air biting at his face. The trees whispered secrets as he passed, their leaves rustling in the gentle breeze. The path ahead was unclear, but Butch pressed on, driven by an unseen force that urged him to continue his journey into the unknown."
"As we tarped NellyBelle to keep her from filling up with rain, Butch said, “This","is the time one of us will go in the drink, you wait and see.”",30,"is just a temporary solution; we need to find a more permanent way to protect her from the weather.” The group nodded in agreement, knowing that their journey depended on the safety and well-being of their beloved horse."
"The next day we ate a picnic lunch in the clearing, looking across the creek—which was more like a river that day—at NellyBelle. Butch made sandwiches, which","he could be trusted to do. There was sweet water from our well to drink, and Hostess Fruit Pies for afters: blueberry for me, apple for Butch.",54,"turned out to be surprisingly delicious, especially with the fresh berries we picked earlier. As we sat on the blanket, enjoying the simple pleasure of our meal, NellyBelle trotted over, her coat shining in the sunlight. She seemed eager to join us, perhaps hoping for a taste of the sandwiches. Butch, ever the gentle giant, carefully broke off a small piece and held it out to her. NellyBelle accepted it with a grateful nicker, her eyes twinkling with contentment. The afternoon passed quickly, filled with laughter and stories, as we basked in the warmth of friendship and the beauty of nature."
"The young man dipped into his bag and brought out something that looked like a spectacle case. It was gray, with a silver shape like a","sine wave embossed on the lid. He held it in his lap. He repeated, “Most people wouldn’t have done what you did. We owe you. For Ylla.”",53,"small, curved blade. He opened it carefully, revealing a sharp, gleaming edge. With a swift motion, he flicked it open, the blade catching the light as he held it out, ready to be used for whatever purpose he had in mind."
"A ragged bolt of lightning struck the barn. It hit with a hollow bang, like the report of a shotgun muffled in a blanket. Jack barely had time to register",it before the follow-thunder bellowed. He saw the weathervane—an iron rooster—turn red with the heat and begin spinning even as it sagged and runnels of fire spread down the barn’s roof.,61,"the shockwave that followed. The barn, a once sturdy structure, now seemed to crumble from within, its wooden beams splintering and the roof collapsing in on itself. A thick, acrid smoke billowed out, obscuring the view of the surrounding fields. Jack, his heart pounding in his chest, stumbled back, his mind racing to comprehend the disaster that had just unfolded before his eyes. The storm, which had been raging for hours, seemed to intensify, its fury unleashed upon the small, defenseless building. He knew he had to act quickly; the barn, though ruined, was home to his beloved horses, their safety now uncertain amidst the chaos. With a sense of urgency, he shouted for his neighbors, hoping their help would arrive in time to rescue the animals trapped inside the burning wreckage. The night, once a backdrop to a farmer's routine, had transformed into a night of dire consequence, where every second counted."
"“I went to Brown and graduated cum laude, but mostly I lied and cheated my way through. I was good at it. And—here’s a big one—the student advisor I had my senior year was a coke addict. I won’t go into","how I found that out, like you said, time’s passing, but I did, and I made a deal with him. Good recommends in exchange for a key of coke. Plus, of course, he’d pay for the dope. I wasn’t into charity.”",82,"completion>to keep me on the good side. He was always high, and I knew if I brought him the right kind of coke, he'd make sure I got all the credits I needed, even if I hadn't done the work. It was a twisted form of bribery, but it worked. I felt terrible about it, but at the time, I was more concerned with getting out of there without anyone finding out. After graduation, I moved to New York City, where I thought no one would care about my past. I got a job in a small marketing firm, and I lied on my resume, claiming experience I didn't have. Luckily, the job didn't require much, and I was able to fake my way through. It wasn't until a few years later, when I was promoted to a position that actually demanded some real work, that I realized I couldn't continue living a lie. I was in over my head, and my lack of skills became painfully obvious. I was fired shortly after, and it was a wake-up call. I had to face the fact that I had no real qualifications or skills. It was a humbling experience, to say the least. I eventually went back to school, this time honestly, and earned a degree in social work. It took years of hard work and rebuilding my life from the ground up, but I finally found a career I was passionate about and where I could make a real difference. It's a far cry from where I started, but I'm proud of the person I've become. I've learned that honesty and hard work are the only ways to build a life worth living."
"It’s a bad dream. Danny’s had a few before, everyone has a nightmare from time to time, but this is the worst one ever. Nothing bad is happening","at first, but that doesn’t help; the sense of impending doom is so strong it’s an actual taste in his mouth, like sucking on a clump of pennies.",56,"he has ever experienced. The room around him is dark, oppressive, and the air feels thick, almost suffocating. He tries to scream, to call out for help, but no sound escapes his mouth. His body feels heavy, like it's made of lead, and he's unable to move. Panic rises within him, a cold sweat breaking out on his forehead. He can't wake up, can't escape this nightmare. Suddenly, a shadowy figure looms over him, its features indistinct, almost ghostly. Danny's heart pounds in his chest, fear gripping him tightly. The figure leans in close, whispering words that he can't understand, but the tone is menacing, filled with malice. He feels a cold shiver run down his spine as the figure's presence fills the room with an overwhelming sense of dread and malevolence. Danny's mind races, trying to make sense of the situation, to find a way out, but the fear paralyzes him completely. He's trapped in this nightmare, unable to wake up or escape the terror that grips him."
He’s walking along the shoulder of a dirt road that’s been packed and oiled to keep the dust down. It’s night. A quarter moon has just risen. To Danny it looks like a sideways grin. Or a sneer. He passes a sign reading,"COUNTY ROAD F, only the O and the Y have been spraypainted over, and UCK has been crammed in to the right of the F, so the sign now reads CUNT ROAD FUCK. There are a couple of bullet holes for good measure.",86,"“No Trespassing” in faded white letters. The sign is old, the paint peeling, and it sways slightly in the breeze. Danny glances at it, his hand instinctively gripping the pocket knife he’s been carrying since he left town. The road stretches ahead, deserted and silent except for the occasional crunch of gravel under his boots. He’s been walking for hours, ever since the sun dipped below the horizon, and the cool night air has replaced the day’s oppressive heat. The moonlight casts long shadows, making the landscape seem both familiar and alien. Danny’s thoughts are a mix of worry and determination; he’s on a mission, one that he can’t afford to fail. His family’s future depends on it. He quickens his pace, the urgency of his mission propelling him forward. The dirt road, though rough, is a clear path to his destination, a small cabin hidden deep in the woods that he hopes will provide the answers he seeks. As he walks, the sounds of the night grow louder—the distant hoot of an owl, the rustle of small animals in the underbrush, and the soft whisper of the wind through the trees. Danny’s senses are heightened, aware of every sound and shadow. He knows he’s not alone out here, not with the kind of secrets he’s carrying. But he’s determined to press on, to face whatever comes his way. The journey ahead is fraught with danger, but Danny is resolute. He’s done with running from his past, and now, under the watchful gaze of the moon, he’s ready to confront it."
"There’s corn on both sides of the road, not as high as an elephant’s eye but maybe four feet, suggesting it’s early summer. County Road F runs dead straight up a mild rise (in Kansas most rises are mild). At the top is a black bulk of a building that fills Danny with unreasoning horror. Some","tin thing is going tinka-tinka-tinka. He wants to stop, wants nothing to do with that square black bulk, but his legs carry him on. There’s no stopping them. He’s not in control. A breeze gives the corn a bonelike rattle. It’s chilly on his cheeks and forehead and he realizes he’s sweating. Sweating in a dream!",112,"Continuing the passage, Danny's heart pounds in his chest, a mix of fear and confusion clouding his thoughts. He slows the truck, the engine's growl lessening as he approaches the imposing structure. It's an old grain elevator, its paint peeling to reveal the weathered wood beneath, a relic of a bygone era. The structure looms larger as he draws closer, its presence almost tangible in the open landscape. The air around it seems still, as if holding its breath, and Danny feels a shiver run down his spine. He can't shake the feeling that he's intruding on something sacred, a place out of time. The grain elevator, with its rusted silos and abandoned equipment, stands as a silent sentinel, watching over the endless fields of corn. The sun begins its descent, casting long shadows that stretch out from the building, elongating its already imposing figure. Danny's hand trembles slightly on the steering wheel, his instincts screaming for him to turn around, to flee from this place that feels so out of place in the vast, open Kansas landscape. Yet, curiosity, or perhaps a sense of duty, keeps him moving forward. He pulls the truck to a stop in front of the grain elevator, the engine ticking as it cools. The silence is deafening, broken only by the distant call of a bird. Danny steps out, the ground beneath his feet solid and unforgiving. He takes a deep breath, steeling himself for whatever lies ahead, unsure if he's about to uncover a mystery or confront a nightmare."
"Nothing here to worry about, Danny thinks, nothing here to be afraid",of. And he’s not worried. He’s not afraid. Terrified is what he is.,25,"of the dark alley he's about to enter, the chill in the air doing little to calm his racing heart"
"Tinka-tinka-tinka go the signs advertising long-gone gas prices. The big office window is broken, ditto the glass in the door, but Danny can see weeds growing up","around the shards reflecting the moonlight and knows that it’s been awhile since they were broken. The vandals—bored country kids, most likely—have had their fun and moved on.",55,"through the cracks in the wall. Inside, the lobby is deserted, the reception desk overrun with dust and papers, a silent witness to the passage of time. The once bustling gas station, a beacon for travelers on Route 66, now stands as a relic, its vibrant signs echoing the past with their rhythmic tinkle, a ghostly reminder of the days when it was a hub of activity. Danny, with a sense of melancholy, wonders about the people who once worked here, the lives that were touched by this place, and the stories that remain untold, swallowed by the silence of abandonment."
"Danny moves on, too. Around the side of the abandoned station. Doesn’t want to;",has to. He’s not in control. Now he hears something else: scratching and panting.,28,"Danny feels a pull towards the past, a haunting reminder of what once was. Despite his reluctance, he steps forward, driven by a mix of curiosity and a sense of duty to confront the ghosts of his former life."
"He goes around the side, kicking a couple of empty motor oil cans (Havoline, the Texaco brand) out of his way. There’s a rusty metal trash barrel, overturned and spilling more cans and Coors bottles and whatever paper trash hasn’t blown away.","Behind the station there’s a mangy mongrel dog digging at the oil-stained earth. It hears Danny and looks around, its eyes silver circles in the moonlight. It wrinkles back its snout and gives a growl that can mean only one thing: mine, mine.",85,"As he approaches the barrel, he notices a pair of old work boots peeking out from underneath. They're worn, the leather cracked and stained, suggesting they've seen better days. He bends down, lifting one boot to inspect it closer. The boot smells musty, a mix of damp earth and mildew. It's clear they haven't been worn in a while. He sets the boot down and peers into the barrel, his eyes adjusting to the dim light filtering through the rust. Inside, amidst the clutter of cans and bottles, he spots a few crumpled bills - some still in relatively good condition. Curiosity piqued, he reaches in, careful not to cut himself on the sharp edges of the metal, and retrieves the money. Flattening the bills out, he sees they total to about twenty dollars. He wonders who they belonged to and why they were discarded here, in such a desolate place. A thought crosses his mind - should he keep the money, or is there a way to find the rightful owner? He debates the moral dilemma for a moment, his hand hovering over the cash, before ultimately deciding to take a chance. He pockets the money, resolving to return later with a proper tool to salvage anything else of value from the trash without causing further damage. With a final glance at the barrel, now slightly less full, he turns and continues on his way, his mind racing with the implications of his discovery."
"The dog lowers its haunches as if to spring, but Danny’s not afraid (not of the mutt, anyway). He’s a town man these days, but he grew up in rural Colorado where there were dogs everywhere and he knows an empty threat when he faces one. He bends and picks up an empty oil can,","the dream so real, so detailed, he can feel the scrim of leftover grease down the side. He doesn’t even have to throw it; raising it is enough. The dog turns tail and leaves at a limping run—either something wrong with one of its back legs or a split pad on one of its paws.",110,
The student and faculty parking lots of Wilder High are almost completely empty because school let out some weeks earlier. Danny goes around back and parks,"in the usual place, at the end of the school bus line. There’s no sign saying it’s reserved for the head custodian, but everyone knows it’s his.",53,"behind the school, hoping no one will notice the unauthorized vehicle. He steps out of his car, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows across the deserted parking lot, and pulls out his phone to call his friend, Mike, who promised to meet him here. As he waits, Danny glances around nervously, his mind racing with the plan they had concocted. He needed to make sure everything was in place before Mike arrived, but more than that, he needed to convince himself that this was the right thing to do. After all, pulling off a stunt like this wasn't going to be easy, especially with the school administration known for their strict rules and even stricter enforcement. Danny's heart pounded in his chest, a mix of excitement and anxiety swirling within him as he stood there, alone with his thoughts and the quiet hum of the empty parking lot."
"This is his favorite time of year, when you can do work and it stays done… at least for awhile. A waxed hallway floor will still shine a week from now, even two weeks. You can scrape the gum off the floors in the boys’ and","girls’ locker rooms (the girls are the worst offenders when it comes to gum, he doesn’t know why) and not have to do it again until August. Freshly washed windows don’t pick up adolescent fingerprints. As far as Danny’s concerned, summer vacation is a beautiful thing.",92,"girls' restrooms, and the shine will remain. The floors are easy to clean and maintain, providing a hygienic and welcoming environment for everyone who walks through the school's corridors. The boys, in particular, seem to have a knack for finding gum and dropping it on the floor, but with a quick scrape, the area looks pristine again. This routine maintenance not only keeps the school looking its best but also instills a sense of pride and responsibility among the students. They see the effort put into maintaining their space, and it encourages them to take care of their surroundings. Moreover, the consistent shine of the floor acts as a visual cue to the students and staff that the school is well-cared for and valued. This attention to detail in housekeeping contributes to the overall atmosphere of the school, making it a more pleasant and productive place for learning and growth."

Apply the wax according to the manufacturer's instructions, starting from the back of the room and working your way towards the door. Allow the wax to dry completely before moving on to the next section. Once the wax has set, buff the area with a clean cloth to achieve a smooth, polished finish. Repeat this process for each room in the new wing, ensuring consistency and quality throughout."
"He pushes the button, and a second later he’s looking at a gray cinderblock building. In this photo it’s new instead of old and the Texaco sign is spandy clean. The glass in the office window and door is intact. The gas pumps sparkle. The prices on the signs say it’s $1.09 for regular and $1.21 for mid-grade. There","was apparently no hi-test to be had at Hilltop Texaco when the picture was taken, which must have been a long time ago. The car at the pumps is a boat of a Buick and the road out front is two-lane blacktop instead of oiled dirt. Danny thinks the Buick must have rolled off the line in Detroit around 1980.",119,
"Danny looks at this dream-made-real with a dismay so deep it’s almost fear. Hell, maybe it is fear. All he wanted was to make sure Hilltop Texaco (and","the hand sticking out of the ground, don’t forget the hand) was just some bullshit his sleeping mind created, and now look at this. Just look at it.",56,"his family) would be safe from the encroaching darkness of corporate greed and environmental neglect. Now, standing in the middle of this surreal, sprawling gas station empire, he wonders if he has traded one kind of nightmare for another. The pumps are humming, the cash registers are ringing, but the silence is deafening. There's no laughter of children playing in the parking lot, no smell of freshly baked pies from the diner, no warmth of community gatherings. Instead, there's an eerie emptiness, a hollow victory that feels more like defeat. Danny's heart sinks as he realizes that in his quest to protect, he might have inadvertently destroyed the very essence of what he was trying to preserve. The dream-made-real is a hollow shell, a monument to ambition gone awry, and Danny wonders if he'll ever find his way back to the simplicity and sincerity of the small-town life he left behind."
"Danny grins. “Anyone who steals from it, good luck and welcome to what they get. Plus the",truck itself has eaten her share of road. Got almost two hundred thousand miles on the clock.”,34,extra punishment we have planned for them.” His words send a chill down the spine of those who might consider the museum's riches as an easy target.
"They talk a little bit, this and that, people they know, her mother’s glaucoma and how Danny’s brother is doing at his job (fabulous), and then","he asks if they ever drove north, maybe over into Nebraska, maybe to Franklin or Beaver City. Didn’t they have lunch one time in Beaver City?",52,"they settle into a comfortable silence, the kind that speaks volumes without a single word. The night air is cool against their skin, the stars twinkling with a promise of adventures yet to unfold. She leans her head on his shoulder, feeling the warmth of his presence, and for a fleeting moment, everything seems perfect. In the distance, the faint sound of crickets fills the air, a natural symphony that complements the quietude of the moment. They sit there, two souls intertwined, basking in the serenity of the night, unaware of the challenges that await them but confident in the strength of their bond. The world seems to pause around them, allowing them a rare glimpse into the beauty of simply being together."
"Danny says he would. She asks if he’s taking care of himself, meaning is he still off the booze. Danny","says he is, tells her to look both ways before crossing the street (an old joke between them), and hangs up.",41,"claims he has been, focusing on his health and trying to get his life back on track, although he admits it hasn't been easy. He mentions the support from his family and friends, who have been checking in on him regularly, which gives him a sense of responsibility to not let them down. She smiles, relieved, and suggests they meet up soon to celebrate his progress, to which Danny enthusiastically agrees, feeling a renewed sense of hope and purpose."
"Danny has been to Lincoln a couple of times and Omaha once, but those towns are east of Wilder, and Gunnel is dead north. Yet he must have been","there and just forgot it. Maybe back in his drinking days? Except he never drove when he was out-and-out shitfaced, afraid of losing his license or maybe hurting somebody.",58,"to Wilder several times, navigating the winding roads that lead through the dense forests and across the occasional river. Each trip was for work, delivering supplies to the small logging camps scattered throughout the region. Despite the repetitive nature of his journeys, the changing seasons painted the landscape in vibrant hues, from the lush, green canopy of spring to the fiery tapestry of autumn leaves. The crisp air of fall was his favorite, carrying the scent of burning leaves and the promise of warmer days ahead. As he drove, the radio would play a mix of country tunes and local news, keeping him company and informed about the latest happenings in the area. Sometimes, if he was lucky, he'd spot a moose by the roadside, its majestic presence a reminder of the wild untouched beauty of the Pacific Northwest. Each trip, though routine, held the potential for a new discovery or an unexpected encounter, making the drives a part of his daily life that he looked forward to."
On Saturday morning he packs his dinnerbucket with a couple of sandwiches and a piece of the cake Becky brought over after he wired up the tailpipe of her old Honda Civic. He fills his Thermos,"with black coffee and heads north. He thinks he’ll feel like eating if he takes a look behind that deserted gas station and finds nothing. If he sees what he saw in his dream, probably not.",72,"with coffee, hops on his bike, and pedals down the street towards the construction site where he's been working since dawn. The sun is just beginning to crest the buildings, casting long shadows that dance alongside him as he rides. Construction noise greets him, a familiar symphony that he's grown accustomed to. He parks his bike by the site's entrance, takes a deep breath, and heads towards the foreman's office to clock in for the day's work. As he walks, he thinks about Becky, wondering if she'll remember to water the plants he left on her windowsill. He hopes the cake was as delicious as it looked, a small reward for his efforts with her car. Work awaits, but first, he needs to grab his hard hat and safety goggles, tools of the trade that protect him from the hazards of the day. The day promises to be long and demanding, but he's ready. He's been building and fixing things his whole life; this is just another challenge to overcome."
"The GPS on his phone gets him to Gunnel by ten-thirty. The day is all Kansas, hot and bright and clear and not very interesting. The town is nothing but a grocery store, a farm supply store, a café, and a rusty water tower with GUNNEL","on the side. Ten minutes after leaving it, he comes to County Road F and turns onto it. It’s tar, not packed dirt. Nevertheless his stomach is tight and his heart is beating hard enough so he can feel it in his neck and his temples.",92,"of the name, standing like a faded monument to a forgotten past. As he steps out of his car, the heat hits him like a wall, a tangible force that seems to press down on his shoulders. He wipes the sweat from his brow and takes a deep breath, steeling himself for the task ahead. The grocery store is the first stop, its faded sign swinging lazily in the breeze. Inside, the air conditioning is a shock to the system, a cold embrace that makes his skin prickle. The aisles are lined with products that seem to stretch on endlessly, each one a potential clue or red herring. He moves methodically, checking labels and prices, his mind constantly analyzing and categorizing. The farm supply store is next, a place that smells of hay and diesel. Here, he's looking for something specific, a particular brand of feed that's rare in these parts. The clerk, a weathered man with a slow drawl, eyes him curiously as he browses. ""Need help with something?"" he asks, leaning against the counter. ""Just looking,"" he replies, though he's anything but. The café is a reprieve, a cool, dimly lit sanctuary from the relentless sun. He orders a coffee and a sandwich, taking a seat by the window to watch the world go by. The townspeople pass by, their faces familiar yet inscrutable. They nod at him, acknowledging his presence, but their eyes hold secrets he can't quite grasp. As he sips his coffee, he wonders if any of them know more than they're letting on. The water tower looms in the distance, a constant reminder of Gunnel's identity. He takes a last look at the town, his mind racing with possibilities. The heat is oppressive, but it's nothing compared to the weight of expectation pressing down on him. He knows he has to act fast; time is a luxury he doesn't have. With a deep breath, he climbs back into his car, the engine roaring to life as he heads towards the heart of the mystery that Gunnel holds."
"Danny pulls onto the cracked and weed-sprouting tarmac, careful to stay clear of the busted glass. His tires aren’t new, and the spare is",so bald it’s showing cord in a couple of places. The last thing he wants—the last thing in the world—is to be stranded out here.,49,"spare is questionable at best, having seen better days. The sun beats down mercilessly on the decrepit road, casting long shadows from the dilapidated buildings lining the side of the street. Danny grips the steering wheel tightly, his eyes scanning for any signs of life or danger. The town ahead looks like it's been forgotten by time, with rusted cars parked haphazardly and windows boarded up. He slows down, wary of the unknown, and wonders if this is the right place to turn around or if he should press on, despite the risks."
"He gets out of his truck, slams the door, and jumps at the sound it makes. Stupid, but he can’t help it. He’s pretty well scared to death.","Somewhere in the distance, a tractor is blatting. It might as well be on another planet, as far as Danny’s concerned. He can’t remember ever feeling this utterly alone.",57,"His heart pounds in his chest, each beat echoing in his ears louder than the slam of the truck door. He's never been one for fright, but the stories they say about this place, about what lurks in the shadows, have gotten to him. He takes a deep breath, trying to muster courage, and steps forward onto the dusty road, his boots kicking up small clouds of red dirt. The sun is setting, casting long, eerie shadows that seem to stretch and twist, as if alive. He knows he should turn back, return to the safety of his truck, but an inexplicable pull keeps him moving forward, driven by a mix of fear and curiosity. He scans the horizon, half-expecting to see something, anything, that might explain the rumors. The wind picks up, whispering through the trees, carrying with it the faintest echo of a laugh, chilling him to the bone. He shakes his head, trying to dispel the notion, but the sound lingers, a harbinger of what might be waiting in the darkness ahead."
"“Fuck off!” Danny yells, and claps his hands. The dog",gives him a baleful look and limps away into the corn.,21,"snaps at him, startled by the sudden noise, then retreats back to its owner's side, tail tucked between its legs."
"“Yup, yup. On the other hand, you paid cash for it,” Jalbert says, as if just passing the time. “That was","smart. Without the security camera video, we might have taken quite awhile to find you. Might not have found you at all.”",43,"the smart move,” he adds, leaning back in his chair, his eyes never leaving the road ahead. ""Cash is king,"" he continues, ""no strings attached, no interest to worry about, just you and the car, free and clear."" His words carry a weight of experience, a lesson learned the hard way perhaps, but now shared with an almost fatherly tone. ""You made a good choice,"" he concludes, a hint of pride in his voice, as if the decision to pay cash was not just a financial strategy but a statement of independence and freedom."
“Just this one time!” Jalbert is trying to sound amazed. His eyes aren’t,amazed. They crawl back and forth across Danny’s face. They almost have weight. “One!”,27,"reflecting the excitement he claims to feel; instead, they reveal a hint of desperation. He's been asked to do this favor countless times before, each time swearing it would be the last, yet here he stands, once again ensnared in a web of obligation and guilt. His friend, sensing the underlying tension, tries to lighten the mood with a joke, but the laughter feels forced, echoing through the room like the hollow promise of a man on the brink of another compromise."
Jalbert continues to shake his head. “No… no… we need,to clear him. We need to clear this one-time-only psychic janitor.”,21,"to reconsider our strategy. The situation is more complicated than we initially thought, and we must approach it with a more careful plan to ensure our success and safety,"" Jalbert insists, his voice laced with a mix of frustration and determination."

"For the first time Jalbert’s smile looks real. In a low, almost caressing voice, he says,",“I think you did. I know you did. Sure you don’t want to talk about it?”,32," ""I've finally found someone who understands me, who sees beyond the mask I wear."" His eyes, searching hers for a sign of comprehension, held a depth that seemed to reach into the very soul. ""You're the first person to ever make me feel truly seen."" His words, though soft, carried a weight that lingered in the air, leaving a silence that felt both heavy and comforting. ""Will you stay and talk to me?"" he asked, a hint of hope lacing his tone. ""I'd like to learn more about you, to understand how you managed to break through the walls I've built around myself."" His request was genuine, a plea for connection in a world where he'd long since given up on finding it. "
"“Good luck getting someone to okay paying that,” Jalbert says. “Bureaucracy.”","The pegs of his teeth wink, then disappear. “But you can try.”",23,"Continuing the passage might involve highlighting the challenges of convincing higher-ups to approve a costly project, emphasizing the red tape and bureaucratic hurdles that often slow down decision-making processes in large organizations. This could lead to a description of how individuals like Jalbert might navigate these obstacles, perhaps by building a strong case with data and presenting it to the right decision-makers at the right time, or by forming alliances with influential colleagues who can advocate for the project's approval."
She and Jalbert get into the dark blue sedan. They drive toward,"the trailer park entrance, past the sign reading SLOW WE LOVE OUR CHILDREN.",25,"Montreal, hoping to find answers about her husband's disappearance. The night air is cool against the windows, and the city lights begin to twinkle as they move further away from the familiar streets of their neighborhood. She wonders if they will ever find peace or if the mystery will haunt them forever, casting long shadows in the path of their lives. Jalbert remains silent, his thoughts as dark as the night, his hands tightly gripping the steering wheel. The road stretches ahead, an endless ribbon of possibility and uncertainty."
"She heads out. Jalbert gives her a wave and then heads to his room, giving his Chevy Caprice a pat on the way by. Like","his briefcase, the Caprice has been with him on many cases from Kansas City on one side of the state to Scott City on the other.",51,"he did every day, he checks the rearview mirror to ensure no one is following, a habit ingrained from years of undercover work. He slides the key into the ignition, the engine roars to life, a comforting sound that has always signaled the start of another day. He pulls out of the driveway, the tires gripping the pavement with a familiar screech, and merges onto the street. The morning air is crisp, carrying the scent of dew and the promise of a new day. As he drives, he ponders over the case he's about to dive into, mentally preparing himself for the complexities it might hold. His mind, trained to analyze and anticipate, sifts through the scant information he has, trying to piece together the puzzle that is his current assignment. The city begins to wake up around him, the streets slowly filling with the daily commuters, each with their own stories and destinations. He drives past familiar landmarks, each one a silent witness to his past endeavors. The Caprice, a reliable companion through thick and thin, cruises along, its presence a reminder of the countless miles and mysteries he's navigated. As he approaches the highway, he checks his mirrors once more, ensuring he's alone before accelerating onto the open road. The open highway beckons with its endless possibilities, and he embraces the solitude, knowing it's a necessary part of his job. The hum of the engine is his only companion as he merges with the flow of traffic, heading towards the city's heart where the real work awaits."
"The two-room suite, far from fancy, is what’s known as “Kansas plain.” There’s a smell of disinfectant and a fainter smell of mold.

Jalbert drops his briefcase on the","bed and runs the combination lock. He takes out a file with WICKER written on the tab. He makes sure the curtains are pulled tight.

He sits in the chair by the door.",129,"single bed that looks like it's seen better days, its springs creaking a lullaby of worn-out sleep. The wallpaper, a faded floral pattern, peels at the corners, revealing the gray wall behind. The room is lit by a bulb that flickers intermittently, casting a stuttering shadow on the threadbare carpet. A small, dusty desk sits against the wall, cluttered with papers and an ancient computer that whirs to life with a start. The window, covered by a thin curtain, reveals a view of the parking lot, where a few cars sit under the indifferent sun. Outside, the hum of distant traffic mixes with the occasional cry of a distant bird. He sighs, settling into the uncomfortable chair across from the bed, his mind already racing through the day’s tasks. He’s not one to complain; he’s here to work, after all. The clatter of the old metal faucet echoes through the room as he washes his hands, the water running cold before warming up slightly. He dries them on a towel that smells faintly of mildew. The clock on the bedside table ticks loudly, each second a reminder of the time slipping away. He glances at the door, wondering when the next meal will come – if it comes at all. For now, he’s alone with his thoughts and the persistent sounds of the room, a temporary home in a city that never sleeps, but perhaps its accommodations do."
"“Of course, but this is a serious matter,” Ball says, still pleasant. “If it takes all day, that’s what it will take. I have a right to speak with my client before you question him.","If you’re with KBI, you know this.

He turns away, unable to look at her directly, his hands clenched into fists at his sides. The air between them feels charged, heavy with unspoken resentment and the weight of their unresolved conflict. She stands there, shocked by his sudden outburst, her heart pounding in her chest, unsure of what to say or do next. The silence stretches on, uncomfortable and thick, until finally she finds the courage to speak, hoping to mend the rift that has formed."
"“No clue,” Jesse says. “I work with him here, otherwise we don’t hang.","Maybe he thought because the 4th is tomorrow, we had today off, too.”",26,"He's a bit of a mystery, keeps to himself mostly, but he's been reliable when it counts."

Her voice is steady, but her heart races with a mix of anger and disappointment. She's not just defending Frank; she's asserting her own boundaries and values. The confrontation is tense, but necessary, and she's determined to see it through, no matter how uncomfortable it makes her feel. She believes that understanding the truth is the first step toward healing and moving forward, for both of them."
"“I’ll let you do your thinking,” Calten says, “but listen—if","I could do anything to help, I know it’s unlikely…”",20,"you ever cross me again, it'll be the last thing you ever do.” His voice is cold, leaving no room for argument, as he turns on his heel and strides away, leaving a heavy silence in his wake."
"“A cop.” Andersson pauses for a moment, then blurts, “At least he said he was a cop, and I believed him because he","really had the inside track on the investigation. He said printing the guy’s name would put pressure on him to, you know, come clean.”",47,"he had the uniform and the badge, and his demeanor seemed professional. I didn't think to question it further, which was a mistake. Later, when things went south, I realized he might not have been who he claimed to be. The implications were staggering; if he was an imposter, it meant I'd been played, and the safety of the community could be at risk. The incident shook me to my core, making me question my judgment and the trust I placed in others. It was a harsh lesson in vigilance and the importance of verifying information before acting on it."
“In a safe place.” That last question is a tiny bit frightening. She doesn’t,"really believe Frank would hurt her, but he’s not right. There’s no question of that.",29,"to know if he truly understands the gravity of the situation they're in. Her heart races with a mix of fear and hope, wondering if this is the moment they've been waiting for, or if it's the beginning of their downfall."
"“Stop with the we stuff, Frank.” Now she just sounds weary. “I didn’t give his name to that free newspaper",and I didn’t plant dope in his truck. You did those things on your own. And I didn’t get him shot.”,41,"and I regret it. They've been calling non-stop, and I'm just tired of dealing with it. I thought it would be a good way to get some attention for him, but it's turned into a nightmare. I wish I had never done it."""
The white-haired man looked interested. He put the sheet of paper back,in the thin folder and closed it. “Not Bobby Feeney? Is that so?”,25,"on the desk, leaned back in his chair, and began to tap his fingers thoughtfully against the armrest, deep in thought about the information he had just read."
“Doc.” The white-haired man—Mr. Ludlum—nodded to the one with the,droopy eye. “Help this fine young man to remember his name.”,21,"stern expression, a badge of authority worn proudly on his square jaw."
Doc gave a brief grunt of what might have been laughter. “If I’d,"wanted you dead, I would have let you eat breakfast. The mushrooms were poisoned.”",27,"known better, I wouldn't be in this mess,” he muttered, shaking his head as he looked at the disheveled room around him."
"“I don’t know if you’re worth a shite to anyone, but you don’t deserve to die just because he is the way he is now. Did you see","that pamphlet he’s so proud of? Wrote it himself, didn’t he? But he wasn’t always that way. No. We did good work once upon a time, didn’t we, Pando?”",57,"what happened to him? It's not your fault, and you shouldn't have to pay for it with your life. There's always hope, even in the darkest of times. Maybe there's someone out there who can help him, who can make a difference. You need to hold on to that hope, for both your sakes. Remember, every person has value, and you deserve a chance to live your life without fear or judgment."
"“Hey, guys! Hello, ma’am!” Galen sounds as cheerful as a day in",July. “Looks like you got a little trouble here. Want a hand?”,24," spring, his smile wide and genuine, reflecting the excitement of the upcoming adventure. He waves energetically, his eyes scanning the crowd for familiar faces, eager to share the day's plans and embark on the journey together."
“I—” His phone rings. He pulls it off his belt and looks at the screen. If the call,"was from his partner, he would decline. But it’s not. It’s from Captain Alvarez. “I have to take this.”",37,"comes from Sarah, he'll answer; if it's from his boss, he might let it go to voicemail, considering the time of day and the potential implications of missing a call."
"“I’m so looking forward to this,” Mary Worth said. “I haven’t had a real vacation in twelve",years. I’m sharing the rent of a little place on Siesta Key with a couple of chums.”,34,"years,” she continued, packing her suitcase with care, making sure not to forget anything essential for her much-needed break. She had been working tirelessly, often neglecting her personal life, and now it was time to unwind and recharge her batteries. Her destination was a small coastal town she had read about in a travel magazine, known for its serene beaches and vibrant local culture. She planned to spend her days exploring the quaint shops, enjoying the fresh seafood, and perhaps taking a few yoga classes to maintain her peace of mind. In the evenings, she hoped to relax on the porch with a good book, listening to the soothing sound of the waves. It was going to be a perfect getaway, a chance to reflect on her life and return to her daily routine with a renewed sense of purpose and happiness."
"“Yes!” Mary Worth twinkled. “We have it for three weeks. We’ve never actually met, but they are true chums. We’re all widows.","We met in a chat room on the Internet. It’s so wonderful, the Internet. There was nothing like it when I was young.”",45,"Our children are grown, and we've found solace in each other's company. We share stories of our late husbands, laugh over our grandchildren's antics, and support one another through life's challenges. It's a sisterhood that time and distance cannot break. We've even planned a small gathering at my place to celebrate our newfound friendship. It's a precious thing, these connections that life throws our way when we least expect them."""
"“Wow,” Freeman said, and actually laughed. “You are scared. But you know what","they say, cold hands, warm heart.” He tossed off the rest of his drink.",27,"you're not alone. We've got each other's backs, no matter what happens,” Freeman continued, trying to reassure the frightened companion."
"“I don’t want a sausage scramble,” Lloyd said, eyeing the dog. It was sitting on the white shag carpet, and he wondered how long it would be before it left a","calling card there. The carpet needed a good vacuum and probably a shampoo, but at least it had never been peed on. The dog was looking at him with its amber eyes.",63,"stain that would require his mother's attention and possibly a lecture on responsibility. He shifted his gaze to the window, watching the raindrops race down the glass, each one leaving a trail that quickly disappeared. The dog, seemingly unbothered by Lloyd's disinterest, tilted its head, its brown eyes fixed on him with an innocent curiosity. It let out a soft whine, as if asking for a piece of the action, or perhaps just a bit of affection. Lloyd sighed, realizing that despite his initial reluctance, he might end up involved in a morning adventure with the dog, whether he liked it or not. The thought wasn't entirely unwelcome; after all, the dog was his constant companion, a source of both trouble and comfort in his otherwise quiet suburban life."
Beth pointed to the toy-sized leash on the hassock. “Take her out. Introduce,"her to Marian’s overgrown flowerbeds. And by the way, that carpet is filthy.”",26,"her to the other dogs,” Beth instructed, a hint of excitement in her voice. Tim hesitated, unsure about the responsibility but wanting to make his sister happy. He picked up the tiny leash, its material soft and pliable under his fingers. With a deep breath, he opened the door, stepping into the yard where a small, fluffy dog was waiting eagerly. The creature barked happily, sensing a new playmate. Tim knelt down, fastening the leash to the dog's collar, and felt a surge of pride as he stood up, ready to take on this new role. The dog pulled gently, eager to explore, and Tim followed, a smile spreading across his face as he realized he was doing something right, something that made his sister's eyes light up with joy. The morning passed quickly, filled with laughter and the soft sounds of the neighborhood coming to life. As they returned inside, Tim felt a sense of accomplishment, knowing he had successfully completed his sister's request and strengthened their bond in the process."
"The puppy got up and walked toward him. Waddled, actually, as if through high weeds. It sat down again by his left foot, looking up. Lloyd lowered his hand tentatively, expecting a",nip. The dog licked him instead. He got the toy leash and attached it to the puppy’s small pink collar. “Come on. Let’s get you off the damn rug while there’s still time.”,65,"sniff before accepting the contact. The puppy's fur was soft, its eyes bright and curious. It wagged its tail, a clear sign of friendliness. Lloyd smiled, feeling a warmth spread inside him. He decided then and there that this little creature needed a home, and he would be the one to provide it. He stood up, the puppy scrambling to keep up, its tiny paws paddling in the grass. As they walked back towards the house, Lloyd thought about the responsibilities that came with pet ownership but felt a sense of eager anticipation. He knew he'd be a good owner, providing love, care, and a safe environment for the puppy to grow up in. The puppy, now named Buddy by Lloyd, would have a loving family and a secure future."
"According to Greg, you’re the one who’s crazy, I thought.","And judging by the stroller you’re wheeling around, he wasn’t wrong.",21,"He insisted, despite my protests, that I was the one who had lost touch with reality, not him."
"Just be pleasant, Greg told me. She’s harmless, and she makes the best oatmeal raisin cookies I’ve ever tasted. I wasn’t sure I","believed him about the cookies—admen are prone to superlatives, even those who have left the job—but I was perfectly willing to be pleasant.",46,"to understand why he would be so insistent about someone who simply bakes cookies. It wasn't until later that I realized the depth of his kindness and foresight. Greg knew that a simple act of sharing cookies could be a bridge to friendship, and he was right. Those cookies became a symbol of acceptance and warmth in our community, and the woman who made them, Mrs. Jenkins, became a cherished friend to many, including me. Her cookies, once just a treat, evolved into a cherished tradition, all because Greg saw past the ordinary and appreciated the extraordinary in the simple things."
"That made me laugh. Greg Ackerman, older and richer, but still a smartass. When we had the Brite Company’s soft drink account,","he once came to a meeting with a bottle of Brite Cola, with the distinctive long neck, sticking out of his unzipped fly.",45,"he would always try to outdo me with some snarky comment about my youthful exuberance. One time, he said, ""You know, if you were any more green, you'd be a walking salad."" It was his way of saying I was inexperienced, but in a joking manner that somehow didn't sting as much as a direct insult might have. Despite his jabs, Greg was a good mentor, teaching me the ropes of account management and the importance of client relationships. He showed me how to read between the lines of a contract, how to negotiate a better deal, and how to maintain professionalism even when dealing with difficult clients. His sharp wit and business acumen were legendary, and I learned a lot from him, not just about business, but also about life. He taught me that a sharp tongue could be a tool for teaching as much as it could be for teasing. His lessons were often wrapped in humor, but they were never forgotten."

"“How did they kill all those snakes?” I had been to the end of the Key, to that small triangle of shell beach between the","pass and the little crown of greenery which is all that remains of Duma Key, and I just couldn’t picture such a mass of snakes there.",51,"larger islands of Andros and New Providence. It was a mystery, considering the vast number of snakes that had been reported by the early settlers. The snakes, some venomous, posed a significant threat to the new colonists, yet they seemed to have vanished without a trace. Theories abounded: perhaps the snakes had been carried off by storms, or maybe they had been hunted to extinction by the early settlers. However, the most plausible explanation, as I discovered during my research, was that the snakes had simply been outcompeted by other species. The introduction of new animals, such as pigs and goats, had disrupted the delicate balance of the ecosystem, leading to the snakes' decline. Additionally, the transformation of the landscape for agriculture and the construction of roads and buildings had destroyed the snakes' natural habitats. As I stood on that beach, the silence was profound, a stark contrast to the tales of serpentine terror that had once haunted the dreams of the early pioneers."
"They came closer still, and I saw there was a rattlesnake in each of the seats, squirming and coiling. They were bringing me the snakes as a gift, maybe. Or as a punishment. I had","been away when my son died, after all. My reason for going to Boston, trouble with an advertising account, was partly an excuse. I was angry about Donna’s affair. No, furious. I needed to cool down.",71,"my eyes widen in horror and disbelief. I couldn't fathom why anyone would think this was a good idea, let alone a gift. The snakes' scales glistened under the dim light of the room, their eyes fixed on me with an unsettling, unblinking gaze. I imagined the sharp, venomous fangs hidden just beneath their lips, ready to strike at the slightest provocation. My heart raced, a mix of fear and confusion clouding my judgment. I wondered if this was some twisted test, a cruel joke at my expense, or perhaps a bizarre cultural tradition I was unaware of. Regardless, I knew I had to maintain my composure. I couldn't show them my panic; it would only encourage them. I took a deep breath, trying to muster the courage to confront them, to demand an explanation. But before I could utter a word, one of the men reached out and gently touched the snake in the seat next to me. To my astonishment, it didn't strike. Instead, it seemed to recognize its handler, slithering contentedly in his hands. The realization dawned on me slowly - these men weren't my enemies. They were snake handlers, perhaps part of a tribe or community with a deep reverence for these creatures. The snakes, I surmised, were not there to harm me but to demonstrate their handlers' skill and bond with these dangerous reptiles. My initial fear began to dissipate, replaced by a growing sense of awe and respect for the men's expertise and the snakes' beauty. I realized then that my preconceived notions about these creatures and the people who cared for them were entirely wrong. The snakes, once symbols of fear and danger, now stood as a testament to the complexity of life and the importance of understanding and respect for other cultures and living beings. I nodded, a silent acknowledgment of my newfound respect, and prepared to engage with these men, eager to learn from them and perhaps, in time, to earn their trust."
"I said, “It’s a song about a woman who keeps looking for her long-gone lover. Mrs.","Bell liked to push around her twins, although they were also long-gone. They died years ago.”",32,"She wanders through life, haunted by memories, never finding peace,"" I concluded, feeling the weight of the song's melancholy message."
Zane scratched his chin. “She must have been handy. Some women are. Just because you think your,kids are still alive forty years later doesn’t mean you can’t replace a washer or a windowpane.”,34,"man doesn't know how to fix things, doesn't mean he can't,"" he continued, his eyes scanning the room for something that might give him a clue about what had happened there."
"Zane didn’t reply. I didn’t, either, but I thought maybe the kids had liked it. Maybe it had",even lulled them off to sleep after a big day of playing and swimming. Squeak… pause… squeak… pause… squeak…,37,"they had imagined. I hoped it wasn't too weird or anything, but maybe it was just avant-garde enough to intrigue them. I decided to wait until the next day to see if anyone mentioned it, trying to keep my expectations in check."
“That’s it. Although hyenas who rob a deceased person’s house usually do it because they,"read the obituary, and who’s going to write an obituary for Mrs. Bell? She was alone.”",31,"are hungry and the victim is no longer able to defend their property, this particular group seems to have a more sinister motive,"" Dr. Jane Goodall observed, her keen eyes scanning the scene of the unusual crime. ""Their behavior suggests a level of coordination and perhaps even a societal structure we haven't fully understood before. It's as if they're testing their boundaries, pushing the limits of what they can take without immediate repercussions. This could be a significant breakthrough in our understanding of hyena social dynamics and their intelligence."" Her team took notes, the implications of this discovery promising to reshape their perception of hyenas from mere scavengers to complex social beings capable of strategic planning and cooperation. The mystery of the hyena bandits was not just a local curiosity but a key to unlocking the secrets of animal behavior and intelligence in the wild. "
"By the time I got back to the house, I was hungry. No, ravenous. I scrambled up four eggs and toasted another English muffin. Donna would have said my hunger was healthy, life-affirming, a spit in the eye of death, but maybe I was just hungry. Finding a","dead woman at the head of her driveway and waving away the buzzards who wanted to eat her must have burned a lot of calories. I couldn’t get her ruined face out of my mind, but I ate everything on my plate anyway, and this time held it down.",97,"few minutes later, I sat down at the kitchen table, the aroma of the eggs and toasted muffin filling the air. I took a bite, the flavors exploding in my mouth, and felt a wave of satisfaction wash over me. It was simple, yet profoundly satisfying. The world outside seemed to slow down, the noise of daily life fading into a distant hum. In that moment, I realized how much I had missed the quiet moments, the simple pleasures of life. Donna would have been proud, I thought, seeing how I had embraced the essence of living fully, even in the smallest of acts. As I continued to eat, savoring each bite, I made a mental note to cherish these moments more often, to find joy in the ordinary, and to let my hunger guide me towards experiences that nourish the soul as much as they do the body."
It was the shirts. Touching the shirts. And the part about Tad? Those were my own memories intruding on whatever vibe I’d been getting from those shirts. My son finding his way into,"my strange state of seeing wasn’t surprising. He had died at about the same age as the Bell twins, and at close to the same time. Triplets instead of twins. Tragedy calling to tragedy.",67,"the story, trying to piece together the puzzle of his father's past, a past I had kept hidden from him for so long. It was a past filled with music, with dreams of stardom, and with the kind of mistakes that can haunt you forever. As I watched him, his fingers brushing against the fabric, I realized how much of myself I had poured into those shirts. Each one was a chapter, a moment frozen in time, a reminder of who I was and who I aspired to be. Yet, as he looked up, his eyes searching mine for answers, I knew I had to tell him. I had to share the truth of those shirts, the music, and the man who was his father. It was time to bridge the gap between our past and present, to weave our stories together, flaws and all. The shirts, once a symbol of my hidden life, would now serve as a starting point for a new understanding, a foundation for a relationship rebuilt on honesty and trust. As I took a deep breath, ready to open up, I hoped that this revelation would not only help him understand me better but also inspire him to forge his own path, learning from my mistakes and achieving his dreams without the shadows of my past weighing him down."
He chuckled. “Got that right. Just put the stroller back and close the door. Deceased lady’s,keys are at the substation. Andy Pelley will pick em up. You remember who I’m talking about?”,33,"housekeeper found her in the hallway, a look of terror frozen on her face. It seemed like an accident, but something about the scene didn't add up. The door was locked from the inside, and there were no signs of a struggle. The police were baffled, and whispers of a ghostly presence spread through the small town."
Pelley took no chances. He took a mask out of his voluminous shorts and put it on as soon as we were inside. I got him icewater and poured myself more coffee. I thought about donning my own mask,"and decided not to. I wanted him to see my whole face. We sat at the kitchen table. Each time he sipped his water he pulled the mask down, then returned it to its place. The mustache made it bulge.",79,"but decided against it, fearing it might raise suspicion. Instead, I grabbed a newspaper from the rack by the door, pretending to read it while keeping a watchful eye on the street outside. Pelley seemed uneasy, constantly checking his watch and glancing toward the window. His behavior suggested we might not be alone for long, and I prepared myself for any sudden moves. I hoped the icewater would keep us hydrated if we had to make a quick exit, and I mentally went over our escape plan. We needed to stay sharp and stick to the plan to avoid any unnecessary risks."
"“Crazy all over the world,” Pelley said. “Why would you come down here in","the summer, anyway? Most people don’t, unless they’ve got free coupons from Disney World.”",28,"the middle of a pandemic?” he asked. The man, whose name was not disclosed due to privacy concerns, hesitated before replying, “I needed a break from the chaos up there. Here, it’s quiet, and I thought I could find some peace.” Pelley, intrigued by the man's decision, pressed on, “But isn’t it risky, traveling alone during such a time?” The traveler nodded, acknowledging the danger, yet his eyes held a glint of adventure, suggesting that for him, the potential risks were outweighed by the allure of the unknown. “I guess I’m looking for something different, something real,” he confessed, his voice tinged with a mix of excitement and uncertainty. “Life up there is so fast-paced, so artificial. Here, it’s raw, it’s real.” Pelley, understanding the man’s yearning for authenticity, decided to delve deeper, “And what do you plan to do next?” The traveler paused, contemplating his next move in this uncharted territory, both geographically and metaphorically. “I’m not sure yet,” he admitted, “but I feel like this journey, no matter where it leads, will be worth it.”"
Devereaux began to shiver all over like a man suffering a fit of ague. His legs jittered and scissored. His back arched. His midsection rose from the couch and thumped,"down and rose again. His feet tapdanced and he began to make a sound, mump-mump-mump, as if his lips were spitstuck and he was trying to get them open to articulate.",61,"down onto the springs with a loud thud. His hands clenched into tight fists, his knuckles whitening. His breath came in short, ragged gasps, and beads of sweat formed on his forehead. The room around him seemed to spin, the walls tilting and the floor tilting beneath him. His eyes rolled back, and he felt a darkness creeping at the edges of his vision, threatening to engulf him entirely. Despite the encroaching blackness, a single thought fought its way to the forefront of his mind: he needed help, desperately. Devereaux's voice, though barely a whisper, managed to croak out a plea, ""Help me..."""
On Saturday night he sat on the deck overlooking the lake with a quart bottle of Old Tyme ginger ale. He woke up on Sunday morning with no decision,"made, but with no hangover—a plus, but not enough. When he got back to Boston that evening, Sally Ann would be waiting to find out what he had decided.",58,"to continue his journey. The sun was just beginning to rise, casting a golden hue over the tranquil waters. He grabbed his backpack, filled with essentials, and headed towards the shore. The crisp morning air was invigorating, and he felt a sense of adventure pulsating through his veins. As he walked, he contemplated the path ahead, wondering about the new experiences and challenges that awaited him. The lake, with its serene beauty, seemed to whisper secrets of the world beyond, urging him to explore further. He knew that the journey would be fraught with uncertainties, but the prospect of discovery was too enticing to resist. With each step, he felt more connected to the natural world around him, as if the earth itself was cheering him on. His mind was a whirlwind of thoughts, but one thing was clear: he was ready to embrace the unknown and let it shape his destiny."
