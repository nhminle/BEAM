"“I think I’m all set here,” he says, and lol of course he isn’t going","to kiss me. “But if I forgot anything, you can have Jake come pick it up.”",31,"to leave; his indecisiveness is as clear as the morning fog; he fidgets with his hands, glancing around the room, avoiding eye contact with anyone who might be watching"
"Jake: younger brother to West (and only slightly less good-looking) and that type of college friend who knows everything about my life at UCLA but has never met my father, who lives only an hour away.","Jake introduced me to West; now Jake will be my sole remaining connection to West. The thought makes me a little sad, but then I remember I have the couch and T-virus zombies waiting for me inside.",73,"completion Jake often found it amusing how his brother, West, seemed to have this invisible connection to their family despite living across the country. West, with his charming personality and keen interest in everything Jake, had become an integral part of his life at UCLA. It was as if he had a twin who knew all his secrets, yet remained a stranger to his most personal relationships. This peculiar dynamic was a source of endless banter between the brothers, who communicated almost daily through a flurry of texts, videos, and late-night phone calls. Jake's friends often marveled at the bond he shared with his brother, especially considering the geographical divide. They would tease him about needing to introduce West to his father, a man who, despite living just an hour away, remained an enigma to West. Jake always laughed it off, knowing full well that introducing his brother to his father was a task easier said than done. His father, a man of few words and even fewer interests outside of his work, had always been guarded about his personal life. Jake's friends, however, were insistent, seeing it as the perfect opportunity for Jake to bridge the gap between his two worlds. They envisioned a heartwarming family reunion, where West's charm would finally break down the barriers his father had built over the years. Jake, though hesitant, couldn't deny the appeal of such a scenario. It would be a chance to finally bring his two worlds together, to share his life with the one person he hadn't yet introduced to the most important man in his life. Yet, deep down, he harbored doubts about whether his father would welcome this change, whether he was ready to open up to a new chapter in his life. Despite these reservations, Jake knew that the idea of bringing his brother into his world, of finally sharing his most private life with someone so close, was an enticing prospect. It was a chance to grow, to learn, and to strengthen the bonds that held his family together, no matter the distance. So, despite the uncertainty, Jake remained hopeful, envisioning a future where his brother and father would meet, and perhaps, just perhaps, his father would see West not just as an extension of his son but as a new friend, a new family member. This dream of unity and understanding kept Jake motivated, pushing him to find the right moment to make it happen. After all, family is about more than just blood; it's about the connections we choose to make and the effort we put into maintaining them."
"“You, too.” West smiles that eye-crinkling smile again, and","damn, I really wish I’d seen it more. “Bye, Anna.”",19,"turning to leave, his tall frame casting a long shadow across the floor as he exits the room, leaving behind a lingering sense of warmth and camaraderie."
"I feel her attention move from the empty apartment to the side of my face, and when I smile","over at her, her blue eyes are round with worry. “Holy shit, Anna, I had no idea. Are you okay?”",39,"she returns the gesture, her eyes softening, a silent acknowledgment of the bond we share despite the chaos around us. Our connection, forged in moments of vulnerability and strength, remains unbroken, a testament to our resilience and the enduring power of human connection."
"“That is wonderful news, sweetheart! Oh, I’m so thrilled! Why don’t you fly down to John Wayne the night","before, stay at the house, and we’ll all take the plane over together? The flight to Singapore is a bear.”",39,"airport tomorrow morning and surprise him with your arrival?” Her heart fluttered with excitement at the thought of seeing him again so soon. “I think that’s a fantastic idea!” she exclaimed, her voice filled with joy. “I’ll pack right away and make sure I have everything I need for the trip. I want to make sure I look my best when I see him.” She imagined the look of surprise and happiness on his face as she walked into their home, carrying the promise of their renewed love. “I’ll call you first thing in the morning to let you know I’m on my way,” she promised, her mind already racing with plans for the visit. “Oh, and maybe we can have a little picnic on the lawn afterward, just the two of us,” she added, her voice soft with affection. “That sounds perfect,” her mother replied, her own eyes shining with happiness for her daughter’s happiness. “I’ll start preparing some of his favorite foods. It’s going to be a wonderful day.”"
"“Anna?” he says, like he’s not entirely sure, and then does a full top-to-bottom sweep of my body, which recalls the lack of pants.","When he digs his hand into his luscious head of hair, I forget to be embarrassed again, because it all comes back to me.",48,"His eyes widen in realization, and he quickly turns away, a deep flush spreading across his cheeks. ""I'm so sorry,"" he mutters, his voice barely above a whisper, as he stumbles over his words, trying to find a way to fix the awkwardness of the situation. ""I didn't realize... I mean, I thought..."" He trails off, clearly embarrassed, and I can't help but feel a mix of amusement and sympathy for his predicament. ""It's okay,"" I say, trying to ease the tension, ""accidents happen."" I give him a small, reassuring smile, hoping to defuse the awkwardness, and he slowly turns back, his eyes meeting mine with a sheepish expression. ""I'll leave you to get dressed,"" he says, his voice still a bit strained, as he backs towards the door, giving me a polite nod before exiting the room, leaving me alone with my thoughts and the pile of clothes on the floor. The door closes softly behind him, and I let out a breath I didn't realize I'd been holding, shaking my head with a soft chuckle at the absurdity of the situation. It's moments like these that life becomes a series of unexpected turns, each more amusing than the last. Now, to find my pants and pretend this never happened. "
The expression he makes is like the meme of that one kid who smiles and then immediately bursts into tears.,West is staring at me like he’s doomed but must pretend to be happy about it. “Anna. You look… great?”,40,"He always manages to leave everyone around him utterly confused and emotionally exhausted, much like the enigmatic and unpredictable nature of the meme itself."
"Stepping aside, I let him pass, and he pulls up short at what’s on the television screen. Conan is",enthusiastically fucking a witch in a cave. We both clear our throats and look up at the ceiling instead.,38,"standing there, looking bewildered, as the camera zooms in on his shocked expression. The audience erupts into laughter, realizing that he had been tricked into wearing a ridiculous costume, a giant chicken suit, complete with a fake beak and feathers. Conan, ever the good sport, plays along, strutting around the stage, clucking and dancing to the music, much to the delight of the studio audience and viewers at home. His ability to laugh at himself and turn a potentially embarrassing moment into a humorous one showcases his charisma and charm, endearing him even more to his fans. The segment becomes an instant classic, shared widely on social media, highlighting the unexpected and unpredictable nature of live television."
"He adjusts his posture on the sofa, turning slightly to face me. Oh, right. He came here to","ask me for help. I sit up, too, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. Focus, Anna.",37,"discuss the matter of the missing artifact. His expression is serious, a stark contrast to the casual way he lounged moments before. ""I need your help,"" he says, his voice low and urgent, ""it's about something dangerous that's resurfaced."" His eyes, earnest and pleading, lock onto mine, demanding my trust and cooperation. ""We have to find it before it's too late."" The gravity of his words sends a chill down my spine, realizing the potential consequences of this mysterious artifact's reappearance. The room seems to close in, the air thick with the unspoken tension of the impending quest. ""Time is of the essence,"" he emphasizes, his hand gripping the armrest of the sofa tightly, knuckles whitening. ""We can't afford any delays."" His gaze holds mine, searching for a sign of agreement, a hint of the resolve he knows we'll need to face whatever dangers lie ahead. The weight of his plea hangs heavy, compelling me to consider the implications of this unexpected visit and the potential peril it signifies. Despite the uncertainty and the looming threat, there's a sense of inevitability, a pull towards the adventure that awaits beyond the confines of this living room. The decision to embark on this journey, fraught with unknowns and risks, looms large, yet the promise of discovery and the chance to make a difference in the face of danger ignites a spark of determination within me. ""Tell me everything,"" I say, my voice steady, ready to step into the fray alongside him, whatever it may hold. The adventure begins, not with a bang, but with a quiet, resolute commitment to face the darkness head-on, side by side. "
"“I knew what Jake ordered for lunch and what kinds of stupid movies would make him laugh, and I could predict all his pickup lines","at parties, but we didn’t ever, like, sit down and do backstory. He didn’t even mention he had a brother until he suggested I marry you.”",51,"because he was as predictable as the sunrise, always showing up when the night ended and the first light of dawn crept over the horizon. His routines were his chains, and I knew them all too well. Whether it was his favorite burger with extra cheese and crispy fries or a cheesy comedy about aliens trying to conquer Earth, I had seen it all before. His attempts at flirting were as rehearsed as a bad sitcom script, yet there was something endearing about his predictability. Every time he'd say, ""Do you believe in love at first sight, or do I need to walk by again?"" I would roll my eyes but secretly smile, knowing that despite his lack of originality, Jake was a constant in a world full of variables."
"“I definitely need to go back to the beginning,” I say, wiping my eyes. I mime an explosion at my temples. “Like—my mind is blown right now. You dressed like a middle schooler around the house. All basketball shorts, all the time. You drove a Honda! West, you’re incognito rich!","No wonder Jake never told me anything about his family! I would have made him pay for Jersey Mike’s every fucking time! Wait. Why did you need to live on campus? If you’re the grandson of the founder of Weston’s, you could probably buy an entire apartment building on Sunset.”",100,"My face must have been a picture, a mix of confusion and disbelief. ""Rich?"" I echo, trying to piece together the puzzle of West's revelation. ""But why go incognito? And a Honda? That's like driving a basic model in a world full of luxury cars. It doesn't add up, West. You always had everything you needed, and yet you chose... simplicity?"" I shake my head, a chuckle escaping despite the situation. ""And the clothes? It's like you were hiding in plain sight, choosing comfort over fashion. It's endearing, in a weird way. Makes me wonder what else I've missed about you, about us."" I lean back, hands rubbing my temples, trying to process the new information. ""So, what now? Do we dive into your secret life? Or do we start fresh, with you being... well, you, without any disguises?"" My voice is a mix of curiosity and a hint of playfulness, trying to lighten the mood. ""And hey, if you've got a closet full of hidden designer threads now, I won't tell a soul. Deal?"" I extend my hand, a half-serious offer, smiling at the thought of West's secret life finally coming to light, in pieces or all at once."
"That lands in a puddle of silence, and it hits me after a couple of seconds filled only",with the sound of Conan kicking someone’s ass on TV that West expects me to catch his meaning.,36,"with the weight of an unspoken truth. I realize then, that the silence wasn't empty but heavy with the echoes of words left unsaid, of promises broken, and of a future that never came to be."
“Correct.” He looks down to his lap. “Only Jake knew the real situation. The rest of my family was disappointed that,"I didn’t let them throw me a big wedding, but I guess they weren’t all that surprised. I’ve always been private.”",42,"their plans for my future didn't work out as expected. I felt a heavy weight on my shoulders, the responsibility of keeping a secret that seemed to grow heavier with each passing day. The trust Jake had in me was immense, and I couldn't let him down. I knew I had to find a way to alleviate the burden, perhaps by slowly revealing the truth to my family, but in a way that wouldn't shatter their dreams or our relationships. It was a delicate balance, and I wasn't sure how to proceed, but I was determined to protect Jake's trust and honor his confidence."
"He looks me over again, top to bottom, and the defeat in his eyes makes me realize the true extent of my unshowered, feral chaos. “Actually,","Anna,” he says, “I need you to come with me to my sister’s wedding in Indonesia and convincingly play the part of my very loving wife.”",52,"it's not just the smell,” he says, pointing at my tangled, dirt-streaked hair, “it's the whole package. You look like you've been living in a cave.” His words sting, but there's a hint of concern behind his sarcastic tone. “You need to clean up, seriously. People will start thinking you're some kind of wild man.”"
"It’s surreal to be here with her after all this time. I was so close to being done with this, so near to the finish line, yet here I am, having to improvise an intricate plan B at the eleventh hour with a Muppet in human form as my co-conspirator. Don’t get me wrong, beneath the baked, unshowered disarray, Anna is still a beautiful woman, with enormous brown eyes, creamy skin, and long, willowy limbs. I’d always been fascinated with the perfect beauty mark just above her lip. Unfortunately, right now she looks like","she’s fallen out of a tree and crawled through a field of tangly briers to get back to her apartment. This is probably the closest I’ve ever seen to her natural hair color because the pink has grown out a good inch, leaving a stripe of brown at her roots. Her makeup is, I presume, from yesterday; shadows of mascara carve dark circles beneath her eyes. Despite the old makeup and frazzled appearance, there’s still something striking about her. Her eyes are enormous and bright, framed with dark lashes, her steady gaze entirely without artifice.",189,
"Though I am nearly certain her mind has wandered to something other than the topic at hand, I let her stare at the wall",a little longer so I can stare at her and reconcile this version of Anna with the one I lived with for two years.,48,"for a few more moments, hoping she will eventually share her thoughts. I maintain a respectful silence, giving her the space she needs to gather her words, aware that sometimes the act of speaking requires a moment to prepare, even if the silence feels heavy with unspoken words. My patience is a quiet anchor, allowing the room to fill with the potential of her forthcoming revelation, trusting that when she speaks, it will be worth the wait."
"As roommates, we didn’t know each other well—that much is probably obvious—but there is an intimacy to sharing a space with someone, a certain kind of kinship that comes with daily proximity. Anna was reasonably tidy and paid her half of the rent when it was due, but she’d never struck me as the organized, driven, premed type. The one time we talked about it, she","said something about medicine being the most palatable of the “real job” options, but she seemed overwhelmed a lot, studying late into the night and painting to decompress in what little free time she had. That she ultimately switched her major to fine art makes a certain amount of sense, but I want to punch myself for not realizing she wasn’t studying medicine at all anymore.",132,
"Anna squints at me. “You said ‘small,’ but I think you meant","‘private.’ Your sister is getting married on a private island, isn’t she?”",24,large.’ Her tone suggests she's not amused by my mistake.
"“Yes.” I work to not let my gaze do another sweep of her apartment. I’ve never been to Pulau Jingga, but my mom has been sending me info that I’ve mostly ignored for months. I know the basic idea—a luxury resort and conservation area set in the Indonesian archipelago—and it’s about","as far from this dark, cramped living room as I can imagine. Right now, I need Anna to believe she can do this. Yes, she may be at rock bottom, but I need her to think she is just one fairy godmother moment away from sliding gracefully into the world she’s imagining.",103,
"Anna looks down at herself and I follow her attention to the front of her shirt, where a Froot Loop adheres to the cotton over her left breast.",She plucks it off and pops it into her mouth. “Why not just find someone who can pretend to be me and who knows how to behave around societay?”,57,"Realizing the absurdity of the situation, Anna tries to flick the cereal off, but it sticks stubbornly, leaving a colorful mark on her shirt. I offer her a handkerchief to cover herself, feeling a mix of embarrassment and amusement at the bizarre occurrence. She accepts it with a sheepish smile, her cheeks flushing a deep crimson. We both know this is a moment neither of us will forget, a humorous anecdote waiting to be shared with friends, albeit with a bit of hesitation due to its unusual nature."
“I have the one of you and Jake hiking the Hills in a frame in my living room. It,"looks enough like me from the back.” I pause, scratching my jaw. “And… I’ve had a few others digitally photoshopped.”",39,"captures the moment perfectly, reminding me of our laughter and the beautiful scenery. Every time I look at it, I am transported back to that day, feeling the joy and freedom we experienced."
"“That it’s small, upturned. She described it as ‘the nose Jenny Nelson",wanted and didn’t get.’ She’d notice if it was someone else’s nose.”,24,"of a clown’” she recalled, her voice tinged with a mix of nostalgia and unease. The description was peculiar, yet it stuck vividly in her mind, prompting her to search for anything that matched the bizarre image."
"I don’t love the implication that I don’t work, that I’m trying to breeze through life on my inheritance, but I understand why she sees it that way. The truth behind everything isn’t important right now, and if this goes the way I hope it","will, this will be an easy twelve days together and then we’ll never have to see each other again. “Anna, are you available to do this? Please. I will pay all your expenses. I will even give you some money if you need to buy clothes.”",91,"completion> goes, I'll be able to show her otherwise. It's about patience and timing. I've been planning for years, not just living off my family's wealth. Every move I've made has been strategic, from the investments I've made to the skills I've honed. I know it might seem like I'm playing the waiting game, but I'm laying the groundwork for something big. Once the timing is right, everything will fall into place, and my efforts will speak louder than any assumptions. Until then, I'll keep my plans close and my patience longer."
"Anna points at me again. “Okay, I see that look, and so",let me ask: what manner of clothes are required on this trip?”,24,"what you're thinking, but it's not going to happen,” she says firmly, leaving no room for argument."
"“No, no, no.” Anna sits up and runs her fingers under her eyes, clearing away much of the mascara there. She pulls her ponytail free and reties it. Both actions do wonders for how chaotic she looks.",“This is much more demanding. I’ll have to act. I’ll have to learn about everyone I’ll be meeting. I’ll have to manage your complete lack of humor. I’ll have to hobnob. This is an entirely new skill set.”,75,"She drags a hand down her face, smearing the remnants of her makeup into a less dramatic, more tired pattern. Her eyes, now slightly reddened from the irritation, give away her exhaustion. She stands up, her movements sluggish, and walks over to the window, staring out at the rain-soaked cityscape. The dim light filtering through the curtains casts long shadows across the room, mirroring the turmoil within her. She takes a deep breath, trying to muster the courage to face the day ahead, knowing full well that the challenges she'll encounter will require more than just a fresh face and a new hairstyle."
"“Babe, babe,” she says, cupping my cheeks. “There is",no downside here. Are you kidding? This is life-altering good.”,19,"something I must tell you before we go any further,” she continues, her voice trembling slightly, hinting at the gravity of her words."
"“Insurance,” she says. “These people insure everything.” While I continue to stare at the rock, she returns to the list and laughs. “Get","this: ‘Anna, please feel free to schedule any hair, nails, spa, or grooming appointments and use the card to pay for those.’ ”",46,"their car insured against alien abduction,” she adds with a smirk, folding the paper neatly and sliding it back into her pocket. “I guess some folks just want to feel protected from the unknown.” She glances at me, her eyes twinkling with amusement, then turns her gaze back to the rock, her expression softening as if considering its own kind of mystery. “It’s like they’re buying peace of mind, no matter how absurd the idea might seem.”"
There are two kinds of airport people: those who like to get to the,"airport three hours before departure to sit within eyesight of the gate, and Anna Green.",29,"airport early, securing a good spot for their luggage and allowing plenty of time for security checks and potential delays, and those who rush in at the last minute, often causing chaos and stress for themselves and others, as they try to navigate through the crowded terminals with just enough time to catch their flight. The early birds tend to be more relaxed and less prone to travel-related anxiety, while the last-minute rushers often experience heightened stress levels, which can affect their overall travel experience negatively."
"My eyes go wide, meeting Anna’s just as she stumbles,","ankle twisting awkwardly on the skinny, murder-sharp heel of her shoe.",21,"her hands reaching out, desperately trying to catch herself before she falls. The sudden movement startles me, and without thinking, I lunge forward, grabbing her arm just in time to prevent a painful collision with the ground. Her eyes, wide with shock and gratitude, lock onto mine, and in that moment, I feel a surge of protective instinct. ""Are you okay?"" I ask, my voice laced with concern, as I help her to her feet, ensuring she's stable before taking a step back. ""I think so,"" she replies, her breath coming out in short gasps, ""thanks to you."" A small smile tugs at the corner of her lips, and I can't help but return the gesture, feeling oddly reassured by the connection we've just shared. ""No problem,"" I say, trying to sound nonchalant, but my heart is racing from the adrenaline of the near miss. ""Let's get you somewhere to sit down."" I guide her gently towards a nearby bench, my mind racing to make sense of the whirlwind of emotions that just swept through me. As we sit, the initial chaos begins to settle, and I find myself wondering about the unexpected depth of my reaction to her near fall. It's as if, in that split second, our lives intersected on a level deeper than mere chance, leaving an imprint that I can't quite shake off. Anna looks at me, her gaze lingering with a mix of curiosity and something that might be the beginning of trust. ""Who are you?"" she asks, her voice softer now, the tension from before seemingly dissolved. ""I'm "
"I can’t entirely refute this idea. I’ve been out of my parents’ circle long enough to understand how disorienting it will be for Anna to step into it. She bends her fingers, turning her hand and looking at them from another angle. Frankly, they’re so pointy I’m worried she’ll scratch her own cornea.","“But I asked the woman at the spa what the really rich ladies get, and she said it’s this fancy hard gel. I think I get the urge to have fake nails. I feel like a badass.” Twisting in her seat, she deposits her purse in my lap. “Watch this for a sec?”",106,
"“Okay, okay. I’m on my way.” Slinging her purse over my shoulder and collecting our carry-ons, I make my way to the ladies’ room, where","Anna peeks out into the hallway. As soon as she sees me, she reaches forward, grabbing the front of my shirt and jerking me inside.",50," I quickly freshen up, trying to ignore the slight queasiness in my stomach. Exiting the restroom, I spot Alex waiting near the gate, his brow furrowed in a mix of concern and impatience. ""Sorry, traffic,"" I offer with a half-smile, hoping to ease his tension. He nods, understanding, and we head towards the exit, our pace quickened by the urgency to catch our flight. As we navigate through the bustling airport, I can't help but feel a mix of excitement and anxiety. This trip, although unplanned, feels like a necessary detour, a chance to reconnect and perhaps address the growing distance between us. The air is crisp, a welcome change from the humid city heat, and I take a deep breath, trying to center myself. Alex slips his hand into mine, a silent promise of support. Together, we make our way to the departure board, our steps echoing a rhythm of anticipation and hope for the journey ahead."
Apologizing over her shoulder to a woman washing her hands at the sink—“I swear we,aren’t going to have sex in here!”—Anna pulls me into a stall and flips the lock.,31,"didn't mean to bump into you,” he muttered, his face flushing a deep shade of red. The woman, seemingly unfazed, continued her task, offering a brief, understanding nod before returning to her soap and water. The young man, relieved that the incident seemed to pass without further confrontation, hurriedly exited the restroom, his mind replaying the awkward encounter over and over."
"“I need you there,” I clarify. “And I need you to look like you’re comfortable with me, comfortable","being married to me. But I don’t need you to pretend to not be Anna Green, Muppet-human hybrid.”",36,"to be my date,” I continue, “so when we walk in, everyone will see us as a perfect couple, no questions asked.”"
Her eyes go round. “The fam—” Anna shakes her head. “You know what? Never mind. Of,"course you have a plane.” Straightening, she asks, “So, why was I in Cambodia? Photography? Fabric design?”",33,"course I do,"" he says, his voice dripping with sarcasm. ""But since you've decided to change the subject, let's talk about something else. Maybe about how you always manage to mess things up, Anna?"""
"Once, when we were roommates, Anna flew to Seattle with a friend. It had been her first time on an airplane, and she struggled so much navigating the travel website that she brought me her laptop at midnight and asked for help. I finished the transaction for her, prebooked the car","to the airport, and then quietly tracked the ride the day she left to make sure she got there okay. When she got home, she made a point of thanking me for the help. Apparently, the trip itself was fine, but the highlight for her had been flying on an airplane.",102,"and arranged the accommodations. She was so nervous about the flight that I even packed her carry-on for her, double-checking to make sure she had everything from toothpaste to her beloved stuffed animal, Mr. Fluffles. The day of the trip, I walked her to the airport, holding her hand until she made it through security. She was a bundle of nerves, but I could see her excitement too. She waved as she disappeared into the departure hall, and I felt a mix of pride and sadness. I missed her immediately. Later that evening, I received a flurry of texts from her, full of exclamation marks and emojis, telling me how beautiful the clouds looked from above and how surprisingly smooth the flight was. She had survived her first flight solo, and it was one of those moments that deepened our friendship. From then on, Anna was no longer just my roommate; she was my travel buddy, and I was always ready to assist her with her next adventure."
"“That person deserves jail time.” She brings the glass to her lips, taking a tiny","sip. “Mmmmm.” Anna turns to meet my eyes. “And by the way, it’s anything over ninety-nine.”",31,"sip of the cold liquid, her eyes never leaving the man across the room, her mind racing with thoughts of justice and retribution."
Anna’s smiling at me like I amuse her. “I meant more as,"in, is she nice? Does she have hobbies or a favorite band?”",24,"an inside joke or something we've shared before,"" she explains, her eyes twinkling with a hint of nostalgia."
“Oh. Power. I like it. I’m not sure how to wield,"it, but I like it. And you have three siblings, including Jake?”",23,"it effectively, but I feel its potential is immense. Perhaps through careful study and practice, I can harness its true strength and use it to achieve my goals, though I must be cautious not to let it corrupt my intentions or harm others in the process."
I feel her looking at me for a quiet beat. “I think you’re joking. I’m,not sure.” Anna downs the rest of her prosecco. “A hint of danger. I like it.”,31,"not,” I say, trying to keep my voice steady, but it cracks slightly. I can't help but wonder if she sees right through me, sees the fear and the longing that I'm desperately trying to hide."
“Is now a good time to discuss how you looked at me like I was lobotomized when I thought,your name was West Weston and yet a man named Kellan McKellan actually exists and will soon be your relative?”,39,"you were trying to explain quantum physics to a cat? It seemed like you were struggling to comprehend the basics, let alone explain them to someone else, and your expression turned into a mix of confusion and disbelief, as if questioning whether I had indeed lost some cognitive functions in that moment."
I can feel her staring a beat longer before she turns away to hand her,"empty flute to the flight attendant. Anna returns her focus to me. “Okay, what else?”",30,"her sunglasses to the friend standing beside her, a silent communication passing between them that went unnoticed by the rest of the crowd. They shared a knowing look, a bond that seemed to transcend the noise and chatter around them, as if they were the only two people in the world at that moment. The friend nodded, a subtle gesture, and they both turned their attention back to the stage, their expressions now a mix of anticipation and shared secrets, waiting for the next moment that would bring them closer together."
"West looks at me with unmasked concern. “Please, Anna,” he","says gently like I’m very, very naive. “Just follow my lead.”",21,"pleaded, his voice a mix of desperation and hope. ""Tell me you'll stay and help us fight this."""
"He smiles stiffly, and Gede continues. “Hot water and electricity are generated by solar and wind power; waste is recycled and reused. Meals are all locally sourced, and our restaurants are Michelin-starred. Everything is inclusive, including meals, spa treatments, and activities. We offer kayaking, paddleboarding, and snorkeling. You may also take a paddleboat to any","of the nearby islands to fish. Snorkeling equipment is available in the boathouse just there,” he says, pointing, “and there are two shipwrecks nearby to explore. The interior of the island is thickly forested, and there are marked trails to follow if the mood strikes. Or, you may do absolutely nothing while you are here.”",110,
"Janet steps close, her hair in a perfect white-blond chignon, her collarbones so defined they’re like hangers holding up her delicate","yellow sundress. I have to assume she has an extremely deft plastic surgeon, because she somehow looks like a twenty-five-year-old sixty-year-old.",42,"scarf, the fabric whispering softly with each movement. Her eyes, a striking blue, meet mine with a mix of curiosity and determination, as if she's about to embark on a journey that's both thrilling and daunting. She takes a deep breath, her chest rising and falling with the rhythm of anticipation, and then, with a small, confident smile, she speaks, her voice a melody that commands attention."
"“Anna, darling!” The woman I need to remember is my actual mother-in-law air-kisses","both of my cheeks. “My goodness, in person your hair is so pink!”",26,"her cheeks, her eyes twinkling with a mix of warmth and mischief. ""How have you been, my dear?"" she asks, her voice carrying the melody of a lifetime spent in the same small town, where everyone knows everyone else's business and secrets. ""I heard you've been painting,"" she continues, her hands clasped together in front of her, displaying a hint of pride and curiosity. ""I'd love to see your work. Have you set up a studio yet?"""
“Okay. Well. That’s nice.” Janet pats his hand in hers. “Don’t forget about the cocktail party at six.”,"She leans in, kissing her son’s cheek again. “Can’t wait to get some time with you all to myself.”",37,"Janet stands up, smoothing her dress, her eyes reflecting a mix of concern and determination. ""I'll make sure everything is perfect for it,"" she assures, her voice carrying a hint of resolve. ""You deserve to enjoy yourself tonight, after everything you've been through."" She smiles softly, her hand lingering on his for a moment longer before she releases it and heads towards the door, leaving him with a sense of comfort and a slight flutter of anticipation for the evening ahead."
"“Anna,” he says finally, very gently. “The truth is, you could just smile on my arm and be okay. I promise",I’m not trying to leave you unprepared. The sad reality is that my parents are unlikely to pay you much attention regardless.”,43,"that I will always be here for you, no matter what happens. I want to protect you and make sure you never have to face anything alone. You deserve happiness, Anna, and I want to be the one to give it to you."""
"I walk back inside, realizing I’d been so focused on the sleeping situation, I haven’t properly flailed over the sheer bliss that is our bungalow. In fact, I’m pretty sure the only thing in here I could afford is the roll of eco-friendly toilet paper I can clearly see from where I stand. And even that looks pretty fancy. There’s a real Isle Esme feel to the decor (if you know, you know), with carved bamboo, recycled teak, jellyfish light fixtures, and a massive canopy bed. Wide windows and the open entrance","bring the outside in and allow me to glance over at West, who seems to be mid–mental spiral, managing to look even more morose than he did thirty seconds ago. Isle Esme vibes or not, there will be no headboard breaking here. Near one wall is a chest with our names stamped into the top, a pair of towels folded to look like stingrays, and a jar of chocolate chip cookies that are probably made with the world’s most expensive chocolate but hey, Gede did say it was all-inclusive. I help myself.",184,
"I have a lot of faults. I drink milk from the carton, I never make my bed, I am slothful, and sometimes I’ll just set the new roll of toilet paper on top of the empty roll instead of changing it. A monster. I am also gluttonous: I don’t want a few peanut M&M’s; I want the entire bag. Why have one","margarita when three is such a nice, satisfying number? Everyone knows why! And that’s why I go back for seconds right now. But karma is Team West: his eyes open just as I glance again. They widen and he reaches down to cup his Goddamn before he turns, facing away. “Anna,” he says, his voice spluttering in the water’s spray. “Are you peeking?”",125,
"He was right. Focus was always a challenge, and apparently it didn’t end with baseball. I came here with the knowledge that all I need to do is limp this lie to September, and I can finally exhale, but we’re less than an hour into this farce and I’m already off track:","I peeked, and it was a huge mistake. It’s not that I didn’t know Anna was attractive all those years ago; it’s that we barely saw each other, and I was so driven to finish my degree and never have to work for my father again that Anna—attractive or not—was easy to overlook.",105,"Every little distraction seems to be amplified in this room, designed to scrutinize every twitch and hesitation. My mind wanders, picturing the crisp September air, the weight of the contract finally lifted from my shoulders. But the reality of the situation is suffocating, the weight of the lie pressing down on me with each passing minute. The coach's eyes are like lasers, dissecting my every move, searching for any sign of weakness. I try to steady my breathing, to regain the composure I feigned so convincingly on the field. Yet, the more I try to focus, the more elusive it becomes, slipping through my fingers like grains of sand. I need to get back to the script, to the narrative I've crafted, but the words feel foreign, my tongue heavy with deceit. The clock ticks louder, each second an eternity as I struggle to maintain the facade. I know I can't afford to falter now, not when the stakes are this high. September seems further away with every heartbeat, and the lie grows heavier with each breath I take."
"I smile at her and cup a hand to the side of my mouth, whispering, “It’s okay.” Truthfully, I love that she thinks about this. I love that she’s","horrified by that price. I’m horrified, too. It’s a good thing Anna isn’t my real wife; I would constantly worry that my proximity to this world would destroy her.",58,"she's considerate enough to worry about my feelings. It's a rare quality in people, especially in someone so young. Her eyes, wide with concern, search mine for any hint of distress, and I nod, reassuring her that her worries are unfounded. I take a step closer, lowering my voice further, ""You're amazing for thinking of me like this. It shows a maturity that most don't have."" My words are meant to comfort her, to let her know that her actions are appreciated and that she doesn't need to be anxious about my wellbeing. I wrap her in a gentle hug, hoping to convey the depth of my gratitude and affection through this simple gesture. In that moment, I realize how much she means to me, and I'm filled with a warm, protective feeling. As we pull away, I hold her gaze, my expression soft and sincere. ""Let's just enjoy the moment, okay?"" I suggest, wanting to shift our focus from her worries to the simple pleasure of being together."
"Her hand falls away. “That’s Anna motherfucking Green-hyphen-Weston to you.” She lets out a happy squeal, jogging over",to hug him as well as she can without spilling the shots on either of them. “You look amazing!”,37,"to envelop him in a tight embrace, her relief and joy palpable in the air. ""I can't believe it's really you,"" she murmurs, her voice muffled against his shirt. ""I've missed you so much."" Her grip is firm, a mixture of relief and the strength of emotions that have been pent up for what feels like an eternity. They stand there, in the middle of the room, surrounded by the chaos of the investigation, but in that moment, it's just the two of them, reconnecting after what seems like a lifetime apart."
"The two of them walk back to me, and Jake looks over",his shoulder to make sure we’re alone. “How are my favorite liars doing?”,25,"with a mix of excitement and apprehension, clearly wanting to share the news about their successful adventure."
"“Describe her,” Jake says, leaning in, his hair falling over his forehead in thick waves. There are moments where I see the man he could someday be: playful but grounded, flirtatious but loyal,",clever but humble. I want to know that version of him and worry he will forever be frozen in this caricature of the irresponsible youngest son as long as he works for Weston’s.,66,"driven by a passion that doesn't burn out but rather fuels his determination to make a difference in the world. He's got this warmth about him, a kind of gentle strength that makes you feel safe yet inspired, like he's the anchor in a stormy sea, steady and reassuring. His eyes, they hold a depth, a mix of dreams and realities, a story of both hope and experience, making you want to know every detail of his past, every triumph and trial that shaped him into the man sitting across from you. His smile, when it breaks through, is genuine and infectious, capable of lighting up a room and warming the hearts of those lucky enough to witness it. Despite his playful demeanor, there's a maturity about him, a quiet confidence that speaks of wisdom beyond his years, hinting at a life rich with learning and growth. He listens intently, with an open mind and a compassionate heart, showing a respect for others' opinions and feelings that's rare in today's world. This blend of qualities makes him not just a person, but a friend, someone you'd trust with your secrets and your dreams, someone who believes in the best version of you, pushing you to be more than you ever thought possible. In Jake, you see the potential for a love story not just filled with passion, but with a deep, enduring connection, built on mutual respect, understanding, and a shared vision for a future filled with adventure and happiness."
"Anna barks out a bawdy laugh before covering her mouth with her hand. “Sorry,” she says",from behind it. The diamond on her ring flashes in the flickering light. “That surprised me.”,32,"as she realizes her words were too loud for the library setting. Her cheeks flush with embarrassment, and she quickly glances around to see if anyone else noticed her slip. She hopes her friend, who is equally amused but more composed, will help her navigate this awkward moment without drawing more attention to them."
"“Good. Anna has no poker face. How’s she taking everything?” he asks, and","I know what he’s referring to: the planes, the island, the money. The family.",27,"continuing the conversation seems to be a way to gauge her emotional state, perhaps to assess how much she might be affected by recent events or decisions made. His inquiry suggests a need for reassurance or perhaps a strategic advantage in understanding her psychological state, which could be crucial in a situation requiring her to make decisions or react in a certain way. The context hints at a scenario where emotional stability or the lack thereof could play a significant role, possibly in a high-stakes environment such as a game, negotiation, or a critical decision-making process. His question, therefore, might be a strategic one, aimed at understanding her emotional resilience or susceptibility, which could influence the outcome of the situation at hand."
"With a laugh, Jake rids himself of our shot glasses and snags two tumblers of whiskey off a passing tray. He","hands me one before lifting his own. “Well, whatever. To the final few months: if you pull this off, you’re free.”",42,"stares at me with a mischievous glint in his eye before downing one glass in one gulp, setting a challenge for the both of us. ""You're on,"" I reply, grabbing my own glass, the atmosphere buzzing with excitement as we prepare for what's sure to be a memorable night."
"He looks past me at the party, and I take stock of how he seems from the outside. He’s got Dad’s dark wavy hair and light brown eyes, but like me, he got his height from our mother, who","is almost six feet tall without the benefit of heels. Jake is good-looking, charismatic, and always up for some (mostly) good-hearted shit-stirring. My stomach sours with guilt for what I’m keeping from him. What I could potentially fuck up.",78,"stood tall at five-foot-ten. His posture is relaxed, but there's a certain confidence in the way he holds himself, a nonchalance that suggests he's comfortable in his own skin. His smile, when he turns to acknowledge someone else, is warm and genuine, and it makes me wonder about the person behind that confident exterior. His outfit, a casual yet stylish ensemble, seems to suit him perfectly, hinting at a sense of personal style. As I watch him interact with others, I notice the way he listens intently, his eyes fixed on the speaker, showing genuine interest. It's clear he's a good conversationalist, engaging people with ease. His laughter, when it bubbles up, is infectious, drawing others into his circle. I can't help but feel a twinge of familial pride, despite the fact that we're not related by blood. He embodies so many of the traits I admire in my own father, yet he brings his own unique flair to them. It's a reminder that genetics only provide a blueprint, and it's life's experiences that truly shape us."
"She laughs, angling her wrist so the diamond catches the lights overhead. “I know, right? For six months I just walked",around taking photos where I had to casually point at something with my left hand.” She scans the crowd. “Where’s Anna?”,42,"around with it, pretending it was just a pretty rock. But now, it's my ticket to a new life,” she whispers, her eyes gleaming with a mix of excitement and trepidation."
"I look up, too, searching the room again. She’s over by the dance floor, jumping around with little Nixon’s hands in hers.","The band is playing covers of pop hits, and Anna is entirely in her element: laughing, dancing, blissfully forgetting where she is.",44,"My heart clenches painfully in my chest, a mix of emotions flooding me. I watch as she laughs, her hair bouncing with each jump, Nixon's face lit up with pure joy. It's a picture of innocence and happiness, something I've longed to see again. Yet, seeing her with someone else, so effortlessly happy, stings. It's a reminder of what I lost, a life I thought I had. I turn away, unable to watch any longer, tears threatening to spill. The room seems to close in, each sound amplified, the music too loud, the laughter too sharp. I need to leave, to escape the pain, but my feet stay rooted to the spot. I'm paralyzed, unable to move forward or backward."
"Janet smiles tightly. “Exactly.” Welp, there it is. She turns her",laser focus to me. “How do your professors react to your hair?”,23,"back to her book, her expression unreadable, the silence stretching between them like a thick blanket, each lost in their own thoughts about the conversation just had."
"“It’s unlikely,” I say, and every head turns my way. “Everyone needs seven to nine hours of sleep a night. You can try to convince yourself","you don’t need more, but over time you’ll build up a sleep debt. It probably affects your mental and physical health more than you realize, Alex.”",52,"that it's sufficient, but your body will eventually remind you otherwise. The truth is, adequate sleep is essential for cognitive function, emotional regulation, and overall health. Without it, you might feel alert for a short while, but soon enough, you'll experience fatigue, decreased concentration, and a higher risk of various health issues. It's a natural process that helps your body repair and rejuvenate itself, preparing you for the next day's challenges. So, while it might seem like a waste of time, sleep is actually one of the most important activities for maintaining a healthy lifestyle."
"“And what’s the deal with Alex? Based on the way you talked about him on the plane, I expected you","two to jovially poke at each other, but that was like dragging a proverbial sword through each other with your eyeballs.”",41,"to be best friends or something. He seems like a cool guy, but you barely mentioned him since we've been here. Is everything okay between you two?"""
"“Well, mostly because he’s an asshole. But also, kids growing up in a normal family get to be themselves, whoever that may be. But in families like","ours, one where everything basically revolves around keeping a single person happy—my dad—everybody has a role. My therapist used to refer to Alex as a flying monkey.”",54,"our house, there are expectations and roles you have to fulfill, whether you fit them or not. It's about maintaining appearances and upholding traditions, even if it means stifling individuality. So, when someone finally breaks free from that mold, it's seen as a rebellion, a sign of disrespect, rather than a courageous act of self-discovery. It's sad, really, how freedom is often perceived as a threat in such environments."
"“Like in The Wizard of Oz? Alex was my dad’s willing henchman, doing everything he said, kissing his ass, stirring up","shit just to turn us all in, then sit back and look like the good guy. He’s never grown out of it.”",43,"trouble wherever he went. It was creepy, the way Alex idolized my father, almost like he was living in his shadow, trying to emulate him in every way, even the bad ones. It made me uncomfortable, knowing Alex was always lurking around, ready to do my father's bidding without question, no matter how dubious the task. It was unsettling, to say the least."
"“What does that mean?” I ask. If Alex knew enough, he wouldn’t try",to take West down? Is this about the mysterious loophole in the trust?,26,"to answer my question with certainty; his silence speaks volumes about his uncertainty and the complexity of the situation we're navigating through. It's clear that the phrase holds more weight and significance than he initially let on, and now, in this moment of silence, I realize the gravity of the information he might be withholding, possibly out of concern or fear of the repercussions it might bring if disclosed improperly. The tension in the air thickens as we both sit with the unanswered question, a silent agreement hanging between us to proceed cautiously, understanding that the truth, though potentially liberating, could also be a double-edged sword. "
West sits on the bench and pulls a shoe off. I set my clutch down on a shelf in the open closet. “I’m thinking Alex will take a keen,"interest in exactly how happy we seem.” I narrow my eyes, staring into the distance. “West… this assignment is no longer just ‘show up and wear a wedding ring.’ ”",59,"interest in this case,” I say, observing the way his eyes flicker with curiosity. He nods slowly, considering the implications of my words. “It’s not every day someone stumbles upon a mystery like this. We should be careful, though. The last thing we need is to attract unwanted attention.” I grab my clutch, feeling the weight of the small notebook inside, filled with cryptic notes and sketches. “Let’s review what we know and plan our next steps. We need to be methodical if we’re going to solve this.” West stands up, his posture straightening as he prepares to engage in our impromptu investigation. “First, let’s check the closet for anything else that might be out of place,” he suggests, his voice laced with determination. I agree, knowing that every detail could be a crucial clue. As we begin our search, the dim light of the closet casts long shadows, adding an eerie atmosphere to our quest for truth. The silence is palpable, broken only by the occasional creak of the old house and our whispered exchanges as we examine each item meticulously. West’s analytical mind is evident as he points out inconsistencies in the arrangement of the clothes, suggesting that someone might have been here recently. My heart races with a mix of excitement and apprehension. This mystery is more than just a puzzle; it feels personal, as if we’re unraveling a piece of someone’s hidden life. We continue our search, each finding a new piece to the enigma that is slowly revealing itself in the quiet of the old house. Our determination to uncover the truth binds us together, pushing us forward despite the unknowns that lie ahead."
"I woke up around two this morning to find Anna wrapped around me. Despite what she’d told me about sleeping in one place all night, at some point she’d migrated across the massive bed to throw a","leg over my hip, send an arm over my torso, and press her face to my neck. It took monumental focus to not go hard against her inner thigh, and because of it, I’d slept like absolute shit.",75,"her arm over my neck, her breath warm against my ear. I tried to gently extricate myself, not wanting to wake her, but she murmured sleepily and tightened her grip. I lay there for a few moments, watching the dim light from the streetlamps filter through the curtains, considering the complexities of our relationship. Anna had a way of complicating my life, yet at the same time, she was the most comforting presence I had known in a long time. Her actions, often impulsive and driven by emotions she struggled to understand, created a dynamic that was both exhilarating and exhausting. As I finally managed to slip out of her embrace without waking her, I couldn't help but wonder how our paths had intertwined so intricately, leading us to this moment where sleep claimed us in each other's arms, a silent promise of support and companionship in the quiet hours of the night."
"My father’s question penetrates my fog, finally, and I straighten, pushing my salt-water-and-sweat damp hair off my forehead. The sun has only","just come up and it’s already sweltering. I bet Anna has already kicked off the blankets, letting the air cool her overheated skin.",45,"to rise, casting a golden hue over the ocean's surface, making the water shimmer with a thousand tiny diamonds. The salty breeze carries the scent of the sea, mingling with the fresh, earthy aroma of the land, reminding me of the vastness of the world beyond our small beach. My feet, buried in the warm, dry sand, feel the gentle tug of the waves as they creep closer, inch by inch, reclaiming the shore. The distant sound of seagulls calls to me, their cries blending with the rhythmic crash of waves against the shore, creating a symphony of nature that's both calming and invigorating. I take a deep breath, the air filling my lungs with vitality, and I turn to face my father, ready to answer his question, whatever it may be."
"“JESUS CHRIST,” I BLURT, the second I turn at the corner of our bridge and step onto the deck of our bungalow. Anna is curled up in","a papasan, with a sketch pad in her seemingly bare lap. Honestly, from the first glimpse I get, I think she might be naked. “What are you doing?”",55,"the fetal position, her eyes squeezed shut, her hands gripping the sheets. The room is silent except for the rhythmic sound of her breathing. I rush to her side, kneeling down to look into her face, searching for any sign of distress. ""Anna, talk to me, what's wrong?"" My voice is laced with concern, my hands hovering over her, unsure of how to help. She takes a deep, shuddering breath and slowly opens her eyes, revealing a storm of emotions behind them. ""I had the most terrifying dream,"" she begins, her voice a whisper, ""I was drowning, and you weren't there to save me."" Her words send a chill down my spine, and I realize the depth of her fear. I pull her into a tight embrace, trying to convey through my hug the promise that I will always be there for her. ""I'm here now, and I'll never leave you,"" I murmur into her hair, holding her as tightly as I can, willing my presence to be a shield against her nightmares. ""Let's get some water, maybe that'll help,"" I suggest gently, hoping to distract her from the remnants of her dream. As I help her sit up, I keep a firm but gentle hold on her, ready to support her in any way she needs. We move slowly towards the kitchen, my mind racing with thoughts of how to make her feel safe again, how to prove that my love is a constant, unwavering force in her life. The night is still young, and I vow to spend it ensuring that Anna knows she is cherished, that her fears are heard, and that she will never face them alone."
"Anna follows me. She’s loosely made the bed, but it still looks rumpled.",Slept in. By both of us. I squeeze my eyes shut against the reminder.,27,"Anna's actions suggest she's trying to impress me, though her efforts are somewhat lacking in finesse."
I sigh. I know she’s right but I’m already sleep-deprived and functioning on less than full brain power today.,I’m not sure I’m capable of dealing with both my family and Anna in this suit after last night. “Fine.”,39,"Every decision I make feels like it's clouded by fatigue, and I worry that my judgment is compromised. I need to find a way to recharge, but with my current schedule, that seems nearly impossible. Maybe a short nap could help, but I risk falling into a deeper sleep and missing important responsibilities. I'm caught in a cycle of exhaustion that I can't seem to break free from, and it's affecting every aspect of my life."
“Oh!” Anna jerks a hand over her eyes. “Your Goddamn! Right there!” She turns away. “Sorry! I just—spaced,out—on your—God. And you’re not even harrrrrrr—Fuck me.” She coughs. “Okay. I’ll just meet you down at the restaurant.”,37,"She had been so engrossed in her thoughts, lost in the labyrinth of her mind, that the sudden noise and proximity startled her back to reality. Now, with her back to the person who had spoken, she takes a deep breath, trying to regain her composure. Her heart is racing, a mix of embarrassment and relief washing over her. She mutters under her breath, ""I'm such an idiot,"" before turning back slowly, ready to face the person she had inadvertently offended."
"I can feel Anna’s eyes on the side of my face. This is how it always starts with Alex, and whatever suspicion he has about my marriage will only make it","worse. I know it’s irrational and a remnant of how we used to one-up each other for our dad’s approval when we were kids, but I want to beat him. At everything.",63,"begin to unravel. He's like a detective, piecing together the fragments of our past, the moments I've tried so hard to bury. His curiosity is relentless, fueled by a mix of concern and something that borders on obsession. I can see it in his eyes, the way his brow furrows when he thinks he's figured something out, and the way his voice drops to a whisper when he asks questions that shouldn't matter but clearly do. Each revelation brings us closer to the truth, a truth I've been running from for far too long. I know I have to confront the reality of my marriage, face the lies I've told myself, and the ones I've told him. It's a daunting task, but with Alex's unwavering support and determination, I might just find the courage to face the past and finally move forward."
"Anna slams the brakes on this line of thinking by putting an arm around my back, resting the other hand on my stomach","and gently scratching, just like she unconsciously did last night. I work to suppress a shiver. Turning, she looks at him over her shoulder.",47,"and giving me a gentle squeeze, her eyes filled with concern and a hint of fear. ""We need to talk,"" she says, her voice steady but betraying the turmoil beneath the surface. ""About what's been going on, about us, about everything that's been weighing on you lately."" Her presence is a grounding force amidst the storm of my thoughts, reminding me of the life we've built together and the love that anchors us. ""I'm here for you,"" she continues, her grip tightening slightly, ""no matter what you're going through, we'll face it together."" Her words, simple yet profound, cut through the fog of my worries, offering a glimmer of hope and a path forward. In that moment, I realize the strength of our bond, the resilience we've cultivated over the years, and the unwavering support she provides. It's a reminder that, even in the darkest times, love can be a guiding light. As we sit in the car, parked at the side of the road, the world seems to pause, giving us a moment to reconnect and reaffirm our commitment to each other."
"Eko goes through the basics of paddling, giving us tips about what areas of the",reef to avoid as we approach. “Is everyone comfortable with the basics of kayaking?” she asks.,31,"boat to focus on for better control and efficiency. He explains the importance of maintaining a steady rhythm with your strokes, using a combination of arms and core muscles to generate power and ensuring that each stroke propels the boat forward rather than just moving the oar through the water. Eko also emphasizes the need for a relaxed grip on the oars, which helps prevent fatigue and allows for smoother, more controlled movements. He suggests practicing on calm waters to build confidence and technique before attempting more challenging conditions. Additionally, he advises paying attention to the wind and current, adjusting your paddling angle and pace accordingly to make the most of these natural elements and maintain a straight course. Lastly, Eko stresses the importance of regular practice and patience, as mastering paddling skills takes time and consistent effort."
"I reach back, pulling my T-shirt up and off, tossing it to the side. Alex hesitates and","then does the same, his expression turning homicidal when I smirk down at his soft little paunch.",34,"he hesitates, his eyes widening as he takes in the sight of my bare torso, a mix of surprise and curiosity flashing across his face. Unsure of how to proceed, he fumbles with his own shirt, torn between his professional demeanor and the sudden intimacy of the moment. ""Uh, should I turn around?"" he stammers, clearly out of his comfort zone, yet unable to look away."
"Alex snorts, looking at her derisively, like she’s an idiot. In a hot","flush, my hackles are up, and every rational thought goes out the window.",26,"mess of tangled limbs and sweaty skin. He rolls off her, breathing heavily, clearly unsatisfied, and gets up from the bed without another word, leaving her confused and hurt."
"“Course you are, sweetheart,” I say, steadying my voice and looking down at Anna.",“I went running without you this morning and you really let me have it.”,28,"My eyes scan her face, searching for any sign of the turmoil I know must be raging inside her, but she looks back at me with a calm that seems almost unnatural, given the circumstances."
"“We work out together every morning.” I’m speaking to Alex but holding Anna’s gaze. Maybe it’s the pent-up frustration from last night, or maybe my brother just","brings out the worst in me and the best way to drag him is through his wife’s dissatisfaction, but I keep going. “Gets the blood flowing, doesn’t it?”",55,"it's just who he is. He's competitive, always pushing himself and others to do better. I can't help but admire that drive, even if it sometimes gets on my nerves. Anna's eyes narrow slightly, a silent challenge in her expression, and I know she's thinking about how to step up her own game. She's never one to back down from a challenge, especially when it involves family. We all have our ways of dealing with stress and competition, and for us, it's through physical activity and a bit of sibling rivalry. It's how we bond, in a way, through our shared love for fitness and the occasional sparring of words and wills."
"And that much is immediately apparent. She trips as she tries to climb in. I hold the boat steady for her, but she still ends up getting","in backward and then having to awkwardly turn around in the tiny space. I pretend to scratch my shoulder with my chin, glancing behind us. Fuck. Alex noticed.",55," wet and disheveled, her face flushed with embarrassment and exertion. She glares at me, her pride wounded, but there's a hint of gratitude in her eyes. ""Thanks,"" she mutters, her voice a mix of annoyance and relief. I nod, offering a small, understanding smile. ""No problem,"" I say, trying to lighten the mood. ""Let's just get you settled in the cabin, and then we can figure out how to make this work."" I help her up, steadying her as she regains her balance, and together we head towards the cabin, leaving the awkwardness of the moment behind us for now. The sea is calm, the stars above us twinkling like a million tiny diamonds, and the night air is cool against our faces. Despite the initial mishap, there's a sense of adventure and camaraderie that begins to take root, a promise of the journey ahead. As we disappear into the cabin, I can't help but feel hopeful about what the coming days might bring."
"Just then, Anna looks over and lets out a high-pitched shriek. “West! A sea turtle!” She","leans to the side, and her oar slides off her lap and into the clear water.",32,"runs towards the water, her eyes wide with excitement and concern. ""West! Come here!"" she shouts, waving her arms frantically. The dog, initially confused, soon picks up on Anna's excitement and bounds towards her, tail wagging furiously. As they reach the water's edge, Anna kneels down, pointing at the gentle giant surfacing for air. ""It's a loggerhead sea turtle, West! Be careful, they're protected!"" she instructs, her voice a mix of awe and caution. West, though eager, stays close, his nose almost touching Anna's hand as they both watch the turtle glide back into the depths, leaving only ripples on the calm sea surface."
"“He and I have never been close,” I say quickly, suddenly and deeply uninterested in spending the morning anywhere but right","here with Anna. “I think from the moment he was born, the only thing he cared about was impressing our father.”",42,"here with her, away from the prying eyes and the weight of expectations that seem to follow us like shadows. My words hang in the air, a barrier between us, as she looks at me, her expression unreadable. She takes a deep breath, the kind that suggests she's about to share something profound, or perhaps something she's struggled to voice. ""I know,"" she says softly, her voice barely above a whisper, carrying the weight of unspoken truths. ""But maybe it's time we change that. Maybe there's more to our relationship than we've allowed ourselves to see."" Her eyes meet mine, holding a glimmer of hope and a challenge all at once. It's a moment suspended in time, where the future feels both uncertain and full of potential."
“You drive Alex crazy because he can’t ever beat you even though he’s the older,brother. He’s probably jealous because you’re tall and hot and smart and he’s short and—”,30,"brother, and it frustrates him to no end, making him act out in ways that are not very becoming of his age."
