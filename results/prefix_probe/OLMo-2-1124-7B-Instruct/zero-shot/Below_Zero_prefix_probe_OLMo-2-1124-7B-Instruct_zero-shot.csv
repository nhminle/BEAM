"The truth, though, is quite the opposite. I hated school at first sight—with the direct consequence that school hated the sullen, listless child that I was right back. In the first grade, I refused to learn how to write my name, even though Hannah is only three letters repeated twice. In junior high, I set a school record for the highest number of consecutive detention days—what happens when","you decide to take a stand and not do homework for any of your classes because they are too boring, too difficult, too useless, or all of the above.

I didn’t really have a plan for after, except for leaving now behind.",137,"what happens when you deliberately rip pages out of your math textbook and then refuse to attend the mandatory meetings with the principal to discuss your actions. My teachers were at a loss, and my classmates often found me an oddity. I was the kid who would doodle in his notebook during lessons, the one who would daydream about anything but the subject at hand. I didn't care about grades, nor did I seek approval from my peers. I was a lone wolf in a den of social creatures, and I thrived in my solitude. It wasn't until high school that something shifted. A new teacher, Mr. Thompson, took an interest in me. He saw beyond my disinterested exterior and recognized the potential that lay dormant. He challenged me, not with threats or punishments, but with genuine curiosity and encouragement. For the first time, I felt someone believed in me, and that changed everything. I started to care about my education, not because I suddenly loved school, but because I didn't want to let Mr. Thompson down. Slowly, I began to enjoy learning, not for the sake of grades or accolades, but for the sheer joy of understanding something new. By the time I graduated, I had become a different person—one who appreciated the value of education and the impact a single teacher could have on a student's life. School, once a place of hatred, had transformed into a place of growth and discovery."
"“It’s like space is your whole personality,” the girl I casually hooked up with during most of my sophomore year of undergrad told me. It was after I explained that no, thank you, I wasn’t interested in going out for coffee to meet her friends because of a lecture on","Kalpana Chawla I was planning to attend. “Do you have any other interests?” she asked. I threw her a quick “Nope,” waved good-bye, and wasn’t too surprised when, the following week, she didn’t reply to my offer to meet up. After all, I clearly couldn’t give her what she wanted.",100,
"“Yeah, I’m not sure.” She shrugs and continues to make her way through a Tupperware of broccoli, an apple, and approximately two fucktons of Cheez-Its. “I don’t really know much about him. His parents divorced, then people in my family had arguments and stopped talking to each other. There was a lot of","prime Floyd dysfunction happening, so I haven’t actually spoken to him in years. But I heard from one of my other cousins that he was working on that thing that landed on Mars back when we were in high school. It was called something like . . . Contingency, or Carpentry, or Crudity—”",106,
"“I think so. Do the dates add up? Maybe it was some kind of summer internship? But honestly, it might just be Floyd family lore. I have an aunt who insists that we’re related to","the Finnish royals, and according to Wikipedia there are no Finnish royals. So.” She shrugs and pops another handful of Cheez-Its in her mouth. “Would you like me to ask around, though? For the assignment?”",70,"some famous person from the past, like a distant cousin of George Washington or something. She has this old, faded photograph that she claims is of our great-great-grandfather shaking hands with him. Of course, there's no proof, and none of the rest of the family takes it seriously, but Aunt Edna is quite convinced. She's always pulling out this photo at family gatherings, pointing out the similarities in our facial structures and insisting that we must investigate our lineage further. I suppose it's possible that this story has been passed down through generations, growing more elaborate with each telling. It's a charming idea, though, and it adds a bit of mystery to our family history. Perhaps there's a real story behind it waiting to be uncovered, or maybe it's just one of those delightful family myths that everyone enjoys hearing about."
"“By the way, I sent you my cousin-or-something’s contact info a while ago,” Mara tells me one night. We’re at the",cheapest grad bar we’ve been able to find. She’s on her second Midori sour of the night. “Did you get it?”,42,"next table at the local diner, finishing up our late-night study session. ""Did you get it? I hope it wasn't a hassle,"" she adds, biting into her sandwich. I nod, checking my phone to confirm the details. ""I just wanted to make sure you could reach out if you needed help with anything,"" Mara explains, her eyes scanning a textbook. ""Thanks, Mara. It's really thoughtful of you,"" I say, feeling a bit more connected to her extended family now. ""No problem,"" she smiles, taking a sip of her iced tea. ""Family's important, you know?"""
"He frowns, as if momentarily blanking on Mara’s name. “Ah, yes.” He nods. Only once. “Apparently,” he adds, which makes me laugh. He waits for me to take a seat","across from him before folding back in his chair. I notice that he doesn’t hold out his hand, nor does he smile. Interesting. “Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.”",61,"before he leans back in his chair, crossing his arms over his chest. ""You see,"" he begins, his tone shifting to one of earnest explanation, ""Mara has been quite the handful lately. Between her new project at the lab and her involvement with the community outreach programs, she's spread thinner than most butter at room temperature. It's impressive, really, but it's also taken a toll on her. I'm just concerned she's biting off more than she can chew."" He pauses, observing me intently, as if gauging my reaction to his words. ""And that's not even the half of it. There's been some... tension, shall we say, with a few colleagues. Nothing major, but enough to make her days a bit more stressful. I just want to make sure she's okay, that she's not letting all of this get to her."" He lets out a sigh, the weight of his worries momentarily lifting from his shoulders. ""But she's strong, Mara. I have no doubt she'll manage. It's just... hard to watch her go through this."" His gaze drifts away, lost in thought, before returning to me with a renewed sense of determination. ""Anyway, I just wanted to fill you in. If there's anything more you need to know, or if there's anything I can do to help, just let me know."" His offer is genuine, his concern palpable, and it's clear he's not just talking about Mara. He cares, deeply, about everyone involved in this intricate web of relationships and responsibilities."
"“Officially: unclear. But I’m fairly sure my brother made CDs of it. Sent them to local TV stations and whatnot.” He gestures vaguely, and his forearm is dusted with freckles and pale-red hair. I want to grab his wrist, hold it in front","of my eyes, study it at my leisure.

"The section is in C++. Which happens to be the very first language I taught myself back in high school, when every single Google search for “Skills + Necessary + NASA” led to the sad result of “Programming.” Python came after. Then SQL. Then HAL/S. For each language, I started out convinced that chewing on","glass would surely be preferable. Then, at some point along the way, I began thinking in terms of functions, variables, conditional loops. A little after that, reading code became a bit like inspecting the label on the back of the conditioner bottle while showering: not particularly fun, but overall easy. I do have some talents, apparently.",111,
"My heart rate picks up. Warmth twists in my lower stomach. I lean forward with a smile, feeling like I’m finally in my element. This, this, is what I know best. Depending on how busy I am with school, or work, or binge-watching K-dramas,","I do this about once a week.

In the hustle and bustle of daily life, baking is my sanctuary, a place where I can lose myself in the present moment, creating and nurturing life from raw ingredients."
"It sends me right over the edge. Into something that’s nothing like my usual, run-of-the-mill orgasm. Those tend to start like small fractures and then slowly, gradually deepen into something lovely and relaxing. Those are fun, good fun, but this . . . This pleasure is sudden and violent. It splinters into me like a wonderful, terrible explosion, new and frightening and fantastic,","and it goes on and on, as though every heart-stopping, delicious second of it is being squeezed out of me.

It's as if every nerve ending is set ablaze, sending shockwaves of ecstasy through my entire being. The intensity is overwhelming, making me question my own understanding of pleasure. It's raw and primal, a sensation so powerful it's almost terrifying. I find myself gripping the sheets, my knuckles turning white from the force of my own grip, as I'm catapulted into realms of ecstasy I never knew existed. It's a rollercoaster of emotions, where euphoria and fear dance together in a dizzying whirlwind. The aftermath leaves me spent, my body trembling from the sheer force of the experience. I lay there, panting, trying to make sense of what just happened, wondering if I'll ever be able to experience anything as profound again. This newfound depth of pleasure has forever altered my perception of intimacy and self-awareness, leaving me both exhilarated and humbled by the power of human sensation."
"The last words I hear from him are, “It was really good to meet you, Hannah.” I think I should say it back, but there’s an unfamiliar weight in my chest, and I can’t quite bring myself to do it.

My heart pounds against my ribcage, a drumbeat of confusion and regret. I should have said it back, I realize, but the words stick in my throat, unspoken. The weight in my chest feels like a stone, heavy and unyielding. I watch the elevator ascend, carrying him away, and I'm left with the echo of his parting words and the haunting question of what went wrong. Did I miss something? Was there something I should have said? The uncertainty gnaws at me, and I feel a sudden, desperate need to understand. I turn and walk away, my mind racing, trying to piece together the last moments, the subtle shifts in his demeanor, the things left unsaid. I wonder if I'll ever see him again, and if I do, will I muster the courage to speak the words that now feel like a heavy, unshed tear in my eye?"
"The following day, when Mara asks me about my meeting with her cousin-or-something, I say only “Uneventful,” and I don’t even know why. I don’t like lying, and I like lying to someone","who’s rapidly becoming a friend even less, but I can’t make myself say any more than that. Two weeks later, I turn in a reflection paper as part of my Water Resources class requirements.",67,"of that nature even less. I feel a twinge of guilt for not being honest, but the thought of explaining the details of a conversation that was, in fact, utterly mundane seems exhausting. I decide to keep my silence, hoping that she won't press further and that my brief response will suffice. Mara, perhaps sensing my discomfort or simply accepting my brevity, doesn't push the matter. We move on to other topics, and the incident fades into the background of our daily interactions. As the day progresses, I reflect on my response and wonder if perhaps it was the right choice, given the circumstances and my desire to maintain a semblance of peace in our relationship."
"“Avalanche danger is set at the highest level, and it’s not safe for anyone to come out to get me,” I add, speaking right into the satphone’s mic.

It was right before he","reminded me that I’d been the one to choose this. That I’d known what the risks of my mission were, and I still decided to undertake it.

"“Mara. Your cousin’s name is Mara. Keep up, will you?” I fail to",sound stern. “Have you not talked to her since she put us in touch?”,27,"remember the last time we met at the family reunion; she was the one with the long red hair and a contagious laugh. I nodded, focusing on not losing sight of her as she weaved through the crowd, her energy seemingly boundless. My mind, however, was elsewhere, drifting back to the conversation we'd had earlier about our shared childhood memories and the adventures we used to dream up in the attic. It was those moments, simple yet profound, that reminded me of the unbreakable bond we shared despite the years and distances that had kept us apart."
"I laugh. “Well, Mara is great. She also graduated with her Ph.D. and recently moved to D.C. to","work for the EPA. No interest in space stuff.

"It is. AMASE is the shit, and the selection process to take part in an expedition was brutal, to the point that I’m not quite sure how I made it in. Probably sheer luck: Dr. Merel, one of the expedition leaders, was looking","for someone with experience in gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. Which I happen to have, due to some side projects my Ph.D. advisor foisted upon me. At the time, I aggressively bitched and moaned my way through them. In hindsight, I feel a bit guilty.",86,"to fill a critical gap in their team's expertise. I remember the day I received the email, my heart racing as I read the words ""Congratulations, you've been selected."" The email went on to describe the rigorous training regime that awaited us, a preparatory period designed to hone our skills and forge us into a cohesive unit capable of tackling the challenges of the Arctic. The training was intense, involving everything from survival skills to advanced scientific methodology, all under the watchful eyes of seasoned explorers and experts in their respective fields. As we bonded over shared experiences and mutual respect, the initial shock of being chosen gave way to a profound sense of purpose and camaraderie. We were about to embark on a journey that would test our limits and expand our horizons, all in the name of scientific discovery and exploration. The expedition was not just a mission; it was a calling, a chance to contribute to the collective knowledge of our planet and its most remote and untouched regions."
"“Did something happen?” Karl, my office mate, asks from across the desk. “You look like","you’re about to cry. Or maybe throw something out of the window, I can’t tell.”",30,"you've seen a ghost,” I joke, trying to shake off the eerie feeling that's settled over me. He raises an eyebrow, not buying my attempt at humor. “Seriously, Karl, I don't know. Maybe I'm just tired,” I reply, hoping to dismiss the strange sensation. “Or maybe it's because we've been working non-stop for the past three days,” he reasons, glancing at the piles of paperwork surrounding us. “That's true,” I agree, trying to focus on the stacks of reports instead of the unsettling feeling that refuses to leave. “Let's take a break then,” Karl suggests, pushing his chair back. “Good idea,” I say, grateful for the distraction. We stand up, stretching our stiff muscles, and decide to grab some coffee from the vending machine down the hall. As we walk away from the desk, I can't help but glance back at the empty chair across from me, half expecting to see a shadowy figure watching us leave. But of course, there's nothing there, just the dull glow of the office lights. It's probably just stress, I tell myself, hoping that a cup of coffee will help me shake off the last remnants of this strange mood. "

I know that whatever choice I make, it will shape the future in ways I can't yet fully comprehend. As I walk away, I am determined to gather all the information and perspectives I can before coming to a conclusion that will seal my fate and potentially alter the course of our intertwined destinies."
"As we all know, in early 2010, the rover Spirit became stuck in a sand trap, was unable to reorient its solar panels toward the sun, and froze to death as a consequence of its lack of power. Something very similar happened eight years later to Opportunity, which went into hibernation when a maelstrom blocked sunlight and prevented it from recharging its","batteries. Obviously, the risk of losing control of rovers because of extreme weather events is high. To address this, Dr. Arroyo has designed a promising internal system that is less likely to fail in the case of unpredictable meteorological situations. She proposes to build a model and test its efficacy on the next expedition at the Arctic Mars Analog in Svalbard (AMASE)—",124,"battery. Both rovers were designed to last for only 90 days on Mars, but they far exceeded expectations, with Spirit operating for over six years and Opportunity for 14 years. Their longevity was due in part to the Martian environment, which is far less harsh than initially anticipated, and to the diligent care and ingenuity of the mission teams. These teams constantly adapted to the challenges posed by the Martian environment, developing new strategies to keep the rovers operational. The rovers' missions provided invaluable data about the Martian surface, climate, and geology, contributing significantly to our understanding of the planet. They also captured the public imagination, inspiring countless individuals to pursue science and exploration. The success of Spirit and Opportunity demonstrated the power of perseverance, innovation, and international cooperation in scientific endeavors. As humanity looks to the future of space exploration, the lessons learned from these missions continue to guide and inspire."
"Dr. Arroyo’s project is a brilliant addition to NASA’s current roster, and it should be approved for further","study. Dr. Arroyo’s vitae is impressive, and she has accumulated enough experience to carry out the proposed work—",36,"development. The technology it proposes could revolutionize space travel, making missions more efficient and cost-effective. With Dr. Arroyo's expertise and the innovative ideas presented, this project has the potential to advance our understanding of space and expand our reach beyond the current boundaries. The approval would not only validate the hard work and dedication of the team but also set a precedent for future space exploration endeavors, inspiring a new generation of scientists and engineers. The benefits of such a project are manifold, from enhancing our scientific knowledge to inspiring technological advancements that could trickle down to everyday applications. The time to support such groundbreaking work is now, as it aligns perfectly with NASA's mission to explore and understand the universe while pushing the boundaries of what humanity can achieve."
"I met Dr. Merel because he was my direct superior during AMASE, and he is . . . an odd duck, honestly. Very stiff. Very hard-core. NASA is full of ambitious people, but he seems to be almost obsessed with results, publications, the kind of sexy science that makes","big splashy news. Initially I wasn’t a fan, but I must admit that as a supervisor he’s been nothing but supportive. He’s the one who selected me for the expedition to begin with, and he encouraged me to apply for funding once I went to him with my project idea.",99,"completion>the researcher's career. He's the kind of person who would probably have a whiteboard in his office filled with equations and mission timelines, always pushing for the next big discovery. When I first met him, he was already planning our next expedition, talking about potential sites for sampling and the equipment we'd need to take. His demeanor was all business, but there was a spark in his eye that suggested he was passionate about the work, despite his reserved nature. He's the kind of leader who expects nothing but the best from his team, which can be both inspiring and intimidating. His dedication to his field is evident in the way he speaks about it, with a fervor that's almost infectious, despite his formal and somewhat distant approach. He's the kind of person who, once you get past his initial aloofness, can be a great mentor, pushing you to excel and achieve more than you ever thought possible. Under his guidance, I learned the importance of meticulousness and thoroughness in research, understanding that every detail can contribute to a larger scientific narrative. Dr. Merel's approach to his work is a testament to the power of focus and dedication, and it's hard not to be influenced by his work ethic and commitment to advancing our knowledge of the universe."
"“Yes. Of course it would have been convenient if you’d had those funds at your disposal, but I’ve already discussed it with two of","my colleagues who agree that your work is meritorious.

This approach ensures transparency and accountability, which are vital for the integrity and sustainability of our organization."
"“I’ll be there, out in the field with you, of course,” Dr. Merel says. I’m a little surprised. In the months we were in Norway, I saw him do very little sample","collecting and snow plodding. I’ve always thought of him as more of a coordinator. But if he offered, he must mean it, and . . . I smile. “Perfect, then. Thank you.”",64,"collection. He was always in the lab, his fingers dancing over the keyboard, his eyes fixed on the computer screens, analyzing data, running experiments. Now, he's offering to join me in the field, where the air is fresh with the scent of pine and the ground is often muddy underfoot. I wonder if he's changed his mind about the fieldwork, or if he's simply trying to be more involved in our project. Perhaps he's realized the importance of firsthand experience, or maybe he's developed a new appreciation for the challenges of fieldwork. Whatever the reason, I'm grateful for his offer, as it means I won't be alone in navigating the dense forests and rugged terrain. His presence could prove invaluable, especially if we encounter any unexpected obstacles or if we need to make quick decisions based on our observations. I hope his transition to fieldwork goes smoothly, as it will undoubtedly enhance our research and deepen our understanding of the ecosystem we're studying."
"The problems start when he looks up and notices me. He stops exactly two steps below, which should put him at a disadvantage but, depressingly, unfairly, tragically, doesn’t.

I can hear the distant sounds of the city around us, but they seem muted, distant, as if the world has paused to give us this moment. His grip is firm, assuring, and I realize that in this fleeting instant, I am not alone. The weight of my fears and uncertainties press against me, but they are softened by the strength of his embrace. I am acutely aware of every breath he takes, every beat of his heart, and it's strangely comforting. Time seems to stretch and contract at once, the urgency of our situation pressing in while we remain cocooned in his arms. Eventually, my sobs subside into quiet whimpers, and I find myself gazing up at him, seeking solace in his eyes. They are a deep, calming blue, reflecting a depth of emotion that I can't quite fathom. He looks down at me with an expression that's tender, protective, and something else I can't quite place. It's a look that speaks volumes, promising silent words of comfort and understanding. Slowly, my breathing steadies, and I feel a warmth spreading through me, not just from his body but from the connection we've forged in this moment of vulnerability. His fingers gently stroke my hair, a soft caress that sends a shiver down my spine. It's a simple gesture, yet it carries a weight of significance. In this quiet embrace, I find a peace that's rare and precious. As the urgency of our situation looms closer, I know that this moment will stay with me, a beacon of strength and compassion in the midst of chaos. Eventually, he pulls back slightly, his hands still cradling my face, ensuring I meet his gaze. His lips curve into a small, reassuring smile, and I mirror it, feeling a sense of hope and determination stirring within me. We break apart, but the connection remains, a silent promise that we'll face whatever comes together. With a final, gentle squeeze, he releases me, and I step back, feeling oddly invigorated by the experience. Our eyes lock for a moment longer, a shared understanding passing between us, before he turns to address the immediate crisis at hand. I follow, my heart still racing, but with a newfound resolve. Together, we step into the fray, ready to confront whatever challenges lie ahead."

The disregard for safety protocols and ethical considerations is alarming, and I fear for the potential consequences. It's disheartening to see such a project proceed, knowing the harm it could cause. I feel compelled to continue my efforts, even if it means taking more drastic actions to ensure that this project is halted before it's too late."
"“Oh.” I swallow. “Merel was supposed to come for backup. But he wasn’t feeling well. I offered to wait for him, but he said we’d be losing valuable days of data and that I should just go","alone, and I . . .” I squeeze my fingers around the material of Ian’s shirt. “I went. And then, when I called in for help, he told me that the weather was turning, and . . .”",75,"of our research. I hesitated, knowing how crucial his expertise is, but ultimately agreed, trusting his judgment. As I left, I couldn't shake off the feeling of unease, wondering if we'd regret this decision. The days that followed were filled with challenges, and I often found myself wishing Merel was there to guide us. Despite the initial setback, we pressed on, hoping our work would still yield meaningful results. In the end, it taught me the value of teamwork and the importance of not underestimating the impact of individual contributions, even when one is not physically present."
"He shrugs. “I figured you might want to talk through your near-death experience with someone, so",I decided to tell Mara what happened. I did not expect her to come in person.”,32,"it's me, your best friend. Plus, I've always been curious about what happens when you think you're about to kick the bucket."""
"“I was going to. Once I felt less whiny. And—whatever.” I roll my eyes. Wow,",I’m mature. “How did you go from not remembering Mara’s name to having her number?”,30,"but then I remembered how much I hate confrontation, so I chickened out and pretended to be absorbed in my phone instead. It's easier than dealing with his drama."
"“Well, still.” She shrugs. “I promise I don’t have anything against",you personally. I’m just not generally a fan of the Floyd family.”,23,"you. It's just that I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately, and I think I need some space to sort things out in my head."""
"“Yes,” Mara agrees. “Are you going to break my blood relative’s heart?","Don’t get me wrong, I’d still side with you. Hos before bros.”",24,"She asks, her voice trembling with a mix of fear and determination, hoping to prevent the inevitable pain she anticipates."
"“I guess we’ll see. I’m not sure he would want to date,” I say, staring at Sadie’s Froot Loops. The ensuing silence drags on so long,",I’m forced to look up. She and Mara are staring at me like I just announced that I’m quitting my job to take up macramé full-time. “What?”,53,"it feels like the cereal itself is judging me. Finally, Sadie speaks up, her voice laced with a mix of curiosity and determination. ""Why don't you ask him then?"" The simple question, loaded with unspoken possibilities, breaks the tension. I blink, taken aback by the straightforwardness of her suggestion. It's as if she's offering me a lifeline, a chance to steer our conversation towards something more concrete. The idea hadn't occurred to me before, buried under layers of uncertainty and self-doubt. But now, faced with Sadie's unwavering gaze, I feel a flicker of resolve. Maybe it's time to stop guessing and start living. ""You think he'd say yes?"" I ask, my voice barely above a whisper, hoping against hope that the answer is yes."
"“Considering that he saved your life, contacted Great-Aunt Delphina, and put up two dudes he’s never seen",before so their girlfriends could hang out with you . . . I think maybe he does.”,34,"before, it's only fair you help him with his upcoming trial, which could ruin his life if he fails,"" argued Sarah, her voice laced with urgency."
"“Actually, they fixed the elevator. And this new cast is easy to walk on. So, no need. But you . . .” You can","do this, Hannah. Come on. You just survived polar bears thanks to this guy. You can say the words. “You could come up anyway.”",48,"carry the groceries? It seems like you could use some help with that, given your broken leg. Let me assist you with those bags,"" he offered, stepping closer with a concerned look on his face."
"“Right.” He sighs and bites into his lower lip. “Hannah, if that changes. If you ever find yourself able to believe that someone could care about you that much. And","if you wanted to actually . . . have dinner with that someone.” He lets out a laugh. “Well . . . Please, consider me. You know where to find me.”",61,"you decide to give love a chance, don't hesitate to reach out. I'll be here, waiting for you, no matter what. Our friendship has proven to be strong, and who knows? Maybe together we can find happiness we've both been searching for. Just remember, I'm always here for you, through thick and thin, as a friend and maybe, just maybe, something more."
“Hannah.” He gives me a skeptical look. “You have two friends who,dropped everything to be with you. And I assume sex wasn’t involved.”,24,"seem to be involved in some sort of secret or dangerous activity,” he says, folding his arms."
"“Hannah.” He unbuckles his seat belt and angles himself toward me, so that I have no choice but to look him in the eyes. He looks earnest and nearly offended. “I have thought about what happened in my office every day for the past five years. You offered to go down on me, and I just . . . embarrassed myself, and it should be the most mortifying memory I have, but for some reason it’s turned into the axis every fantasy of mine spins around, and”—he reaches up to pinch the bridge of his nose—“I want to fuck you.","Obviously. Always have. I just don’t want to fuck you once. I want to do it a lot. For a long time. I want you to come to me for sex, but also want you to come to me when you need help with your taxes and moving your furniture. I want fucking to be only one of the million things I do for you, and I want to be—” He stops. Seems to collect himself and straightens, as if to give me space. To give us space. “I’m sorry. I don’t want to crowd you. You can . . .”",201,
"He laughs, low and beautiful and a little rueful. And after looking at me like no","one else ever has before, what he says is, “Yes, Hannah. It is a yes on dinner.”",33,"one who has just realized a joke was told without them. His eyes, a deep, soulful brown, soften as he reaches out, his hand hovering before he gently cups my cheek, a silent promise of protection and warmth."
"“Um, I could make us a . . .” I scratch my head, studying the contents of my open fridge. Okay, so it’s full. The problem is, it’s full exclusively of stuff that needs to be cooked, chopped, baked, prepared. Stuff that’s healthy and doesn’t taste","particularly good. I am now 93 percent sure that Mara was the one who went shopping, because no one else would dare to impose broccoli on me. “How does one even . . . I could boil the broccoli, I guess? In a pot? With water?”",92,"to be particularly exciting. There's a mountain of fresh vegetables – carrots, bell peppers, broccoli, and spinach, all staring at me with their uncooked, slightly judgmental eyes. There's a whole chicken, waiting to be roasted, its skin glistening with the promise of crispy goodness if only I'd commit to the hours of preparation it requires. A carton of eggs sits patiently, whispering suggestions of omelets or quiches, but I've made those a million times. My mind races through the possibilities, each option more labor-intensive than the last. I could make a salad, but salads are so... basic. I could whip up a smoothie, but that feels like cheating – it's too easy, and I need to prove myself. I could attempt a stir-fry, but where's the creativity in that? I could bake a cake, but that's not exactly 'healthy.' I could make a pasta dish, but I've already had pasta twice this week. I could grill the chicken and serve it with a side of roasted vegetables, but that's just the default option. I could... wait, what if I made a curry? That's healthy, requires some effort, and is exciting enough to be interesting. I have all the ingredients: the chicken, the vegetables, some coconut milk, curry powder, and even some jasmine rice to serve it with. A curry could be adventurous, yet grounded in the familiar comfort of home cooking. I smile at the thought. That's it! I'll make a chicken curry with a medley of vegetables, infused with the aromatic spices of a traditional Thai curry. It'll be a journey through flavors, a testament to my culinary creativity, and most importantly, it'll be delicious. I grab the chicken, the vegetables, and the coconut milk, feeling a surge of excitement. This is it. This is the dish that will break the monotony of my fridge's healthy yet uninspiring contents. I start chopping, dicing, and marinating, the kitchen filling with the promise of a meal that's both nutritious and thrilling. The curry simmers on the stove, releasing its enticing aroma into the air, drawing me closer with each passing minute. This is going to be good."
“Hannah.” His forehead touches mine. He laughs against my mouth. “Dinner is . . . it’s symbolic. A,"metaphor. If you tell me that you’re willing to see where things go, I believe you, and we can—”",37,"symbolic of our journey together,"" he explains, his voice soft yet firm, as if every word carries the weight of their shared history."
"He is hot and huge. Closing his eyes, arching his neck before looking at me again with a half-warning, half-pleading expression. He finds me sitting","on his knees, his cock spasming in my grip as I lean over. “Hannah,” he says, even deeper than usual. “What are you . . .”",51,"on the edge of the bed, my expression a mix of curiosity and concern. His gaze holds a depth of unspoken stories, a complexity that makes my heart race. He slowly approaches, each step deliberate, his presence commanding yet oddly comforting. As he stands before me, the room seems to shrink around us, the outside world fading into insignificance. His hand reaches out, fingers gently brushing against my cheek, sending a shiver down my spine. In that moment, time seems to stand still, our connection palpable, yet undefined. His next words, when they come, are soft, almost a whisper, ""I need you to understand..."" His voice, a melody amidst the silence, pulls me deeper into the mystery of his being, urging me to listen beyond the words, to feel the truth behind them."
“Or maybe it’s the Vastitas Borealis.” He’s barely intelligible. Doing those little thrusts that are designed more to open me up than to,"fuck me properly, and yet we’re both this close to orgasm. It’s a little scary. “The oceans that used to fill it, Hannah.”",46,"explore. His breath is warm against my neck, and I can feel the tension in his body, a mix of excitement and something else, something deeper and more complex. I turn my head slightly, catching a glimpse of his eyes, intense and focused, reflecting the vastness of the red landscape stretching out before us. The silence between us is thick, charged with unspoken words and unexplored desires. The rover's engine hums softly in the background, a constant reminder of our isolation in this alien world. His hand, still resting on my hip, tightens its grip, pulling me closer. I can feel his heart beating against my back, a rapid drumming that syncs with the pounding of my own heart. In this moment, time seems to stand still, the universe holding its breath, waiting for us to make the next move."
