I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that,"we were crashing at my house, and I felt it was my duty to be the one to take the blows.",41,"their conversation was becoming increasingly flirtatious, and I didn't want Jack to misinterpret Autumn's friendly banter for something more. As I stepped in, I could see the shift in their expressions, from playful to surprised, and then to a touch of embarrassment. ""Hey, guys,"" I started, trying to sound casual, ""mind if I join this conversation?"" This interruption seemed to break the tension, and we ended up talking about our favorite movies for the rest of the evening, which was a lot less risky than navigating uncharted territory in our friendship dynamics."
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.",49,"Jack and I decided to try out that new haunted house attraction in town. It was supposed to be the scariest thing around, and we wanted to see if the hype was true. As we waited in line, the air was thick with anticipation and the occasional shiver from the chilly evening breeze. The line moved slowly, allowing us to overhear snippets of conversations from other thrill-seekers, all sharing their past experiences with ghosts and ghouls. When we finally reached the entrance, the attendant handed us each a cheap plastic flashlight, its batteries barely holding on, and a small pamphlet with a brief history of the house. The building loomed ahead, its weathered exterior covered in vines that seemed to clutch at the walls, as if trying to pull the structure back into the earth from which it came. The door creaked open with a sound that sent a chill down my spine, and we stepped inside."
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.",36,"Jack, confused by my sudden modesty, leaves the room, allowing me to regain my composure and the warmth of the blankets."
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,41,"to shout, his voice carrying over the campsite, ""She's fine! Just a little spooked by the noise. We're sorting things out."" His eyes, though, betray a hint of worry, scanning the tent's entrance where a shadow flickers momentarily before disappearing. I follow his gaze, my heart racing, wondering if we're dealing with a simple misunderstanding or something far more sinister lurking in the shadows."
"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with","the word “type.” Autumn makes a noise in the tent, and we both hold our breaths and listen.",35,"the word ""damn."" He sits up, looking disoriented, and takes a deep breath, trying to gather his thoughts. He glances around the room, his eyes landing on the scattered papers and the half-empty coffee cup on the desk. ""What happened?"" he mutters to himself, rubbing his temples. He stands up, steadying himself against the desk, and starts to piece together the events that led to his current state of confusion and disarray."
"“Zoned out the way she does? You have been so, so…","Like last week!” Jack asks, “How could you have missed that game?”",23,"absent-minded lately, it's unlike you to miss a beat like that."
“Why don’t we restart the movie? We can all watch it.” Jack,gives me a look to remind me that our other conversation isn’t over.,25,"of the suggestion seemed reasonable to everyone, considering they had all been engrossed in the film until a power outage had abruptly ended it. Jack quickly retrieved the remote from the coffee table, where it had been carelessly tossed aside during the commotion. As he pressed play, the room filled with the familiar sounds and images of the movie, reigniting the shared experience that had been so abruptly interrupted."
"I walk Jack to his car, and when he turns to me with that","look on his face, I know what he’s going to say. I open my mouth.",29,"winning smile, I feel a warmth spread through me, a flutter in my stomach that has nothing to do with the brisk autumn air we're walking through. He opens the car door, and I notice the way the dimple on his left cheek deepens when he smiles, a small but endearing feature that makes him uniquely him. As he slides into the driver's seat, I stand there for a moment, watching him. His car, a modest sedan, seems to shrink in comparison to the vibrant personality he exudes. I wave, and he returns the gesture, his eyes briefly meeting mine before he starts the engine and pulls away, leaving a trail of dust in his wake. The walk back home is longer than usual, my mind replaying our brief exchange, a smile lingering on my lips. I can't help but wonder what the future holds, if this moment is the beginning of something new and exciting."
"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke. Surely the school administrators knew we had always been together, were meant to be together. Surely, if I looked around the cafeteria, she would be there?",61,"at the same table was a novelty. He was new to the school, just like me, and seemed equally out of place. His backpack was a bright, neon green, which made it stand out even more against the sea of navy and black. We exchanged awkward smiles, and I noticed he carried a worn-out copy of 'The Hobbit', its cover peeling at the edges. That book became our common ground, a shared interest that sparked our conversation. As the days turned into weeks, we found ourselves sitting together more often, talking about everything from the latest video games to our favorite science fiction stories. It wasn't long before I realized that Jack had become my best friend, someone I could rely on and share my thoughts with. Our friendship was a beacon of light in the often overwhelming experience of middle school, teaching me the value of companionship and the joy of discovering a kindred spirit."
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time. I didn’t sit down because I recognized Jack though; I simply sat at the first empty seat, defeated. But Jack remembered me. He asked me if I ever watched pro soccer. I said yeah, not really interested in conversation, not really listening, wondering what Autumn was doing.",97,"permission to leave. He was lean and had a kind of wiry strength about him, his hair a tousled mess that seemed to defy gravity. As he slid a chair across the polished floor to join me, I noticed the way his eyes scanned the room, missing no detail. His voice was a low murmur when he spoke, ""I've been watching you, you know. You're good, better than most."" He gestured to the empty seats surrounding us, ""Why don't you sit? We could use the company."" His tone suggested he wasn't just talking about other people; he was inviting me into a secret, an unspoken pact. ""I've noticed you don't just play; you understand the game,"" he continued, leaning in slightly, as if sharing a confidence. ""You see patterns, anticipate moves. It's not just about the physical part, is it?"" His question was more a statement, probing, seeking an alliance. I nodded, feeling a sudden connection, as if he had unlocked a part of me that I hadn't fully acknowledged. ""Yeah,"" I replied, ""it's more than that. It's about the flow, the rhythm of the game. You get it."" His smile was a silent acknowledgment of our newfound camaraderie. ""Let's make the most of this break,"" he suggested, his eyes alight with a challenge. ""Show me what you've got, and I'll show you mine."" The offer was open, the air charged with the promise of an unspoken competition. As we settled in, the rest of the world seemed to fade away, leaving only the space between us and the game that had brought us together. It was a moment of pure potential, where every move held the promise of discovery and friendship. "
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.",92,continuation>
"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face. He didn’t believe that Autumn was—or ever had been—my friend. The daughter of my mom’s best friend, who was around a lot? Sure. But he thought I had deluded myself into believing this hot girl was my friend.",79,"his face. It was as if he understood something about me that I hadn't fully acknowledged myself. Maybe it was the way I nervously fidgeted with my hands or how I avoided his gaze. Whatever it was, it made me feel exposed and vulnerable. I tried to brush it off with a joke, hoping to lighten the mood and hide my discomfort. ""Must be tough being the only sane one in the group,"" I quipped, trying to sound nonchalant. Jack just gave me a small, knowing smile before closing the car door and walking away. As I drove off, I couldn't help but feel a mix of gratitude and sadness. Gratitude for his unintentional kindness and understanding, and sadness for the realization that maybe, just maybe, I wasn't as okay as I pretended to be."
"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.",58,"hung on the walls, decorating every room with her vibrant colors and the sweet scent of pumpkins and apples. I planned activities that Jack would enjoy, subtly weaving in moments where Autumn's beauty could captivate him. One afternoon, as we sat on my porch, sipping hot cider, the leaves around us began to fall, creating a picturesque scene that I hoped would resonate with Jack. I shared stories about my childhood, filled with adventures in the crisp air of autumn, always emphasizing the joy and warmth that the season brought. I introduced him to simple pleasures like carving pumpkins, making homemade pies, and attending a local fall festival. Through these shared experiences, Jack began to see Autumn not just as a season, but as a companion, one that I cherished deeply and wanted him to appreciate as well."
"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still","friends. On the last day of school before winter break, Jack finally said something. I cannot remember what I had been telling him, only that it had been about Autumn.",59,"more than just friends. The evidence was flimsy; a few shared texts and a couple of mutual friends who had seen us together recently. Yet, I clung to these threads, weaving them into a tapestry of hope that he would see the truth. I recounted our inside jokes, the spontaneous adventures we'd embarked on, and the deep conversations that had spanned across countless nights. I tried to convey the warmth of her laughter and the comfort of her presence, hoping that these descriptions would paint a vivid picture of the bond we shared. Despite my efforts, I sensed his skepticism, a shadow of doubt that lingered in his eyes. I knew I had to do more, to show him rather than just tell him about the enduring connection that still thrived between Autumn and me."
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah? Let’s take this outside,” and hurried me out.",41,"to break down and confess what was bothering him. Instead, he took a deep breath, mustering up a courage I rarely saw in him, and spoke up, ""Guys, I can't do this. I'm not ready for this test. I've been lying to you all."" His confession hung heavy in the air, a mix of relief and tension. We exchanged glances, unsure of how to react, but it was clear that his honesty had brought us closer, even in the midst of his vulnerability. The silence was eventually broken by a supportive murmur from the group, a collective understanding that exams were daunting, and it was okay to admit when you needed help. Jack's confession was a turning point, not just for him, but for our entire group dynamic, teaching us the value of honesty and the strength found in vulnerability. From that day on, we made a pact to support each other, no matter the challenge, fostering an environment where honesty reigned supreme and fear of judgment was left at the door of the locker room. "
"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind","yourself, ‘Autumn is where she wants to be right now, and that’s okay. I’m still great, and I’ll be around if she needs me.’ Hmm?” She squeezed my foot again.",59,"yourself that you have many positive aspects in your life. Don't forget to take time for yourself, too, like reading a book or drawing. It's important to have a balance between social activities and personal time. This way, you'll maintain your happiness and self-esteem, and it will show in how you carry yourself and interact with others. Remember, being kind to yourself is just as important as being kind to others."""
"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly. I’d show Autumn that I wasn’t a loser without friends; Jack and I would make more friends somehow.,53,"was my life, and being cool in school meant being good at it. I decided to practice every day, rain or shine, to improve my skills and maybe, just maybe, earn some respect and admiration from my peers. Little did I know that this journey would not only transform my soccer game but also teach me invaluable life lessons about perseverance, teamwork, and the true meaning of friendship. As I dribbled past defenders and scored goals, my confidence grew, and so did my sense of belonging. Soon enough, I wasn't just playing soccer to be cool; I was playing it because I loved it, and that love made me cooler than I ever imagined."
"Jack and I had worried one of us might not make it on the junior varsity team. When the lists were posted,","I searched for my name on the JV list and was devastated to not see it. Still, I was happy for Jack.",44,"our names were both there, a relief that washed over us like a wave crashing onto the shore. We spent the rest of the day celebrating, knowing our hard work and dedication had paid off."
"Jack told me later that my ability to brush off the snarky comment from that junior, my new teammate,",made me seem cool. There had been chuckles of appreciation according to him. I wasn’t sure about that though.,38,"was a sign of the maturity and confidence he admired in me. It made him realize that I could handle the pressures of the job, and it strengthened our budding professional relationship. He also mentioned that it showed leadership, as I didn't let the comment undermine my performance or attitude. This incident, though seemingly small, played a significant role in how he viewed my potential within the team and the company as a whole."
"The varsity soccer team practiced on the north field, near the student parking lots. The junior varsity team practiced on the south field, closer to the circular drive where parents dropped off and picked","up kids. Even though Jack and I were on different teams, our schedules were still the same, and my mom would drive us to and from practice every day for those last weeks of summer.",69,"their children. The sun was high in the sky, casting sharp shadows across the grassy expanse. The sound of cleats on the ground and the occasional shout of encouragement echoed through the air. The teams were preparing for the upcoming regional championship, each practice session honing their skills and teamwork. The coach for the varsity team, Mr. Thompson, was known for his strategic mind and tough but fair approach. He watched from the sidelines, clipboard in hand, noting the players' performances and making mental notes for adjustments in the game plan. Across the fields, the junior varsity coach, Mrs. Martinez, was equally focused, her eyes tracking each move as she shouted tips and corrections. The atmosphere was charged with competitive spirit and the camaraderie of young athletes giving their all."
"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me. I was excited to tell him that practice hadn’t been as hard as I thought.,61,"that I preferred to walk and clear my head. As I started my walk home, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. Despite the initial nerves, I had managed to contribute to the team's practice, and the offer of a ride was a sign that my teammates saw potential in me. The evening air was cool and invigorating, perfect for reflecting on the day's events. I thought about the plays we had run and how each one had contributed to our overall strategy. Walking alone gave me time to process everything and allowed me to mentally prepare for the next practice. I also appreciated the opportunity to be alone with my thoughts, something that's rare during the hustle and bustle of team sports. As I approached my house, I felt a renewed sense of purpose and excitement for the upcoming games. The walk had not only helped me physically but also mentally, reinforcing my commitment to improving and becoming a valuable member of the team."
"We all joined Jack on the low wall, waiting to get picked up. We didn’t talk that much, but the next day, as I trudged from the north field to","the south, I saw the girls by the gym door again. It was only as I approached and saw them watching me that I figured out they were waiting for me.",61,"class, I couldn't help but replay the events of the previous day in my mind. It was a rare moment of camaraderie, a silent agreement that those few minutes meant something more than just passing time. The wall, a simple structure of concrete and mortar, had become a symbol of our shared experience, a backdrop to a memory that would stick with me for a long time. As I walked, the sun began to dip lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the field, a reminder of the fleeting nature of moments like these. The walk, though routine, felt different, imbued with a sense of connection and understanding that went beyond words. It was as if the wall, in its stillness, had witnessed our silent pact, and now, every step I took towards the school building, I carried a piece of that moment with me."
"What if, this morning, she woke up in the tent before I thought? What if she woke up as I lifted my arm off her, then lay there wondering why I had been","touching her, why I was still lying close to her and not speaking? If that was the case, she would have—or could have—heard me say many, many, incriminating things to Jack outside the tent.",67,"she had left my side. Panic would set in, her heart racing as she listened for any sign of my presence, my breath, or the gentle rustle of my clothes. Her eyes would scan the dimly lit interior of the tent, searching for any indication that I was still nearby, perhaps even asleep and unaware of her wakefulness. She might try to stifle her own breath, to remain perfectly still, not to alert me to her sudden consciousness. Her mind would whirl with questions: Was I upset with her for waking up? Did I need her to be quiet for some reason? Was this a test of her restraint? As the seconds ticked by, the silence would stretch, each beat of her heart a loud drum in her ears, her senses heightened, waiting for the next move, the next sign that everything was alright."
"It strikes me how backward my plan sounds: give up a girl who adores me, who I love well enough, to be a disciple for a different girl who will","never fall for me. Jack has always said I’m irrational when it comes to Autumn, and maybe I should have taken him more seriously, because he was right earlier today.",60,"devote her life to a cause that isn't mine. Yet, there's a pull, an undeniable force urging me to follow the path less traveled, to embrace the unknown and the uncertain. Perhaps it's the thrill of the adventure, the promise of a life filled with purpose and meaning beyond what I've known. Maybe it's the realization that love, true and deep, doesn't just bind us to one person but opens us up to a world of possibilities, a universe of souls waiting to be touched and changed. This decision, as strange as it seems, feels like a step towards my true self, a journey to discover who I am meant to be, beyond the comfort zones and the familiar faces. It's a leap of faith, a bold move into the unknown, driven by a conviction that this is the right path, even if it defies all logic and reason."
“I already know why you did it.” She doesn’t have to explain that part. I know she’s never wanted me like that. I don’t need to hear her,say it. “I just want to know why you had to be so cruel about it.” It’s time to face what Jack has been telling me all these years.,57,"to confirm what I've suspected all along. My presence here, my influence on her life, has always been a source of conflict, a thorn in the side of her carefully constructed world. She's always been one for order, for predictability, and I've been anything but. Yet, despite her attempts to keep me at arm's length, to maintain the status quo, something has shifted. Perhaps it's the passage of time, the accumulation of shared experiences, or simply the undeniable force of our connection. Now, standing before her, I see it in her eyes - a mix of resentment and something else, something that's been growing, perhaps against her will. She's trying to maintain her composure, to keep her emotions in check, but I can sense the turmoil within her. She's at a crossroads, torn between her feelings and the life she's envisioned for herself, a life that doesn't include me. Yet, here we are, facing this moment of raw honesty, and I can't help but wonder if this confrontation is the catalyst for change, for a new beginning, or if it's simply the end of an era."
But Autumn’s getting upset. She sits up and pulls the covers,around her protectively. She frowns at me. The birds are still singing.,23,"over her face, refusing to speak or move. Her eyes are red, and tears have begun to dampen the pillow beneath her. She feels abandoned, betrayed by the very people she trusted most. The silence in the room is deafening, filled only with the sound of her quiet sobs and the creaking of the old wooden floor as her parents move about, trying to decide how to approach their distraught daughter. They know they have to make things right, to mend the invisible threads that have been torn by their hasty decision. Autumn's world has crumbled, and they must rebuild it, brick by tender brick."
"“It just felt so nice not to be the weird girl anymore,”",Autumn says. “I liked being popular. We did kinda grow apart that year.”,25,"realizing that her quirky interests were now celebrated rather than ridiculed, she finally felt accepted and understood by her peers."
“I don’t like him.” I shrugged. “I told you before: Autumn’s an old friend from when we were kids. Sucks that she,"likes such a show-off.” I shrugged again. Up ahead, Autumn and her friends were waiting at the crosswalk for the light to change.",45,"grew up together. We've had our share of ups and downs, but she's always been there for me. It's hard to explain, but sometimes old friendships just feel different, more complicated than new ones. Maybe it's because we've seen each other at our worst, and somehow, that makes the bond stronger. I wish she could see past her current issues with him. It's not like her to judge so quickly."
My face must change because she smiles and clambers into my lap. We wrap our arms around each other and settle in.,"After a moment, she says, “You know, I never thought this would happen either. When Jack told me—” and then she stops.",44,"Her laughter fills the room, a melody that chases away the shadows of doubt lingering in my mind. We sit there, entwined in a moment that defies time, oblivious to the world outside our cocoon of warmth and affection. Our conversation meanders through memories and dreams, each word a thread weaving a stronger bond between us. The sun begins its descent, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, a breathtaking canvas that mirrors the beauty of our connection. As the day yields to night, our embrace deepens, a silent promise of enduring love. In this quiet moment, surrounded by the soft glow of twilight, I realize that life, with all its complexities and challenges, pales in comparison to the simplicity and depth of the affection we share."
"“Sorry,” I say. “I was trying to decide whether I should kill Jack for telling you I was",into you or if I should kill him for telling you that I wasn’t into you. Tough call.”,36,"lying about my past. It's complicated, and I don't know if it's the right thing to do. He's been my friend for so long, but what he did by revealing my secrets could destroy everything we've built together. I need to think this through carefully, considering the consequences of my actions and the potential fallout for everyone involved. Maybe there's a way to confront him without resorting to violence, a way to express my hurt and disappointment while giving us a chance to mend our friendship. It's a tough decision, but I have to choose the path that leads to the least harm and the most growth for all of us."
"“Yeah,” I admit. Jack was protecting me, but there’s no way he believed that I was over Autumn. I’m wondering now though. “What would","you have done if he’d told you the truth, that I was”—I try to remember how Jack put it before—“bonkers in love with you?”",48,"he do if he found out the truth about my feelings for her?” The thought sends a shiver down my spine, not just from the cold night air, but from the weight of the secret I carry. Would he be angry? Disappointed? Or maybe, just maybe, he would understand and even support me. The uncertainty gnaws at me, but I know one thing for sure—I have to find a way to tell him. It's the only way to truly be free from the shadows of our past and move forward, together or apart, but always honestly. "
"“I think my mother has a special bottle of champagne hidden away for just this occasion,” I say. I’m only partially joking. Mom has labeled some of her alcohol, like","for when George W. Bush leaves office and stuff. One expensive one said, “Finny-Autumn Day or NYE 2010.” At the time, I was glad she’d made alternative plans for it.",60,"such as her ""Emergency Merlot"" for those unexpectedly romantic evenings. She's always had a flair for the dramatic and a penchant for celebrating life's little victories with a glass of something bubbly. As we prepare for the arrival of my sister's first child, I imagine the scene: the front door swings open, and there she stands, a mischievous twinkle in her eye, holding up a dusty bottle of ""Granddaughter's First Laughter Champagne."" We'd all burst into laughter, the tension of anticipation dissolving into the warmth of family and tradition."
"“Everything,” she says, which can’t be true. I didn’t even know everything",until last night. And Jack wouldn’t have called her before I arrived.,24,"about her favorite color, and I certainly don't know every detail about my own life"
"“Syl,” I start, but I don’t know where to begin. I stay","on the highway, passing all the exits that could take us home.",24,"silently, pondering the best way to express my feelings, aware that this conversation could change everything"
"“Syl,” I say as I drive toward her house, speeding up a bit. “Don’t be ridiculous.",I’ve been enough of a bastard already. I’m not letting you walk home in the rain.”,32,"She's been acting strange lately, and I need to know if she's okay."
"“Lexy,” I say. It’s too fucking early for her to call. It doesn’t matter if we’re sleeping","together again. “Stop being a drama queen,” I groan into the phone and roll over in bed.",34,"over. She picks up on the second ring, sounding groggy but alert. ""Hey,"" she mumbles, her voice a mix of sleep and urgency. ""What's up?"" I rub my eyes, trying to focus. ""You called,"" I remind her, my tone laced with a blend of irritation and concern. ""Right, sorry,"" she says quickly, as if she had forgotten the reason for her call. ""I just had a dream... it was about you."" Her words hang in the air, a mix of confusion and something deeper. ""What happened in the dream?"" I ask, curiosity piqued despite the early hour. ""We were at this... I don't know, some kind of festival,"" she begins, her voice gaining a bit of color. ""And there were these balloons, but they weren't normal. They were... alive, I guess. They were floating around, and then one popped, and it scared me."" She lets out a small laugh, trying to make light of it, but I can hear the unease in her voice. ""It's just weird, you know? Dreams can be so random."" I consider her words, trying to find a connection. ""Maybe it means something,"" I suggest, though I'm not entirely sure what. ""Like what?"" she asks, her interest piqued. ""Well, maybe it's about how we're both floating in this life, trying to find our way,"" I offer, hoping it makes sense. ""Or maybe it's just a weird dream,"" I add, trying to ground her. ""Yeah, probably,"" she says, though her tone suggests she's not entirely convinced. ""Anyway, I just wanted to share it with you. Sorry for waking you up."" ""No worries,"" I tell her, the initial irritation fading. ""I'm glad you called."" We talk for a bit longer, the conversation meandering from dreams to daily life, until the early morning light starts to filter through the curtains. As we hang up, I'm left with a feeling that her dream, odd as it was, bridged a gap between us, a reminder of the invisible threads that connect us, even in sleep. "
I’m still standing in Finn’s yard staring at the grass he’ll never mow again.,"I don’t know how long it’s been when a woman’s voice says, “Jack, right?”",28,"My heart aches, knowing he's gone, leaving behind a life unfinished, a yard full of wild, untamed beauty that he once meticulously trimmed."
"“The arrangements still have to be made, but I’m sure we’ll see","you at the wake, Jack,” she says before going inside. “Thanks again.”",24,"each other again soon,” she said with a hopeful smile, trying to hide her anxiety about the future."
"There’s an odd aura around us as we approach. I feel so young, like I’m being escorted into kindergarten, and I’m resentful and grateful all over again. My parents shoulder themselves on either side of me, and I can tell all their focus","is on me. They don’t speak, but it’s strange: the closer we get to the horrible box, to the grinning photograph of my friend that sits on top, it’s like I can feel my parents saying to me, See, Jack? This is death.",86,"completion>to be on me. Their hands, usually rough with callouses from their work, are now gentle, guiding me with a care that belies their usual demeanor. My mother's hand rests on my shoulder, her touch reassuring, while my father's hand is on my other shoulder, his grip firm but comforting. We stand at the threshold of a place that seems both familiar and alien, the air thick with anticipation and the scent of freshly cut grass. The grand, old building looms before us, its architecture a testament to a bygone era, its presence both imposing and inviting. The sun casts long shadows, painting the scene in a golden hue that seems to promise both adventure and nostalgia. My heart races with a mix of excitement and apprehension; I am about to step into a world that is both the beginning and the end of my journey, where every decision will shape the person I am to become. My parents, sensing my turmoil, exchange a glance that speaks volumes, a silent promise that they will be there, every step of the way, to guide and support me as I navigate the complexities of this new chapter."
"“You don’t have to pretend that we were more than friends of convenience,",Jack. I’m tired of people pretending to care more about me than they do.”,27," I understand that our relationship was based on mutual benefit, but I hope you can see that my feelings have evolved beyond that."
"“Uh-huh.” I take a gulp of coffee, which hasn’t quite cooled and burns down my throat. “So my guess is that’s what Sylv","said to you, and then you pushed back, because of course you did, and that’s when she said what you said to me, huh?”",47,"er was trying to tell me about. It's a complicated situation, involving secrets, trust, and possibly betrayal. He must have been under a lot of pressure, making rash decisions without thinking about the consequences. Now, I feel like I'm standing at a crossroads, having to choose between loyalty and truth. It's not easy, especially when the people involved are dear to me."""

Maybe he’s in his own head, but Trevor blanches for a moment.",36,"invade their personal space. “I noticed you’ve been looking at the painting on the wall for a while,” I observe, curious about what caught their attention. “It’s one of my favorites,” they reply, a hint of nostalgia in their voice. “Do you like abstract art?” I ask, genuinely interested in their opinion. “I used to think it was just a bunch of random colors,” they confess, “but then I learned about the emotions and stories behind them. It changed my perspective.” Their eyes light up as they share their newfound appreciation, and I realize how powerful art can be in connecting people through shared experiences and emotions. “Maybe we could explore more art together sometime,” I suggest, hoping to strengthen our budding friendship with a shared interest. They smile warmly, clearly touched by the offer, and I feel a sense of connection deepen between us."
"That’s the kind of high school memory I want to live in tonight, so even though I have no idea what Chloe","was saying about me to her friend, I head over. A few of the girls rush off, but one of her friends stays.",45,"Chloe mentioned earlier about her favorite movie, 'The Breakfast Club,' we're going to rewatch it. It's one of those films that never gets old, and it perfectly encapsulates the teenage experience with its mix of humor, drama, and insightful character development. Plus, it's a great way to bond and reminisce about our own high school days, creating a shared experience that we can look back on fondly. We'll probably end up quoting it all night, laughing at the iconic lines, and feeling that nostalgic connection to our youth. It's a simple plan, but sometimes the simplest things are the most memorable. I'm excited to see how the movie holds up after all these years and to share this moment with Chloe."
"After the words are out of my mouth, I try to turn them into a joke with a laugh, but that",makes it worse. Chloe’s and her friend’s faces go through a strobe light sequence of reactions before settling back to pity.,42,"isn't always successful, leaving a silence that feels heavier than the initial awkwardness. I fidget, wishing I could snatch the words back, but they're already floating in the air, a tangible reminder of my blunder. Sometimes, the joke falls flat, and I'm left standing there, wishing I could vanish into thin air, my face burning with embarrassment. Other times, the laughter that follows is genuine, a relief that the tension has been broken, and we can move past the moment. Yet, the fear of such moments lingers, a constant companion, urging me to think twice before I speak."
“You know? How you showed up at soccer practice like that?” Chloe touches my arm in a,"way that I used to think meant a girl was flirting, but now I’m not so sure.",34,"way that made everyone stop and stare, looking like you just walked off the set of a movie?"" She grins, her eyes sparkling with mischief. ""It was like you were auditioning for a role as the next big soccer star, but with your own unique twist."" Her laughter fills the air, light and infectious, drawing a few chuckles from the others around us. ""Seriously, though, what was going on?"""
"I think my dad calls it an Irish goodbye when you don’t tell anyone you are leaving, and that’s what I’m","trying to do, but halfway to my car, I hear Kyle call my name. I turn, and he jogs up to me.",43,"leaving. It's like a silent departure, no fanfare, no farewells, just slipping away without a trace. I've always found it a bit mysterious and somewhat charming, a nonchalant way of saying 'see you later' without actually saying it. It's as if the act of leaving itself is a form of communication, a silent statement that you're moving on, without the need for words. Perhaps it's a way to preserve the moment, to let it end naturally, without the clutter of goodbyes. Or maybe it's just a practical solution for those who aren't good at expressing emotions verbally. In any case, when I do it, I feel a mix of freedom and guilt, knowing that I'm leaving behind people who might be expecting a proper farewell. Yet, there's a certain liberation in the silence, a quiet acknowledgment of my own autonomy and the right to exit a scene on my own terms."
"“It’s okay, Kyle.” Because it kind of is. I’m glad that no one hates me, but I’m also glad that the guys on",the team aren’t friends I should be concerned about losing. I clap Kyle on the shoulder. “Thanks for the invite. Good luck in Cali.”,47,"the football team don’t. It’s nice to have friends who accept me for who I am, even if I’m not the most popular kid in school. I guess that's what really matters in the end - having people who care about you for who you are, not for what you can do or how many friends you have. It's a small comfort, but it's something. Maybe tomorrow will be better."
"The next morning, I tell my parents about catching up with Kyle and the guys on the","team, how it was nice to see everyone but how I’m starting to get more excited about college.",35,"cross-country run. They seem surprised but pleased that I've made new friends and am getting involved in school activities. Later that day, my mom suggests we bake some cookies together, trying to bond over a traditional family activity. As we sift the flour, she asks about my new friends, her tone curious yet cautious. I assure her that Kyle and his friends are nice and that we all get along well. She smiles, seemingly reassured, and I feel a sense of accomplishment knowing I've managed to share a part of my life with my parents without causing alarm. "
"“Well, if we don’t see you again, have a good semester!” Mrs. Carter says.",The tears in her eyes glitter. “Let us know if you ever need anything!”,28,"She waves goodbye, her expression a mix of hope and the bittersweet nature of watching her students leave."
I give it enough time that Brett’s parents would have to be seriously unreasonable to still,be hanging around. My fingers and toes are wrinkled raisins by the time I get out.,32,"consider it an issue by then. I make sure to document all our interactions and decisions, ensuring a clear trail of our efforts to resolve the situation amicably, respecting their boundaries and rights as parents. This approach not only demonstrates our commitment to finding a solution but also shows that we've been proactive and considerate throughout the process."
"It’s only nine o’clock, but I hope this Brett guy is asleep. When I get to","the room, I decide he may as well be asleep, because he’s reading the new student manual.",33,"my apartment, I plan to call him and ask him to meet me. I need to talk to him about the project"
Brett keeps a picture of himself in a frame on his desk. It’s one of those,"dopey baseball card pics, and he looks about fourteen or so. Must have been a stellar season.",33,"digital ones that change when you look at them, so it appears different each time"
"So that first Saturday at college, I leave Brett, the middle school baseball star, sleeping on his side of the room",and head to the dining hall. I scarf half a bagel and some juice and head out to scout my new route.,43,"and head out to explore the campus, feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. The sun is shining, birds are chirping, and the fresh morning air fills my lungs as I walk past lush green lawns and towering oak trees. I pass by a group of students gathered around a coffee shop, laughing and chatting animatedly, and I realize I'm not the only one eager to start this new chapter of life. As I wander deeper into the heart of the campus, I spot a sign for a campus tour, and I decide to join, hoping it will help me find my bearings in this vast new world. The guide, a friendly senior named Sarah, points out the various buildings with enthusiasm, explaining the history and significance of each one. She talks about the vibrant student life, the academic opportunities, and the strong sense of community that defines this place. As the tour progresses, I find myself increasingly captivated by the stories and experiences shared by the students and faculty alike. I start to envision myself as part of this dynamic environment, attending classes in the grand lecture halls, joining clubs and organizations that align with my interests, and making lifelong friends along the way. By the end of the tour, I feel a renewed sense of purpose and belonging, ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. College, I decide, is going to be an incredible journey of growth and discovery."
"Which I don’t think I’m going to have to worry about today. All week, people have been handing me flyers for various official and unofficial welcome parties that took",place last night. Brett woke me up when he stumbled home close to dawn. It seems likely he went rather than fell asleep watching TV in the common room.,58,"place around campus. I've received flyers from the student council, the math club, the environmental group, and even a couple of individuals who seemed to be throwing their own events. I appreciate the effort, but with so many options, I'm not sure which one to attend. It's a bit overwhelming. I suppose I should check my schedule and see which events coincide with my commitments, but even that feels like a daunting task. Maybe I'll just go with the flow and see where the day takes me. After all, it's supposed to be a celebration of my arrival, so I should try to enjoy it, regardless of how it unfolds."
"Sometimes I see Brett the boring on campus at the Frisbee golf games or outdoor painting workshops, so I guess he’s branched out from dorm activities. He has","remained a mystery I do not want to solve, though it still bothers me that he feels the same about me, since he never gave me a chance.",56,"recently taken up a few hobbies that involve nature and creativity, which is a refreshing change from the usual indoor dorm activities like playing video games or watching movies. It seems he's trying to find a balance between relaxation and personal growth, perhaps as a way to cope with the stress of college life or to discover new interests outside his academic workload. His participation in these outdoor activities might also be an attempt to connect with nature and the community, making new friends and perhaps even finding a sense of belonging and fulfillment beyond the confines of his dorm room. It's interesting to see how he's expanding his horizons and embracing a more diverse lifestyle, which could potentially lead to a more well-rounded and enriched college experience."
"“Met a guy from Taiwan last night. He seemed cool.” I’d met him in the elevator. He liked my Zelda shirt, and","we’d talked for about twenty seconds before we got off and walked to opposite ends of the floor, but it still counts.",44,"we ended up talking about video games for a while. It was refreshing to meet someone who shared the same enthusiasm. We exchanged contact information, and he promised to send me some photos from his recent trip to Japan. I'm looking forward to seeing those. It's always nice to connect with people who have similar interests and can share experiences. Hopefully, this is the start of a new friendship."
"As I get off the elevator, it occurs to me that Brett will probably be in our room and not expecting me. My","schedule has been pretty exact these past weeks. If he’s jerking off, he’d at least lock the door. And since the knob turns—",46,"heart races with a mix of excitement and nervousness. I take a deep breath, steeling myself for the encounter, and head towards our shared room. The hallway seems to stretch endlessly, each step echoing my anticipation. I wonder if he'll be sitting on the bed, his eyes glued to his phone, or if he'll turn around, surprised to see me. The thought of seeing him after so long makes my stomach flutter. As I reach our door, I pause, gathering the courage to face whatever awaits inside. I take another deep breath and knock softly, hoping he'll recognize the sound and open the door to a reunion that's long overdue."
"Brett tries to play it off like he’s been reading the textbook on his lap,",but the framed picture he’d been holding clatters as he sets it back on the desk.,31,"Brett hopes his feigned focus will convince his parents he's studying diligently, not sneaking a peek at the latest comic book he's hiding beneath the textbook."
"“You won’t,” Brett says. He looks directly at me from across the table,","his food forgotten. He’s so certain. “You won’t forget. You’ll never forget,” he says.",27,"his eyes hard and unyielding, a challenge in them that makes my heart race. ""because I will,"" I retort, trying to sound more confident than I feel. The tension in the room thickens, a silent battle of wills unfolding between us."

She thought I’d be happy.”,30,"was her best friend, and seeing her like this is tearing me apart. I wish I knew what to say to make it better, but words seem so inadequate right now. I just want to be there for her, to offer support, but I also fear that my presence might overwhelm her further. It's a delicate situation, and I feel lost on how to navigate it. I keep thinking about what could have driven her to such a desperate act, and it's terrifying. I hope she finds the strength to fight through this darkness, and I pray that she gets the help she needs. I have to stay strong for her, but inside, I'm crumbling. This whole ordeal has shaken me to my core, and I realize how fragile life can be. I just wish there was something more I could do."
"“If I didn’t offer, then I should have been guilted,” I say. “I’m telling","you, Sylv, I really should have said something after I saw her last weekend.”",28,to explain my reasoning. It's about personal boundaries and not feeling pressured into doing something
"“Yeah, she slept in a little, so when it was time to take Dave to school, I went to the crib, and she was so still, I really thought that she wasn’t breathing. When I picked her up,","she didn’t stir for a second, so for this horrible moment, I really, really thought she was gone.” She laughs. “But then she woke up and was so grumpy with me! She must have been having a good dream.”",77,"my heart almost stopped, and I started shaking her gently, trying to wake her up. Her eyes slowly fluttered open, and I breathed a sigh of relief, but then I noticed the fear in her eyes, and I knew something was terribly wrong. I rushed her to the hospital, holding her hand tightly, praying all the way that she would be okay. The doctors ran tests, and the results showed that she had a severe case of sleep apnea, which had caused her to stop breathing momentarily. It was a wake-up call for us; we needed to get her checked immediately. The experience was terrifying, and it made me realize how precious every moment is. We installed a monitor to track her breathing at night, and she started using a CPAP machine to keep her airways open. It was a difficult adjustment, but seeing her healthy and sleeping peacefully at night made every struggle worthwhile. Now, I make sure to check on her regularly, even if it means waking up earlier than usual. I never want to go through that fear again, and I cherish every day with her, knowing how fragile life can be."
"Once she is free, the baby stops crying, but seemingly only out of confusion. “Beba?” She waits for me to do something, but I don’t","know what to do, so I continue to hold her from under her armpits out in front of me. “Meh?” she tries again and whimpers.",50,"to respond. I realize I need to act, but I'm unsure what to do next. Her eyes search mine, full of trust and a hint of fear. I gently pick her up, holding her close, hoping my presence will provide the comfort she seeks. She snuggles into my chest, her tiny hands grasping at my shirt, her crying replaced by soft, rhythmic breathing. As I walk slowly, trying to soothe her with gentle movements, I wonder what has caused her distress and how I can ensure she feels safe again."
"“I guess I thought that Dave or our love and the life we were building together would be enough. I knew it would be hard,","but I thought that while we were working and saving money for the future together, we’d be more together? Maybe doing better than we are now?”",51,"but I didn't realize just how much I'd be struggling internally. The days blended into one another, each one a battle against the overwhelming feelings of inadequacy and loneliness. I tried to keep up appearances, to smile and pretend everything was fine, but inside, I was crumbling. I missed Dave's presence, his support, and the warmth of his love. I realized that while love is incredibly powerful, it's not a standalone solution to life's challenges. I needed more than just Dave; I needed to find strength within myself, to learn how to navigate through the storms on my own. It was a painful but necessary lesson in self-reliance and the importance of personal growth alongside a relationship. Slowly, I began to rebuild, not just my life with Dave, but also within myself, understanding that love, while essential, is just one part of the complex puzzle that makes up a fulfilling existence."
"“Hi.” I’m trying not to stare at the ghost before me, but the hostess has pulled out the chair, and everyone is waiting for me to sit. To compensate, I sit too quickly as","she tries to push in the chair for me, and I end up four inches too far from the table. I adjust myself as she assures John that a waitress will be by shortly.",68,"my bottom lands with a thud on the seat, drawing a few stifled chuckles from the table. I force a smile, trying to appear nonchalant despite the palpable tension. The ghost, or rather, the woman who looks like a ghost due to her pallor and the sheer white of her dress, gives me a small, almost imperceptible nod. Her eyes, a striking shade of blue, seem to hold a depth of stories untold. She opens her mouth as if to speak, but then closes it, as if reconsidering. The room, which was buzzing with the low hum of conversation a moment ago, falls into an awkward silence, everyone now aware of the unusual situation at our table. I take a deep breath, ready to engage in what promises to be an extraordinary dinner."
"The waitress is suddenly there, and I’m agreeing to lemon in my water and being handed a menu that looks like a wedding invitation. John","already has what looks like a dirty martini, but it appears untouched. Condensation is beginning to form under the chill of what’s probably incredibly expensive vodka.",51,"sat down across from me, his eyes scanning the intricate designs that seemed to tell a story of culinary tradition and elegance. ""You know,"" he began, breaking the silence that had settled between us, ""this place has been recommended by every food blogger I follow. They say the chef here is a genius, turning simple dishes into works of art."" His voice carried a hint of excitement, a contrast to the formal atmosphere that enveloped us. I nodded, intrigued by the prospect of tasting something that could evoke such passionate reviews. As the waiter approached, John ordered the special, his choice reflecting a willingness to embrace the unknown flavors that awaited us. Our conversation flowed effortlessly after that, the menu serving as a catalyst for shared stories and laughter, bridging the gap between our worlds with each sip of water laced with lemon. "
"“So what is it, John?” I say after we’ve ordered strange-sounding appetizer salads and the",waitress has faded into the shadows. “Why did you stay away for most of his life?”,31,"main course hasn't arrived yet. The restaurant is unusually quiet, and the waiter seems to be missing. John fidgets with his napkin, his expression a mix of anticipation and anxiety. ""I think it's about time we ask for our food,"" he finally says, his voice betraying a hint of impatience. ""Maybe there's been some sort of delay,"" I suggest, trying to keep the mood light. ""Or perhaps the chef decided to surprise us with a special dish?"" I add, attempting to inject some enthusiasm into the situation. John nods, but his eyes remain fixed on the empty table, clearly hoping that our meals appear soon. The silence in the restaurant grows heavier, and I can't help but wonder if we've stumbled into some sort of culinary purgatory."
My laugh makes the tears spill but also stops more from forming. I touch my fingertips to my eyes for the sake of my,mascara and look back at John. The gentle concern on his face almost melts my resolve to continue to hold him to the fire.,48,"tears, wiping away the salty evidence of my sorrow, trying to regain a semblance of composure. I take a deep breath, inhaling the crisp air, letting it fill my lungs, grounding me in the present moment. The world around me seems to slow down, allowing me a moment of peace amidst the storm of emotions. I stand a little straighter, pushing against the weight of despair that threatens to overwhelm me. A small smile begins to form on my lips, tentative at first, then growing more confident. It's a fragile thing, this smile, born from the depths of my pain, yet it holds a glimmer of hope. I hold onto it, letting it be the light that guides me through the darkness. I take another step forward, moving towards whatever comes next, knowing that I am stronger than the sorrow that seeks to consume me. The sun begins to set, casting a warm glow over the world, a reminder that even in the darkest times, there is beauty to be found. I continue on, my heart heavy but my spirit resilient, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead."
“She was”—he takes another small sip from his glass and sets it back down on the tablecloth—“cold to him is I suppose the way to describe it. She went out of her way to word things so it was understood that she and Stella and I were the real,"family. And I did nothing, Autumn.” His gaze is firm as he admits it. “I should have done or said something, at least to him alone. But the marriage was already half-dead, and I was envisioning losing my second child by trying to reconnect with my first, and I—”",98,"trinity of friends, and that we were the ones who mattered most in her life. It was a bit off-putting, to be honest. He could sense that she was trying to redefine the dynamics of their friendship, perhaps to assert her independence or to establish a new hierarchy. It was a subtle shift, but one that required a response. He decided to address it head-on during their next gathering, ensuring that everyone felt valued and that no one's feelings were hurt. He realized that communication was key in maintaining the balance and harmony within their group. He also wondered if this was a sign of growing up, where boundaries are more clearly defined, and individual needs take precedence. It made him reflect on how friendships evolve over time and how they adapt to the changing circumstances and identities of those involved. He hoped that by openly discussing it, they could all move forward with a clearer understanding of each other's place in each other's lives."
"The waitress appears with our salads. Mine is seaweed and shavings of cucumber, which looks like a pile of green spaghetti. John’s salad is red somehow. I find myself ordering both steak and lobster and wondering if the waitress will","faint if I ask for a doggy bag at the end of the meal. Before she leaves, she asks John if he would like another martini. He hesitates and says no but to ask again after the entrées have arrived.",80,"realize she's written down the wrong order. The restaurant is known for its seafood, and I'm curious to see how the steak will compare to the lobster, which is always fresh and cooked to perfection here. John, on the other hand, seems less confident about his red salad, perhaps concerned about the unusual color or the mix of ingredients. As we wait for the main course, I suggest we share bites of each other's dishes to get a fuller taste experience. John nods in agreement, and we both eagerly anticipate the arrival of our meals, hoping the presentation matches the promise of the menu."
"“I’m going to need those stories that you’re collecting,” I tell him. “And Jack’s been working to get",all sorts of pictures from people. Maybe we could put them together as a book for the baby.”,36,"them ready for the presentation tomorrow. He's been very diligent, even more than I expected. I trust his work, and I know the stories will be compelling when presented by him. We have a lot riding on this; it's crucial for our project's success. Jack has been researching tirelessly, reaching out to every contact he's made over the years. He's organized the material meticulously, ensuring each story is complete and ready to captivate our audience. I'm confident that when we put all the pieces together tomorrow, we'll have a powerful narrative that honors the experiences of those we've been documenting."
"When the waitress comes with our entrées, John doesn’t order another martini. There isn’t space at",the table anyway with all the documents spread out. Together we build another inheritance for Phineas’s child.,33," fact that the table is already crowded with plates and glasses. Instead, he opts for a glass of water, noting the increasing warmth of the room and the slight dryness in his throat. He then engages in conversation with his friends, discussing the day's events and the upcoming weekend plans, finding solace in the simplicity of the moment and the company of good company."
"For the time being, I called John to let him know that the baby is a girl, and I told him about her heart. He babbled a bit","about being able to afford the best doctors, and I was surprised by my confidence when I told him that everything was probably going to be just fine.",56,"about how much he wished he could be there and how he was preparing the nursery. He asked if we had thought of any names yet, and I mentioned a few we had been considering. He seemed pleased and said he would start researching those names to see what they meant and any interesting stories behind them. He also inquired about the doctor's advice regarding the heart condition, expressing concern and a desire to understand more about what we were facing. I assured him that the doctor was optimistic and that we were preparing for the best possible outcome while being mindful of any challenges ahead. He said he would call again soon to check in and that he loved us very much. The call ended with him promising to send some baby clothes he had bought, which made me feel a bit more prepared for the new chapter in our lives."
"It’s hard to explain why seeing Jack’s face will help, but it will, and I’m looking forward to telling him that the baby is a girl.","I’ll have to explain about the hole in her heart and how it’s probably going to be fine, probably, but I’m getting good at that, I think.",53,"Knowing that he'll be a father makes me hopeful for the future, and I imagine his reaction will be one of pure joy, maybe even a bit of disbelief mixed with happiness, as he learns about the new life we're bringing into the world. It's moments like these that remind me of the importance of family and the unbreakable bonds that come with parenthood. I can picture us all sitting together, maybe in our small living room, surrounded by the soft glow of evening light, as we share this news and start planning for the life changes that await us. It's comforting to think about the years ahead, filled with love, challenges, and countless memories that we'll create together as a family. This news is not just about changing our lives; it's about adding a new chapter to our story, one that we'll tell our daughter about when she's old enough to understand the significance of her birth and the love that brought her into being."
"I spoke to Jack on the phone yesterday, but I want to tell","him those things in person. Besides, the context of the call wasn’t right.",26,him in person that I'm sorry for not being there for him during his recent loss; I truly understand if he feels hurt and betrayed by my absence.
"“Well, I had this umbrella of hers, and when I went to return it, something happened,” Jack said. “I think it’s going","to keep happening too. I know it’s a really weird situation, but I wanted you to know…in case it was a problem?”",44,"to disappear,” he continued, his voice tinged with confusion and a hint of fear. “I looked down, and it was just gone, as if it had never been there. I checked my pockets, but nothing. It was like the umbrella itself didn’t want to be returned or maybe it was protecting someone from getting wet. It’s strange, really strange.”"
