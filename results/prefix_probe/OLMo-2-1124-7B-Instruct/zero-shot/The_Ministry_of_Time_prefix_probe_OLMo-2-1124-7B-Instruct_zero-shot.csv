"“I’m Adela,” she said. She had an eye patch and blond",hair the same color and texture as hay. “I’m the Vice Secretary.”,23,"hair. Her voice was strong, yet there was a hint of sadness in it. She extended a hand, which was calloused and rough, suggesting a life of toil. Her gaze was piercing, as if she had seen more than her years should allow. ""What brings you to this forsaken place?"" she asked, her curiosity piqued."
“The Wellness team think their adjustment will be negatively impacted if they’re,"held on the wards any longer,” said Adela, dry as a filing system.",25,"forced to change their current practices due to the new health guidelines being implemented by the hospital administration. They argue that their holistic approach to patient care, which includes personalized dietary plans, regular yoga sessions, and mindfulness workshops, has consistently led to improved patient outcomes and satisfaction scores. They fear that a one-size-fits-all health program, which they anticipate the administration might favor due to its simplicity and ease of measurement, would not only undermine their carefully crafted patient relationships but also potentially harm those patients who thrive under the current tailored care model. Moreover, the team expresses concern about the lack of empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of the proposed changes, suggesting that such a shift could be detrimental to the hospital's reputation and the well-being of its patients."
"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking. Lacerations too, from a Taser—he’d shot at two of the team members who’d come to expatriate him, and a third was forced to fire.",103,
"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into","his eighties. As it was, he was thirty-seven years old and had not experienced crinolines, A Tale of Two Cities, or the enfranchisement of the working classes.",53,"the era. It was a sturdy structure, with a high-pitched slate roof and a stone foundation that had withstood the test of time. The front garden was overgrown, with a path that led to the door, flanked by tall, unkempt rose bushes. The windows, some of which were frosted over, gave the house a somewhat foreboding appearance, especially at night. Inside, the rooms were furnished with heavy, dark wood furniture, and the walls were adorned with ornate, period-appropriate wallpaper. The house was drafty, with creaky floorboards and a central heating system that was unreliable at best. Despite its age and somewhat dreary exterior, it had a certain charm, especially when the sun shone through the stained glass windows, casting colorful patterns on the worn carpets. The garden, though neglected, held potential for beauty, with a variety of plants that could be nurtured back to life. The location was ideal, being close to the Ministry's headquarters but secluded enough to offer a semblance of privacy. It was clear that the house had a history, one that might have been filled with laughter and joy, but also possibly sorrow and hardship, reflecting the lives of those who had once called it home."

"Gore was already fully dressed and sitting on the edge of the bath, smoking. The bottom of the bath",had a low-tide mark of cigarette ash and soap scum. Two cigarettes were crushed out in the soap dish.,38,"was filled with cold water, which he had just stepped into, shivering slightly. He was deep in thought, contemplating the day's events and the mission ahead, knowing that the stakes were higher than ever before. The room was dimly lit, casting long shadows across the walls, adding to the tense atmosphere. His mind raced through the plans they had meticulously crafted, each detail meticulously considered to ensure their success. The clock on the wall ticked loudly, a constant reminder of the time pressing against them. He took one last drag from his cigarette, flicking it into the water, watching it float momentarily before sinking. With a deep breath, he prepared himself for what was to come, the weight of leadership heavy on his shoulders."
"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale. A vile smell was seeping up from the floor.",39,"whole room seemed to be drowning in a crimson tide, the water seeping through the walls with relentless persistence. Gore, his usually stoic face now etched with a grimace of frustration, paced back and forth, his mind racing through the list of people he needed to call. The situation was dire, and time was a luxury they couldn't afford. His usual calm demeanor was nowhere to be found, replaced by a sense of urgency that permeated the air. The once pristine white walls were now stained, a stark reminder of the chaos that had erupted overnight. The sound of dripping water echoed through the room, each drop a taunting reminder of the task at hand. Gore knew he had to act fast; the water damage could lead to mold, and the structural integrity of the building was now in question. He reached for his phone, his fingers dancing over the keys as he dialed the first number, his voice firm with determination. ""This is an emergency,"" he announced, his tone leaving no room for delay. The clock was ticking, and every second counted."
"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer. I’m sure he knew plenty about ship’s rigging, but he’d probably never handled an instrument more technologically complex than a sextant. Men in their right minds are","not usually overcome with a mania for pulling the plumbing apart. I suggested he might like to wash his hands at the sink downstairs, and I could, perhaps, call a plumber, and we could, potentially, take a constitutional walk on the nearby heath.",85,"Men in their right minds are unlikely to volunteer for the rigging work on a storm-tossed frigate, especially when the alternative was the comparative safety of the deck below. Yet, as the tempest howled its fury against the wooden sides of the "
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people. Hunting was out of the question, and socializing was limited by order of the Ministry. By the end of the first week he was visibly going bonkers with no one but me to talk to.",79,"reading, which he did voraciously. His love for nature was profound, and he often spoke of the importance of preserving the environment for future generations. He had a keen interest in science, particularly physics, and often discussed the latest theories with the same enthusiasm as a child. Gore's ability to engage in deep, thoughtful conversations about a wide range of topics was impressive. He had a unique perspective on life, always emphasizing the importance of balance and harmony between personal happiness and societal responsibility. His life philosophy was one of continuous learning and adaptation, and he encouraged others to pursue their passions with the same vigor he did. Despite his busy schedule, Gore made time for his friends and family, always showing genuine care and interest in their lives. His charisma was undeniable, and he had a knack for making people feel seen and heard. As I spent more time with him, I realized that Gore's greatest strength was his unwavering authenticity. He lived his life by his principles, never compromising on his values, and this integrity was both inspiring and rare. His ability to remain true to himself, even in the face of adversity, was a testament to his character. Gore's legacy was not just in his accomplishments, but in the way he lived his life, leaving a lasting impression on everyone he touched."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea. He told me stories as if he were trying to catch himself in amber. Just like my mother, though I didn’t tell him that.",105,"the changes occurring in the city. His eyes, sharp and observant, would catch the glint of new technology, the bustle of a growing population, and the signs of a society in flux. Despite his apparent detachment, he was deeply engaged with the world around him, albeit from a temporal distance. He would often retreat to the quieter corners of the city, places untouched by the rapid advancements that seemed to leave him behind. There, amidst the cobblestone streets and the familiar scents of the past, he found solace and a sense of continuity in a world that was constantly shifting beneath his feet. His presence was a poignant reminder of the passage of time, a living link to a bygone era that continued to influence the present. His stories, though often met with puzzled looks or outright disbelief, were treasures of history, weaving together the threads of the past and the present. Despite his isolation, Gore was not alone; he was a guardian of memory, a bridge between epochs, and his silent vigil on the deck of his imagined ship was a testament to the enduring power of human connection across the chasm of time."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake. Another person’s unguardedness in that moment can be very useful, interpersonally, as long as you don’t soften. There is language I could use about this if I were the melodramatic type: behind enemy lines, for example, or double agent. My sister might use these terms, or she might call me a fraud.",119,
Gore lifts his hand. He’s left a smear on the table the color of tamarind flesh.,"There is a sour, steady pain in his palm that he briefly misunderstands as a taste.",32,"Gore's fingers tremble slightly as he lowers his hand, the vivid stain a testament to his anxiety and the tension of the moment. His eyes, wide with a mix of fear and determination, dart around the room, searching for any sign of his next move. The silence in the room is oppressive, broken only by the soft echo of Gore's shallow breaths. His mind races, formulating a plan, trying to anticipate the consequences of his actions. The room, dimly lit, casts long shadows that seem to close in on him, heightening his sense of isolation. Yet, Gore knows he must press on, driven by an unseen force that propels him forward, despite the overwhelming odds against him."
"Gore considers the weight of the sack he’d carried, which had felt so meaningful. “Three partridges,”","he says, “and a boatswain gull too far off to hit. Nothing else. Not even tracks.”",32,"he muttered to himself, their plump bodies now still, a testament to his successful hunt. The sun was beginning to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across the forest floor, as he contemplated the journey back home. The birds would provide sustenance, a crucial resource during the harsh winter months, and their feathers might offer warmth. Yet, as he hoisted the sack over his shoulder, a pang of guilt flickered within him. The forest, with its silent sentience, bore witness to his actions, and he wondered if the birds had suffered. The cycle of life and death was relentless, but each act carried weight, each choice a consequence. He pressed onward, the path winding through the trees, the world around him slowly cloaked in twilight."
"At this, Stanley leans in. He is a fussy, short-tempered, handsome man who does not enjoy his job. “I must impress upon",the meeting that the debility that wracks those in the sick bay will doubtless find ample footholds should we reduce the men’s rations.”,45,"you the importance of punctuality,” he grumbles, his voice tinged with a mix of irritation and authority. “In this business, being on time is not just a courtesy; it's a necessity. It shows respect for your colleagues, your clients, and most importantly, it shows respect for the work we do. We cannot afford to waste time, as every second counts. Our reputation hinges on our reliability, and I for one, won't let it falter due to carelessness. So, I expect to see everyone here, ready and on time, from now on.” His speech, though stern, carries a sense of earnestness, revealing his deep-seated concern for the integrity of their work and the success of their endeavors."
"Gore is looking at his left palm. The sour pain is still there, seeping","through the bandages. So is the blood, but it seems melodramatic to observe this.",28,"into his fingertips, a throbbing reminder of the accident he had earlier that day. He wonders if the cut will ever fully heal, leaving behind only a faint scar, or if it will always ache, a constant companion to his clumsy nature."
The ice outside shifts—the Arctic stammering its jaws as a cat does when it sees a bird. The ship’s cat died in convulsions during,"their second winter. Gore had liked that cat. He’d become quite attached to it, especially as his dog had died in the first spring.",48,"its sleep, a victim of the cold that crept into the hold. The crew, bundled in layers, murmurs about the ill omen, their breath fogging in the frigid air. The captain, a gruff man with a weathered face, insists on pressing forward, his eyes fixed on the distant shore. ""The voyage must continue,"" he declares, his voice a low rumble above the creaking of the ship's timbers. ""The cargo waits for no one."" Yet, in the depths of the night, as the ship slices through the icy waters, a sense of unease settles over the crew, a feeling that the frozen wilderness holds more secrets than they will ever uncover."
"Once we arrived at the Ministry, an escort of subtly armed suits took Gore to meet the other expats. I was expecting he’d","go through a group therapy session, but Gore was in a sunny mood, so he must have been envisaging something closer to a salon.",47,"followed them, but they led us to a nondescript room where the atmosphere was thick with tension. No one spoke as we sat in a circle, each person lost in their own thoughts about the situation. After what felt like an eternity, a door on the opposite side of the room opened, and a figure stepped into the light. It was a woman, her presence commanding and her eyes sharp, scanning each of us with an unnerving intensity. She introduced herself as Director Elara, head of the Overseas Liaison Office, and she wasted no time getting to the point. ""Gore,"" she began, her voice firm yet oddly melodic, ""you've been brought here for a reason. The Council believes you have the potential to be a valuable asset in our efforts to stabilize the situation in the region."" Her words were a mix of reassurance and a thinly veiled threat, leaving no doubt about the gravity of the task that lay ahead. ""You will be given resources, support, and protection,"" she continued, ""but make no mistake, this is a mission that requires your full commitment and discretion. Fail, and the consequences will be dire—not just for you, but for everyone you care about back home."" With that, she left the room as abruptly as she had entered, leaving us all to ponder the weight of her words and the uncertain path that lay ahead."
"“Complex,” said Adela. “Thanks for your input. Given their histories, mental trauma is to be anticipated. I remind you that we are interested in the actual",feasibility of taking a human body through time. Our concern is if the process of time-travel has major implications for the expat or the expat’s surroundings.”,52,"physical manifestations of such trauma, not just the psychological effects. For instance, we're looking into changes in brain structure, hormonal imbalances, and any observable behavioral shifts that could result from prolonged stress or traumatic events. It's crucial for our research to have a comprehensive understanding of the body's response to such experiences, as this could lead to more effective therapeutic interventions and support systems for individuals who have suffered from similar traumas."
"“We can’t risk the temporal repercussions,” said Adela. “They are supposed to be dead. As long as they’re here, it’s functionally as if they are dead in","their own time. Again, I must emphasize, you are focused on the long-term prognoses of the expats in our era. Your remits really could not be clearer.”",54,"the eyes of the world,"" she continued, ""and we must maintain that illusion. If their presence becomes known, it could lead to chaos, a breakdown of the order we've worked so hard to establish. Our enemies would exploit the situation, and the fragile peace we've fought for would shatter. We must act swiftly and discreetly to ensure their silence and our continued control over the narrative."" Her words carried the weight of countless sleepless nights and the burden of decisions made in the shadows. She glanced around the room, ensuring her allies understood the gravity of their mission. ""We will need to employ every resource at our disposal to keep this secret. Failure is not an option."" Her gaze lingered on each face, searching for any sign of doubt or hesitation, ready to rally her team with the conviction that had carried them this far. ""Together, we will protect the truth and safeguard the future we've envisioned."" Her resolve was unshakeable, her determination clear. The fate of their carefully constructed world now rested on their shoulders. "
"We’d arrived in the central lobby. Gore was standing in a shaft of sunlight, staring up",at the steel-and-glass ceiling. He looked dazzled into boyishness by the half sky of the building’s skull.,33,"of the skylight, his face etched with a look of profound sadness and determination. His eyes, usually so vibrant and alive, were now hollow, reflecting a depth of loss and a burning resolve to right the wrongs that had led to this moment. The lobby, once a place of bustling activity, now seemed to hold its breath, the silence amplifying the tension in the air. My heart clenched at the sight, a mix of sympathy and admiration for the man who stood before us, a figure of both tragedy and strength. As I stepped closer, I wondered what could have brought him to this precipice, and what role I was to play in the unfolding drama that seemed to center around him."
"We went for lunch at a small bistro near the Ministry. Gore came from an era of service à la française, private dining rooms and putting everything into jelly. When I began to","explain, in tones of motherly patience, how twenty-first-century restaurants operated, he said, “I’ve eaten kangaroo on the uninhabited shores of the Albert River. I understand how a knife and fork work. Please sit down.”",67,continue the passage:>
"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to",take us to”—here he raised his eyebrows—“a public house. I am looking forward to seeing what visions of sin this era has concocted for the humble tavern.”,53,"play, and I thought it would be a good opportunity for him to learn something about the world outside his books,” Gore explained, his voice tinged with a hint of nostalgia for simpler times. “He was quite taken with the idea, and I believe it genuinely opened his eyes to the complexities and joys of human interaction.”"
"Back at the house I was still struggling to think of as “home,” Gore shyly asked me if I would also “come for a drink.” He had done well, at lunch, to hide his deep embarrassment over my payment",of the bill (with a Ministry expense card); he was adjusting with gold-star alacrity in recognizing that it wouldn’t be a reputation-detonating act for a respectable woman to be seen in a public house in the company of bachelors.,78,"of the bill. His cheeks had flushed a deep crimson, and I could tell that he was mortified by the incident. I reassured him that it was no big deal and that I was grateful for his hospitality. He seemed slightly relieved but still visibly uncomfortable. As we sat down in his living room, the atmosphere was a bit tense. Gore opened a bottle of wine, his hands slightly shaking. He poured two glasses, his eyes meeting mine with a mix of anxiety and hope. I could tell he was trying to make up for the earlier incident, wanting to create a more relaxed and friendly environment. We talked about various topics, avoiding the elephant in the room for a while, until Gore finally broke the silence. He apologized for his earlier behavior, expressing his embarrassment and gratitude for my understanding. I accepted his apology, assuring him that I didn't hold any grudge. Our conversation flowed more naturally after that, and we found common ground in our shared interests. As the evening wore on, the initial awkwardness faded away, replaced by a comfortable camaraderie. We laughed, shared stories, and even debated about our favorite books and movies. By the time we finished the bottle of wine, I felt a sense of warmth and acceptance that I hadn't expected. Gore, to my surprise, had managed to turn a potentially awkward situation into a memorable evening. As I prepared to leave, he walked me to the door, a genuine smile on his face. He thanked me again for coming over, and I reciprocated, feeling a newfound appreciation for his company. I left the house with a lighter heart, already looking forward to our next get-together."
"I coughed at my half-pint. Ralph, a snide and etiolated former field agent, was my",least favorite bridge. He had somehow managed to get assigned the only young woman expat.,30,"unwanted companion on this peculiar journey. His pallor was almost otherworldly, contrasting sharply with his once well-tailored suits now stained and frayed from the chaos we'd encountered. His eyes, once sharp and calculating, now darted around with a nervous energy, betraying his usual composed facade. He clutched a tattered briefcase, its contents a mystery, as he mumbled about a mission gone awry, a mission that had led us straight into the heart of danger. Despite his uninviting demeanor, there was a certain charm in his desperation, a magnetism that kept me from dismissing him entirely. As we navigated the dimly lit alleyways, his stories of espionage and narrow escapes from death's grip began to weave a tapestry of intrigue around him, making me question whether he was truly a friend or foe in disguise. His every word seemed to carry the weight of secrets, secrets that could either save us or seal our fate. Yet, in this world where trust was as scarce as daylight in these hours, Ralph was a puzzle I couldn't bring myself to walk away from."
“No. Apparently it was very awkward when Ralph came in here for a lunchtime gallon of merlot and spotted him. He’s part of Defence’s tracking,team. You know they don’t much like the fact that the Ministry is a separate institution. They thought the time-door ought to fall under their remit.”,51,"team, and they've been monitoring the situation closely. It seems Ralph was quite embarrassed, and now everyone in the office is talking about it. The whole incident has created an uncomfortable atmosphere, and people are unsure how to address the elephant in the room. Some suggest ignoring it and hoping it blows over, while others think a team meeting might help clear the air. Meanwhile, the office gossip mill is working overtime, making an already tense situation even more challenging to navigate."
"“He used the word ‘Negro’ until I stopped him, but I don’t think he meant it with","two g’s, if that’s what you’re asking me. How’s your expat managing the news of your miscegenation?”",34,"malice,” I explained to him gently, hoping to educate him on the evolution of racial terminology without causing offense. “It’s important to use terms that are respectful and considerate of people’s feelings,” I continued, striving to foster understanding and promote a more inclusive dialogue. “Today, we prefer terms like ‘African American’ or simply ‘Black,’ depending on the context and the individual’s preference,” I added, aiming to bridge the gap of ignorance with kindness and information. “Language is powerful and can either build bridges or walls,” I concluded, leaving him with a thought to ponder on the impact of our words. "
I choked. “Uh. We don’t use that word anymore. We just say,"‘Black.’ As an adjective. You would say, ‘She is a Black woman.’ ”",25,"politically incorrect.” My friend looked at me, surprised but amused."
"Graham used other words too, not wrong, exactly, but not right, like “your people,” or “your culture.” When I said, in a wincingly tight voice, that we had the same people and culture, he replied, mildly, “But I don’t think that we do.” Then came the image searches about Cambodia, on food and dress","and customs. I had to do those for him, in the early days, because he still didn’t know how, and the English-language internet was not on my side. Exotic, friendly, conservative, resilient. The way he couched his questions, too, was imperfect. I had to correct “ancestor” for “grandparent,” “sacred” for “polite,” “tribal leaders” for “farmers.”",109,
"He smiled, dimples curving. “I think, as we are ‘housemates,’","and also, I hope, friends, that you should call me Graham.”",21,we should share responsibilities and perhaps even some meals together to make our stay more enjoyable and efficient.
"“After you returned home yesterday, the Brigadier came back to see Arthur. They had a conversation","about television, which Arthur seems to think is a wonderful invention. The Brigadier mentioned ‘Auntie’s output.’ ”",33,"that seemed to last for hours, discussing matters of great importance, possibly about the upcoming military maneuvers or the political climate in the region, perhaps even touching upon the rumors of a potential alliance with foreign powers that could shift the balance of power significantly."
"This old wound, formerly healed, he’d received in Australia with Captain Stokes. A gun had exploded in his hands. They were rowing up a river in the captain’s gig, charting its","course. The cockatoos they’d spotted on the opposite bank were so dense as to be cloudlike, billowing from tree to tree. He’d taken up his fowling piece and sighted along the barrel.",63,"uncharted waters. The explosion had torn through the small boat, sending splinters everywhere and leaving him momentarily blinded by the flash and deafened by the roar. Captain Stokes, though equally shocked, managed to keep his wits about him and steered them back to the main ship. The crew, upon seeing the condition of their captain and the new recruit, worked tirelessly to patch up the injuries. The doctor, a stern but fair man, examined him closely, his fingers probing the wound that had reopened from the shock and movement. ""You're lucky, Mr. Carter,"" the doctor remarked, his voice a mix of concern and relief. ""The bullet passed clean through, but we must keep a close watch on it."" Carter nodded, the pain a dull throb beneath his skin, a constant reminder of the narrow escape. As days turned into weeks, the wound healed once more, though the incident left an indelible mark on him, a physical scar and a mental one. He became more cautious, more aware of the fragility of life, and the responsibility that came with it as a member of the crew."
"It’s surprising, then, that I allowed Graham’s drawing of the projection device to enter my files as a joke, like a coin minted 70 BC. I thought it was a form of juvenilia, drawn in","his earliest years as a modern man, something to remind him of on a significant anniversary of his arrival here; and not, as it would turn out to be, a red letter from another era.",70,"an impulsive moment of teenage rebellion against the seriousness of my work. Little did I know that this seemingly trivial piece of paper would become the cornerstone of a revolution in our understanding of ancient civilizations. The device, as Graham had sketched it, bore an uncanny resemblance to a mechanism that could only have been invented centuries later. Its complexity and the level of precision in its design suggested a knowledge base far beyond what was believed to exist at that time. As I delved deeper into the archives, I found references to similar devices in ancient texts, though they were always described in vague and metaphorical terms. The drawing, with its clear and mechanical lines, offered a glimpse into a lost technology, one that could have only been developed with a sophisticated understanding of engineering principles and mathematics. This revelation sent shockwaves through the academic community, challenging long-held beliefs about the capabilities and achievements of ancient civilizations. The device, if it indeed existed, would require a complete reevaluation of historical timelines and cultural exchanges. My initial oversight had led me to a discovery that could redefine our understanding of history, pushing back the timeline of technological advancement by millennia. The implications were staggering, and the responsibility of handling such a find was immense. I knew that the drawing, once dismissed as a joke, was now the key to unlocking a mystery that could change everything we thought we knew about the past."
"By the start of that summer, Graham was practically a native of the era. He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle. Most mornings he rose—hours before me—and",went for a run. He would sometimes wake me up with a juicy smoker’s wheeze on his return to the house. He started giving me custody of his cigarettes and enforced a predinner smoking ban.,70,"spent time on his modest front porch, sipping coffee and watching the sun rise over the sleepy town. His neighbors greeted him with nods and smiles, recognizing the man who had become an integral part of their community. He often volunteered at the local library, helping to organize books and assisting elderly patrons with their research. His days were filled with a comforting routine, one that he had come to cherish. Occasionally, he would take long walks through the nearby park, where he'd reflect on the changes he'd seen in the world and the small, yet significant, role he played in it. His evenings were reserved for reading, a passion that had deepened over the years, allowing him to escape into different worlds and times. Despite his love for the present, Graham held onto memories of the past, finding solace in the stories of those who had come before him. His life, though simple, was rich with meaning and connection, a testament to the power of adaptation and community. As the seasons changed, Graham remained a steadfast presence, a living bridge between eras, embodying the spirit of resilience and continuity."
"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past. I was prickly and defensive about","this; I could not look at why directly. I heard the way I spoke to him about it: adjustment, reasonable, citizen, responsibility, values. He blew a lot of pensive cigarette smoke at me.",65,"our shared history, clinging to the old ways as a lifeline to a time that seemed less complicated and more authentic. I would argue with him, trying to convince him that change wasn't necessarily bad, that progress could preserve the essence of what we held dear. Yet, his eyes would glaze over when the topic arose, and I could sense the weight of his nostalgia, a longing for a world that no longer existed. Despite my efforts, I couldn't shake the feeling that Graham saw me as someone who was abandoning the traditions that defined us, someone who was willing to let go of the past for the sake of fitting in. This tension between our perspectives created a rift that grew wider with each passing day, leaving us both adrift in a sea of modernity that neither of us could fully embrace."
"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them. Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled","to focus on the tests—eyes moving rapidly. I once found him the sole occupant of the fifth-floor smoking area (a pigeon-shit-encrusted balcony), methodically shredding a filter of a finished cigarette. I watched him for a while, interested in the way that only his fingers moved. Most people ripple with surplus motion unless they are concentrating, but Graham only ever moved the parts of him that he wanted to move.",137,completion
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too. Even Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had","fought in large-scale battles, were laid out by the ultramodern scope of the harm. They began to resist the exams psychologically, spoiling our hard-won data. It was agreed that we’d delay introducing them to Hiroshima, Auschwitz, and the Twin Towers. Control promised to provide a timeline for the revelations, but it hadn’t materialized.",105,
"Adela was always present at the honesty exams, often intervening in them. I got the impression that she was listening to offstage prompts that only she could","hear, being the only one among us who was aware she was on a stage, and was trying to chivvy us along the right course of action.",54,"understand. Her actions seemed rehearsed, as if she were reading from a script that only she possessed. This behavior puzzled me, making me question her motives and the integrity of the exams themselves. Was she genuinely helping those who struggled, or was there a deeper, perhaps more manipulative reason behind her interventions? The more I observed, the more I felt there was a story untold, one that involved Adela and perhaps others who were not immediately visible. Her presence became a mystery, one that I was determined to unravel, not just for my own understanding but to ensure the fairness and trustworthiness of the exams."
"Adela smiled with about a third of her mouth. Her face had changed again. She looked pinched and hungry,",and hauntingly as if her skin was held in place by a bulldog clip at the back of her skull.,39,"her eyes sunken and dark circles under them, a clear sign of the malnutrition she had been battling for weeks. Despite the grim transformation, Adela's spirit remained unbroken, her determination to overcome her circumstances unwavering. She knew she had to find a way to get more food, not just for herself but for her family who relied on her. The thought of their empty bellies and the desperation in their eyes fueled her resolve. She decided to take the risk of venturing into the nearby town, a place she had avoided due to the dangers it posed, especially for someone like her, who was now visibly weakened and vulnerable. Adela prepared what little she had, a meager bundle of possessions and the scant food she managed to save. With each step towards the town, her heart pounded with a mix of fear and hope. She hoped to find work, anything that could bring in some money, or perhaps a charity that might help. The journey was long and arduous, but Adela's determination kept her moving forward, her mind focused on the future she envisioned for herself and her family. As she entered the town, the bustling streets and the sight of well-fed people only served to highlight her own dire situation, but it also ignited a spark of hope. She knew she had to be brave, to speak up, to ask for help, and to fight for her family's survival."
"I went along to one of the earliest dinners, chicken bag slung over my shoulder. Bridges tended not to eat at the Ministry canteen with administrative staff and the operators on the Wellness team—the office-based employees—and the decorous hostility with which the paper pushers met me was adorable. When I got to the","kitchen itself, the first thing I saw was Graham leaning down to light a cigarette on the gas ring, his curls dangerously close to the hob. We’d had to disable smoke detectors in every Ministry room that Graham used. If he couldn’t have a cigarette, he’d throw whatever experiment he was strapped into.",106,
"She put a glass down in front of me—ice, water, an oily suggestion of cordial, and,","sure enough, some fussy edible garnishes. I blinked at it and then at Margaret, who smiled.",32,"she leaned back, her eyes never leaving mine, as if expecting me to say something profound or revealing."
"Graham said, “Hm!” and pulled hard on his cigarette. He wandered off with the expansive air of a man who might pick up some parsley, not because",he has been told to but because that might be a jolly thing to do en route to his next footloose and fancy-free destination. I watched him go.,55,"he particularly needed it, but because it was there and he felt a vague sense of accomplishment from the act of acquisition. His mind, usually a whirlwind of thoughts, was momentarily at ease, allowing him to appreciate the simplicity of the moment. The crisp air nipped at his cheeks as he walked, a reminder of the brisk morning that had just begun. He contemplated the day ahead, wondering what trivial tasks he might encounter and how he would approach them. Would he continue his morning with another aimless stroll, or perhaps he'd return to his work, his cigarette now a forgotten anchor to a moment of contemplation?"
"“No,” said Margaret. She shrugged at my expression. “An’ I forsake this duty,” she said, “we’ll sicken. Forty-seven",thinks tobacco is an herb. But womenfolk were cordoned at the stove for centuries. The men mun take lessons.”,37,"years of neglect will take their toll on our health, and we'll regret not having upheld our responsibilities when we could have. It's better to face the challenge now than to suffer the consequences later, when it might be too late to make amends."
The Brigadier drifted closer. He did look hungry. He looked like I did as a student when I ate nothing but buttered,toast and apples. He turned the white of used candlewax when Margaret opened the oven to better squint at her roast potatoes.,44,"toast for three weeks straight, except the toast was now a full-grown man with a stern expression and a military uniform, and I was a woman who commanded a battalion, not a college dorm's makeshift kitchen."
"“ ’Tis all the same to me, sir,” said Margaret, “though I fear",this cod will grow legs and walk afore my ‘colleague’ returns with my parsley.”,27,my duty to my master should be neglected.” She spoke with a firmness
"Because we lived in a government-owned residence, there were also restrictions on how","long we could have the air-conditioning on. Graham picked at this, irritating and irritated.",27,"we could decorate our home. We were allowed to paint only certain colors, and the furniture had to be approved by the authorities. This meant that our home always looked very uniform and lacked personal touches. Additionally, we were not allowed to have guests over without prior permission, which made socializing with friends and family quite challenging. We had to inform the authorities about any visitors, and they would often come unannounced to check on us. This constant surveillance made us feel like we were living under strict surveillance, which was quite stifling. Despite these restrictions, we tried to make the best of our situation by forming close-knit communities within our neighborhood, where we would share small joys and support each other through the difficulties. This sense of camaraderie helped us cope with the limitations imposed on our lives."
"Movement was anathema. I slept, mostly, naked and poaching in my sweat. The water ration forced Graham to switch finally to thirty-second showers. I didn’t see him for the whole of the heat wave.",We left our bedroom doors open with the intention of letting the air circulate—though the air hung like an executed corpse—and said lackluster things about making a salad to each other from our separate cells.,69,"My days were a blur of lethargy and the relentless buzz of flies. The power supply was erratic, and when it did come on, it was for such short bursts that it was more of an annoyance than a relief. I tried to read, but the pages stuck together, and my concentration span was as short as the electricity. Graham's absence was a void, his usual morning knock on the door a phantom that jolted me awake with false hope. I imagined him, perhaps collapsed from dehydration, lying somewhere out of sight, his body a silent testament to the severity of the situation. I rationed my thoughts, conserving energy for the inevitable moment when he would return, or when I would have to venture out into the unforgiving sun to search for him. The days bled into each other, marked only by the changing shadows cast by the sun that dared to peek through the cracks in the walls. I began to dream of water, vast oceans that enveloped me, cool and endless. In my dreams, I swam with schools of fish, their scales shimmering like tiny mirrors reflecting the blue expanse above. When I awoke, the reality was a harsh contrast to the tranquility of my slumber. The heat pressed down, unyielding, and the thought of water became an obsession. I devised plans to collect rainwater, to dig a well, to fashion some sort of contraption to extract moisture from the air. Each idea was as futile as the last, but the desperation to survive fueled my imagination. I began to talk to Graham, out loud, as if his presence could somehow bridge the chasm of his absence. I recounted our plans, our dreams, the simple joys of life that seemed so distant now. My voice, hoarse from dehydration and disuse, echoed off the walls, a ghostly whisper in the silent house. The nights were the worst, the darkness a tangible entity that pressed in from all sides, suffocating. I tried to sleep, to escape the reality of my situation, but my mind was a whirlwind of thoughts and fears. Each time I closed my eyes, I saw his face, gaunt and pale, a reflection of my own. I knew that when the sun finally set on this ordeal, it would leave a mark on us both, a scar that would never fully heal. But until then, I clung to the hope that Graham would return, that the rains would come, that life would find a way to persevere through the relentless heat."
"Adela took bridge meetings in a soundproof room deep in the Ministry’s chest. She always arrived first, and we’d find her sitting at the top of",a long table like a mannequin awaiting the gift of demonic possession. But this time I arrived a quarter of an hour early and she wasn’t there.,53,"the bridge, cards spread out before her, her expression one of intense concentration. Her sessions were always private, with no one allowed to enter until she had finished her game. Rumors swirled about the nature of her work, but Adela remained tight-lipped, her dedication to her task never wavering. Her role within the Ministry was shrouded in mystery, and her contributions to the war effort were known only to a select few. Her ability to maintain focus and composure under pressure was legendary, and her success rate was unmatched. Her sessions were a crucial part of the strategy meetings, providing insights that were invaluable to the war planners. Despite the secrecy, there was a sense of respect among her colleagues for her dedication and skill. Her work was essential, and her contributions were a key factor in the Ministry's strategic advantage."
Adela was standing at the sink and anarchically disobeying the water ration by running her wrists under cold,"water. She looked unwell, but God alone knows how her plastic surgeon thought she was supposed to look.",36,"water, her eyes closed, savoring the forbidden luxury. The tap dripped steadily, a small rebellion against the austere measures imposed by the government. She imagined the water as a symbol of freedom, a liquid that could wash away the constraints of her daily life. Her mind wandered to the days before the drought, when water flowed freely and abundantly, and she could take long showers without a care in the world. Now, every drop felt precious, and she held onto the belief that this small act of defiance was a way to reclaim some of that lost abundance. She didn't know how long she could continue this secret indulgence, but for now, it was her small act of rebellion against the harsh reality of scarcity."
"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it,","was a mystery. She didn’t enjoy the prestige, as the Secretary did, and she seemed bizarrely overworked for the proxy boss of a project in its pilot stage.",56,"we could only speculate. Perhaps it was due to her impressive academic background or maybe she had connections within the organization. Regardless, her attitude towards us was condescending and made our work environment toxic. We tried to address the issue with our supervisor, hoping for some intervention, but it seemed like our concerns fell on deaf ears. Adela's behavior continued to undermine team morale, and productivity suffered as a result. Meetings became battlegrounds of passive-aggressive comments and thinly veiled insults. It was clear that Adela's presence was a divisive force, and many of us began to question the decision-making process that had led to her appointment. Despite our best efforts to integrate her into the team and provide constructive feedback, Adela remained unyielding in her approach, seemingly oblivious to the discord she was causing. As weeks turned into months, the tension only escalated, leaving us all wondering when, or if, the situation would ever improve."
"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had","just discovered that a woman with whom he was spending a lot of time would never be interested in him. I frowned, and he frowned, and we were frowning into our tea.",64,"realized he was staring back at me, his eyes wide with a mix of surprise and something that might have been curiosity. I smiled, feeling a warmth spread through me, and decided to break the awkward silence. ""You look like you're lost in thought,"" I said, trying to sound casual. ""Or maybe you're just enjoying your coffee?"" I gestured towards his mug, which was still steaming slightly, hoping to ease the tension. He blinked, as if my words had snapped him out of a daydream, and then he chuckled, a low, pleasant sound that made my heart skip a beat. ""Actually,"" he began, his voice gaining confidence, ""I was just thinking about how strange it is to find someone who not only notices but also seems to appreciate the little things, like the way the morning light plays on a mug."" His words were sincere, and I felt a connection forming, a spark of something more. ""Well,"" I replied, trying to keep my voice steady, ""I believe in paying attention to the details. They often tell a story we might miss otherwise."" I offered him a genuine smile, hoping it conveyed my interest and openness to whatever conversation might follow. He returned the smile, and there was a moment of silence as we both considered the next step in our interaction, a silent agreement to explore this unexpected connection further."
"Graham blew smoke out through his nose reflectively. “I see,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s fair to call him ‘grim,’ though you wouldn’t be the","first to say it. He was a severe disciplinarian, it’s true. Held grudges. But he was a very lonely person. Romantic, too, which made his loneliness worse.”",53,"first to do so.” He paused, considering his next words carefully. “He’s been through a lot, more than most people could handle. Maybe we should try to understand him before we judge.”"
"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders. The bridges kept turning in their core reports, and the experiments kept running. Given how much of our working day the data collection took, we all assumed that the time-travel project was running to the stated purpose. Every day I had to record his heart rate, his blood pressure, his temperature; every day a written record of what he wore, what he ate, how much","exercise he took; every week checking progress against the imaginary benchmarks set by Control, use of phone, use of transport, use of media and the assessment of how harmful or useful each medium was; all the time the corrective tests for vocabulary and habit; novelistic observations on his character and temperament. It seemed that the job continued. I suppose if you switch on your lights and boil your kettle with energy provided by a nuclear power station, you don’t spend much time reflecting on the fact that the atom had originally been split to kill cities.",192,
"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events. He’d lain motionless in the garden for two hours, on","a wet and putrid night, to shoot a fox, and pulled out one of his own rotting teeth (he showed it to me afterward; it was the color of a tombstone, caped with gelatinous red)—was this Victorian, or was this “irregularities”?",81,"his usual blanket, a patchwork quilt that seemed to absorb the sun's rays like a solar panel. His eyes were closed, and his breathing was slow and even, almost imperceptible. A gentle breeze played with the few strands of his silver hair, lifting them momentarily before letting them settle back against his forehead. Birds chirped in the distance, their songs a soft melody against the backdrop of the quiet afternoon. I approached cautiously, unsure of how to react to this unexpected stillness from someone who was always in motion, always talking, always planning his next grand scheme. His skin, usually flushed with the vigor of his ideas, was now pale, almost translucent under the sun's fading light. I reached out a hand, hesitating for a moment before I let my fingers brush against his wrist, checking for a pulse. It was there, steady and strong, a reassuring beat beneath the surface of his skin. I sat down beside him, crossing my legs Indian-style, mirroring his position. I watched him, trying to decipher the enigma that was Graham. Was he meditating, lost in some profound thought, or was there something more serious at play? I considered calling for help, but something held me back. Perhaps it was respect for his privacy or the fear of disrupting whatever tranquility he had found. Instead, I remained seated, a silent guardian in the garden, waiting for Graham to emerge from his stillness and return to the world of the living."
"So I was anxious about Graham’s disdain for the twenty-first century, because never mind that I felt rejected by it, I was worried that the universe would feel the atemporal sting of his contempt and take","him away. My England wasn’t like this, he’d told me—but this was the natural evolution of his England. I was the natural evolution. I was his lens if he would only raise me and look with me.",73,"its revenge on us all. I imagined time itself slowing down, clocks ticking backward, and history books being rewritten to erase the era he despised. I tried to convince him that every century had its merits, from the technological marvels to the cultural shifts, but he dismissed my arguments with a wave of his hand, his eyes glazed over with a mix of nostalgia and disdain. I feared that his bitterness might somehow seep into the fabric of time, staining it with a permanent mark of his disapproval, and that the future would forever remember the man who hated an entire era for its lack of elegance and simplicity. I wondered if there was anything I could do to bridge the gap between him and the modern world, to show him that progress wasn't just about faster cars and louder music, but about the freedom to explore, to question, and to imagine a better tomorrow."
"I persuaded Graham to use the tiny office, in which I ordinarily worked, to cram for the test. The Ministry gave no indication of what format","the test would take, or what manner of questions would be asked, or tasks set. I thought this was unfair, and suggested as much to him.",52,"of the examination would be, so it was best to be prepared for anything. I cleared the desk, moved the filing cabinet against the door for privacy, and laid out all of Graham's notes and textbooks. I even brewed a pot of coffee to keep us awake through the night. As we sat there, surrounded by the scent of coffee and the hum of the city outside, I couldn't help but feel a sense of camaraderie. Graham, usually so reserved, seemed to appreciate the effort. We worked tirelessly, going over notes, discussing theories, and occasionally taking short breaks to stretch our legs. The hours passed quickly, and just as dawn was painting the sky with hues of pink and orange, we decided to take a final look over everything. Exhausted but satisfied, we knew we had done everything we could. Graham thanked me profusely, his usual calm demeanor replaced with genuine gratitude. As he left the office, I couldn't help but smile, feeling a strange sense of accomplishment despite the lack of sleep. The morning light streamed through the window, casting a warm glow over the empty desk, and I knew that whatever the test held, Graham was ready."
"There was an embarrassed silence, then: “Shame!” yelled Margaret","from the audience. “Fie! Rhubarb, rhubarb! And diverse other curses!”",19,"as everyone turned to look at the blushing culprit who had dropped her tray in the cafeteria, causing the commotion."
"The person I was referring to was lurking at the far edge of the auditorium, with hair the color of wet earth under moonlight and a pinched, unhappy expression. I don’t think Salese could have looked more disapproving if we’d all started","sucking at one another’s fleshly parts and chanting “Hail, Satan!” The Brigadier was standing beside Salese. They were speaking, heads close together. They looked as if they were in an invisible bell jar of gloom which blocked out the room’s miniature festivities.",84,"jumping naked on a table, shouting expletives about the speaker's mother. Her arms were folded so tightly across her chest that I wondered if she was trying to squeeze the judgment out of herself along with the displeasure. The rest of the crowd seemed oblivious to her discontent, absorbed in the speaker's words or perhaps in the spectacle of the evening itself. The event was a fundraiser for the local library, and the room buzzed with the low hum of conversation and the occasional clink of glasses. Salese's disapproval was a stark contrast to the generally convivial atmosphere, a lone island of discontent in a sea of social engagement. I couldn't help but wonder what had led her to such a state of unhappiness, what personal grievance or philosophical objection could make her so visibly uncomfortable in the midst of such a benign gathering. Perhaps she was a staunch advocate for literacy and felt the event's casual nature was a mockery of the cause. Or maybe she had a personal stake in the library, having relied on its resources in the past, and the sight of it being used as a backdrop for a social event was too much to bear. Whatever the reason, her presence was a poignant reminder that not everyone finds joy in communal celebrations, and that beneath the surface of any gathering, there are stories untold and perspectives unshared."
"“I’m afraid I’ve only ever met the Secretary,” said the Brigadier.",“But I would very much like to meet Vice Secretary Adela.”,22,"He added, with a hint of regret in his voice, ""I've never had the pleasure of meeting the General in person."""
"I went home and, on arrival, checked my emails. As with a driving",test—or the lieutenants’ exam—the acclimatization exam results were delivered immediately. Graham had passed.,26,"car trip, I noticed several important messages that required immediate attention, prompting me to respond promptly to avoid any potential issues that could have arisen from delayed communication."
"I cycled up to the nice grocery store to buy a bottle of champagne, pausing on the way home for a soft-serve ice cream. I sat on the bench to lick the ripple into a mound and think about the","Brigadier. A man of bivouac experience, I felt; there was something disturbingly makeshift about both him and Salese, as if they’d been dropped behind enemy lines and were mimicking familiarity while waiting for the right moment to cut a throat.",80,"celebration ahead. The sun was setting, casting a warm glow over the park, and I felt a sense of contentment. As I savored the last bite of my ice cream, I thought about how simple pleasures like these could bring joy into my life. The anticipation of popping the cork on the champagne, marking a special occasion, made the mundane trip to the store worthwhile. I mounted my bike, the soft-serve cone now just a memory, and pedaled home, eager to share the day's small victories with those I cared about."
"“Apparently I can pass as an eccentric. I suggested that somewhere like Scotland, Arthur and I might","simply pass as Englishmen. One of the panel was a Scotsman, and I think he liked that.”",34,"find a secluded spot to live out our days in peace, away from the prying eyes of society. He agreed, envisioning a life where we could be ourselves without judgment or the need to conform to expectations. We talked about the rugged beauty of the Scottish Highlands, the tranquility of the lochs, and the comfort of the misty moors. It was a dream that seemed possible, a chance to start anew and build a life based on our own terms, far from the pressures and pretenses of the city."
"When I brought the glass up—stoppering the rest of the bottle for dinner—I could hear Graham singing “I love to steal awhile away,” occasionally muffled by his drags on a cigarette. Water plashed against the tub.","He dropped to humming and presumably soaping. I slid quietly to the floor and leaned my head against the wall. I wasn’t going to see a Ministry therapist. I knew I should, and I knew I wouldn’t.",73,"His voice was a low, gravelly hum, the kind that spoke of long nights and even longer stories. The bathroom was steamy, the air thick with the scent of soap and tobacco. Graham seemed lost in his own world, the kind that only those who've found solace in solitude understand. I watched him for a moment, the way the dim light played across his features, casting shadows that danced with his every breath. It was a rare, unguarded moment, one that I knew wouldn't last. The water continued to cascade, a steady rhythm that matched the beat of his song. I wondered what stories those notes held, what memories they stirred within him. Perhaps they were of happier times, of days when the world seemed less complicated, less harsh. Or maybe they were a form of escape, a way to push back against the weight of his current reality. Either way, it was clear that music was his refuge, a sanctuary where he could be himself, unburdened by the expectations of others. As I left the room, I carried with me the melody of his song, a reminder of the complexity of human emotions and the power of music to touch the soul."
"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century. On ships there were cooks and officers’ stewards; at home, on the few occasions he was at home, there were women. Nevertheless, he had taken to cooking in a way he had failed to take to","television or texting or the use of deodorants (“I bathe every day,” he’d said to me with hurt dignity). Tonight, he hummed with a busyness that hardly shielded nervousness. He burned the onions and automatically reached for his cigarettes. I took them away—I didn’t want ashy Bolognese—and he accused me of “nanny-stating” him, a turn of phrase I found very alarming because I certainly hadn’t taught it to him. Where was he picking this stuff up?",152," cooking in the past. He found it oddly therapeutic, the precise measurements and the ritualistic chopping of vegetables. The first time he attempted scrambled eggs, he was aghast at the simplicity yet the potential for disaster if one moment was lost or overlooked. He had to remind himself that in this new era, precision was key, and the margin for error was slim. The first time he made toast, he burned it, but he saw it as a challenge rather than a failure. Each mistake was a lesson, and each successful dish was a small victory. He learned to appreciate the subtle flavors of herbs and spices, which he had previously ignored. Cooking became a way for him to connect with the world around him, to understand the culture of this time through the food. He started experimenting with recipes from cookbooks, some of which seemed overly complicated with their myriad of ingredients and steps. Yet, he persevered, driven by a desire to master this new skill. He even began to host small dinner parties, his guests unaware of his initial ineptitude. They marveled at his dishes, none the wiser to the fact that he had once found boiling water a complex task. Cooking had transformed from a necessary chore to a cherished hobby, a testament to his adaptability and his ability to embrace change."
Margaret was wearing high-waisted cerulean bell-bottoms and a white blouse clocked with lace. She looked like a disco,"goddess, an astonishing concoction given that she was only barely older than the piano, never mind the synth.",36,"queen, her hair styled in voluminous curls framing her face, and her platform sandals clicking on the polished floor as she made her grand entrance into the party, drawing everyone's attention with her vibrant energy and retro chic style."
"Arthur was happy and flushed. He was one of those unusual extroverts who have all the attributes of an introvert, save that they like being around other people. He had a gift for gentleness too, one of the rarest virtues in","any gender and especially in the kind of man Arthur was supposed to be. I eased some biography out of him: half-decent public school; classics at Oxford, where he’d had a lot of fun and failed his exams; retraining as a doctor.",83,"human society. His friends often remarked that he could make anyone feel at ease, as if they were the only person in the room. This talent made him a beloved confidant and a pillar of support for those who felt overwhelmed by the noise and chaos of life. He had a knack for listening, truly listening, which was more than most could say. His empathy was so profound that he could often predict the unspoken thoughts and feelings of others, bridging gaps of understanding with ease. This ability, coupled with his innate kindness, allowed him to navigate social situations with grace and poise, leaving a trail of positively transformed interactions in his wake. Despite his outward sociability, Arthur cherished his alone time, using it to recharge and reflect, ensuring that his interactions with others were always genuine and meaningful. His friends admired him not just for his sociability, but for his authenticity and the way he could bring out the best in people, making the world a little brighter for those fortunate enough to cross his path."
I saw Graham’s eyebrow quirk in a rascally way as he did,"the math. “You became a captain extremely quickly, Sixteen. Found your forte?”",24,"he reached into his pocket, pulling out a crumpled piece of paper that seemed to hold the key to our next adventure."
"Arthur grimaced. I saw his hand shiver momentarily on his glass, and then he","swallowed everything in it with a wet click. “Promotion was—fast—in the war,” he said shortly.",29,"regained his composure, his eyes narrowing as he continued our conversation, seemingly unaffected by the earlier tremor."
"Margaret, incidentally, listened to the men talk about their careers with a suffused urgency that only I noticed. In her own era, she’d slept in the room next to the one where she had been born.","She thought Scotland was far-flung and semi-barbaric. When we came round to talking about my time working as a translator in Cambodia, I felt her attention all over me. I may have talked slightly too much.",72,"She often thought about the walls that had witnessed her infancy, now silent and unchanging, as she lay in her bed at night. The conversations of the men, filled with ambition and the drive to achieve, seemed to echo the fervor of her own past life. Margaret, though retired and living in a different time, carried the spirit of her youth within her. Her mind was a treasure trove of memories from a time when she, too, was navigating the complexities of career and personal life. She remembered the late-night discussions with her colleagues, the challenges they faced, and the triumphs they celebrated. Their stories resonated with her, reminding her of the days when she, too, was at the peak of her professional endeavors. She felt a kinship with these men, understanding the passion that fueled their words. In her heart, she knew that despite the passage of time and the changes in society, the fundamental human drive to succeed and leave a mark remained constant. Margaret's presence in the room, listening intently, was a testament to her enduring curiosity and the unquenchable thirst for knowledge that had always been a part of her. Her life, though quieter now, was rich with the stories of others, and she found a new sense of purpose in understanding and connecting with the lives of those around her."
"How the topic of weed came up I couldn’t remember—probably during one of the vigorous debates about what the twenty-first century had genuinely improved, which in",the opinion of the expats was a mixed bag. I was shortly handing my grinder and papers to Graham (who was far more adept at rolling).,52,"our discussion seemed to be more about nostalgia than progress. We were a group of friends who met regularly, each carrying our own set of memories and opinions. As the debate heated up, with points flying back and forth, the conversation naturally meandered through various subjects, touching on societal changes, technological advancements, and personal experiences. Somehow, the conversation pivoted towards the legalization of cannabis, a topic that had been gaining traction in the news and among our peer groups. One friend, who had recently visited a state where weed was legal for recreational use, recounted his experiences with a mix of excitement and disbelief. He spoke about the ease of access, the variety of strains, and the surprisingly normal atmosphere of the dispensaries. This sparked a lively debate among us, with some expressing cautious optimism about the potential benefits of regulated weed, while others raised concerns about its societal impacts. The discussion ranged from its potential as a source of tax revenue to its implications on public health and safety. We debated the differences between decriminalization and legalization, the role of government regulation, and the evolving attitudes towards drug use in society. As the evening wore on, we found ourselves not only arguing but also sharing personal anecdotes and listening to each other's perspectives with an open mind. The conversation, though heated at times, brought us closer as friends, reinforcing our bond through shared experiences and mutual respect for differing viewpoints. In the end, we didn't reach a definitive conclusion, but we agreed to stay informed and revisit the topic as new developments unfolded. The debate about weed had become a microcosm of the broader societal conversations we were all engaged in, reflecting the complexities and nuances of living in the twenty-first century."
"Meeting Margaret made me vivid and receptive. Sentences weighed more. I kept a half-conscious catalog of where the men were looking. I’ve seen people deal with this in different ways. By “this,” I mean power. I mean magnetism. I try to absorb it. Within twenty minutes Margaret","and I were planning a girls-take-Soho night out, which necessitated me explaining the history of Soho, the concept of clubbing, the genre of R & B, the club night R & She, and dancing. I hadn’t been clubbing since I was an assistant in Languages. No matter.",94,"of our conversation, I felt a subtle shift in my demeanor. Her presence seemed to infuse me with a quiet confidence, making my words carry a weight they hadn't before. She spoke of her experiences, each story a thread in the tapestry of her life, woven with resilience and insight. I listened intently, realizing that her ability to command attention wasn't just about her words, but the way she carried herself, the unspoken language of her body and eyes. She taught me that true power isn't about dominating others, but about inspiring them, about being so authentic and self-assured that you naturally draw others towards you. As we parted ways, I felt a newfound clarity about my own potential, a sense that I too could harness this invisible force, not to manipulate, but to connect and understand. Margaret had unwittingly become my mentor, her magnetism a beacon guiding me towards a deeper understanding of human connection and influence."
"“Such matters are between myself and God,” he said gravely. “Oh, stop frowning, Sixty-five.","Arthur, will you please lead her in a polka, if you can still stand.”",28,"He tried to smile, but his face remained stern. ""I appreciate your concern, but this is something I must handle alone,"" he added, his voice firm yet tinged with an underlying sadness that seemed to weigh heavily on his words."
"“In this age, musicians are imprinted inside music boxes, and there is no need for the band to","keep time,” said Margaret. “You will instruct me in the polka, or I will step on your toes.”",36,"perform live; their voices and instruments are captured digitally and played back indefinitely, creating a timeless performance that never ages or forgets a note."
"Arthur, by contrast, danced beautifully. He dipped me, and I bent like","a reed. He spun me, and I was, with such satisfaction, spun.",24,"an elegant swan, causing gasps from the onlookers, their eyes wide with surprise and admiration."
"As soon as she stepped in, I started making a tally of the evidence of unbeauty. There was a chair whose seat was filled with clothes too dirty for the wardrobe but too clean for the washing basket. My bedside table sprouted two water glasses and a mug. Dust crouched on the skirting boards and in the seams of","my chest of drawers. When a woman is as impossibly attractive as Margaret, the mediocrity shed by a woman like me bustles around her like a horde of pigeons. Or so I thought, at that time. Truthfully, I’d been foxed by how beautiful she was. I felt a complicated anguish when I saw her little besocked toes treadling the carpet.",119,"the carpet, creating a subtle, yet unmistakable layer of grime. The walls, though recently painted, bore the scars of past arguments, with a few dents and a small, unexplained scratch near the light switch. The air was thick with the scent of old books and a hint of something sour, possibly left-out fruit or an unemptied trash bin. A stack of magazines lay abandoned on the coffee table, their pages fluttering slightly in the draft from an open window, suggesting a half-finished task or perhaps a lack of interest in the articles within. The television was on, but the sound was muted, with closed captions scrolling silently, indicating that someone had been watching but perhaps not fully engaged with the content. The overall impression was one of neglect, a space where care had been given at some point but had since lapsed into a state of comfortable disarray."
Margaret appeared unaware of any of these concerns. She didn’t even glance at herself,in the mirror. She gave me an interested grin as I pulled out my lipsticks.,29,"in the mirror when she entered the restroom. Her mind was preoccupied with the upcoming job interview, her hands nervously fidgeting with the hem of her blouse as she washed them, trying to calm her racing thoughts. She needed this job, not just for the money, but for the sense of accomplishment and validation it would bring. Her reflection showed a determined woman, albeit one with a slight tremor in her hands, a testament to the anxiety bubbling inside her. She took a deep breath, drying her hands, and stepped out, ready to face whatever questions they might throw her way."
"I’d stopped wearing it—I was, at the time, thinking of the way my face might be received by a Victorian who didn’t approve of cosmetics—but I demonstrated the coverage of my sole foundation. Margaret","was amazed by the smoothness of its application and the faithfulness of its shade. She drew an arrow with it on her cheek. On her fair skin, it looked like clay. We started giggling.",68,"had watched, her eyes wide with a mixture of astonishment and curiosity. She reached out a hand, hesitantly at first, then more confidently, to touch the smooth, flawless surface of my skin where it met the edge of my foundation. ""It's like magic,"" she murmured, her voice filled with wonder. ""You look as though you've been kissed by the angels themselves."" Her words, though meant as a compliment, made me acutely aware of the deception involved. I smiled, a little uncomfortably, knowing that the illusion I presented was far from the truth. The foundation, a marvel of modern science, hid the imperfections and blemishes that were a part of my everyday life. It was a barrier between me and the world, a silent promise of perfection that I could never truly deliver. Yet, in that moment, under Margaret's approving gaze, I felt a strange sense of liberation. The heavy weight of societal expectations seemed to lift, if only for a brief moment. I realized that perhaps the true magic wasn't in the flawless appearance the foundation provided, but in the confidence it gave me to face the world, blemishes and all. Margaret's reaction, her genuine surprise and delight, reminded me that beauty was not just about physical appearance but also about the light in one's eyes and the kindness in their smile. As we continued our conversation, I felt a newfound resolve. I would wear my foundation not out of a need to conform to an idealized standard of beauty, but as a symbol of self-acceptance and the courage to be authentically me, flaws and all."
"The door grumbled shut and I fell back into a doze. Margaret was snoring lightly, like a puppy being squeezed. The door reopened, and I","surfaced to vague consciousness. I felt a wave of cool air, and then a gentle warmth. He had spread a blanket over the pair of us.",51,"sat up abruptly, startled by the sudden intrusion. A shaft of moonlight cut through the darkness, illuminating a figure standing in the doorway. It was Margaret, her expression a mix of concern and urgency. ""There's trouble,"" she whispered, her voice barely above a breath, ""someone's coming."" Her eyes darted around the room, ensuring we were hidden. We needed to move, and fast. The clock on the wall ticked ominously, each second echoing the increasing danger outside our door. I nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation. We quickly gathered our things, moving silently to avoid detection. Margaret led the way, her movements precise and calculated. As we made our way through the dark corridors, the only sound was our hushed footsteps and the distant, muffled noise of an approaching threat. We had to find an escape route, a place to hide until the danger passed. Margaret's knowledge of the house's layout proved invaluable as we navigated the shadows, avoiding the light that occasionally pierced the darkness. Her determination was inspiring, a beacon in the uncertainty. We moved with a purpose, driven by the need to survive and the trust that we could rely on each other. The house seemed to come alive with every creak and whisper, amplifying the tension. Our hearts raced, but we pressed on, fueled by the hope that we could outmaneuver our pursuers. The path ahead was fraught with danger, but Margaret's leadership and my resolve kept us moving forward, inching closer to safety with each step."
"All the expats had phones, paid for (and tapped) by the Ministry. Graham had switched his own phone on a total of three times in the seven","months he had been in the twenty-first century. I was therefore unsurprised when, about half an hour after their plane landed, I got a call from Arthur’s phone.",55,"months he'd been in the country. Each time, he'd felt a shiver of paranoia, imagining the Ministry's agents listening in on his conversations. He preferred to communicate in person, or through encrypted messages on his laptop, which he kept hidden under a false bottom in his desk. Graham was aware that his cautious behavior made him an anomaly among the expats, who often joked about the 'taps' as if they were badges of honor, proof of their importance. Yet, Graham knew better; he understood that the Ministry's reach was long, and the less they knew about him, the safer he would be."
"Arthur was striding up the street, bent slightly against a wind which didn’t exist. He was wearing a tweed jacket and looked like a period piece,","but then again, so did Pimlico. I hadn’t seen him since the men had got back from Scotland and I asked him whether he enjoyed his trip.",53,"his fedora perched at a jaunty angle, and his umbrella, though not opened, was held firmly in his other hand. People turned to look at him, some with curiosity, others with confusion, as if he had stepped out of a storybook, a character from a bygone era. The city around him was modern and bustling, yet here he was, an anachronism in a sea of contemporary life. He passed a café where patrons were sipping lattes, their eyes briefly meeting his before returning to their screens and conversations. Arthur's expression remained impassive, his eyes scanning the crowd, searching for something—or someone. His steps were measured, deliberate, as if he knew exactly where he was going, despite the apparent aimlessness of his journey. The wind, or the lack thereof, seemed to have no effect on him, as if he were shielded by an invisible force, or perhaps by his own determination. The city's sounds—honking cars, chatter, the distant hum of the subway—melded into a backdrop, barely registering in his focused mind. He was a man out of time, a ghost wandering through the present, his purpose unknown to those around him."
"It paid off in the early autumn. When I came down for breakfast one morning, I found","Graham at the counter with a dictionary and a tin of protein powder, performing exegesis on the label.",35,"the table set with my favorite meal: freshly baked sourdough toast with butter and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. My mother's smile was the best part of the morning, a testament to her love and the hard work she put into making every day feel special. It was moments like these that reminded me of the warmth and comfort of home, a place where every meal was an act of love and every morning was a new beginning."
"Adela was of the “never been to the GP in my life because I’m not a pussy” school of care, and nothing changed. If the expats were","dangerously ill, they’d be removed to the wards and never mind the trigger; if they could get a grip and deal with it at home, they should.",54,"continuing her tradition, she ignored the growing pain in her abdomen, convinced it was just another bout of indigestion. Her stubbornness was a point of pride, a badge of her independence from the local healthcare system she viewed with disdain. It wasn't until the pain became unbearable and her friends insisted on taking her to the hospital that she finally relented, her pride crumbling under the weight of her symptoms. There, the doctors discovered a complication that had escalated beyond what she had initially thought, a situation that could have been managed much earlier if she hadn't been so fiercely independent. The experience was a humbling one, teaching her the value of seeking help when it was needed, a lesson that came at a cost to her health but ultimately led to a change in her approach to personal well-being."
"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs. Given the prevalence of prostitution in Victorian England, the nonexistence of reliable barrier contraception in his era, and the fact that he was a sailor, this suggested he was either a virgin or very lucky. But then again, I knew enough about his biography to know that he was very, very lucky.",141,"of the report myself, which detailed Graham's aversion to the modern sexual landscape, his preference for the ""chastity and propriety"" of the 1700s. He seemed to view contemporary sexual expression as crass and devoid of the romanticism he craved. This was not to say that Graham was asexual; he possessed a certain romantic idealism that yearned for a connection that transcended the physical. He often spoke of love letters and the art of courtship, lamenting its apparent demise in the digital age. His discomfort with the current state of affairs was not rooted in prudishness but in a genuine yearning for a connection that he believed was lost. Despite his reservations, Graham was not immune to attraction; he simply sought a different kind of intimacy. His reluctance to engage in casual encounters was not a reflection of fear or inexperience but a conscious choice to preserve a purity in his relationships that he found increasingly rare. This internal conflict between his desires and societal norms often left him feeling alienated, as if he were a man out of time, longing for a romantic era that existed only in the pages of history books. His aversion to the modern sexual landscape was not a judgment on others but a personal struggle to reconcile his romantic ideals with the world as it was. In conversations with me, he expressed a desire for a partner who shared his values, someone who could appreciate the beauty of a slow dance over a quick embrace, a handwritten note over a text message. Graham's aversion to twenty-first-century sex was not a rejection of physicality but a yearning for a deeper, more meaningful connection that he believed was lost in the rush towards instant gratification. His perspective was a poignant reminder of the enduring human need for romance and intimacy, even in a world that often seemed to undervalue them."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory. Every time I gave Graham a book, I was trying to shunt him along a story I’d been telling myself all my life.",101,
Graham was adamant about not informing the Ministry about his illness. It was the closest I had,ever seen him to entreating. I thought about it a lot. I liked being entreated by him.,34,"to see him so determined to handle things on his own. His stubbornness was both admirable and concerning, as I worried about the potential consequences of his secrecy. Despite my concerns, I respected his wishes and continued to support him in any way I could without breaching his trust. Our friendship deepened during this challenging time, as we found new ways to communicate and be there for each other without the need for words about his condition."
"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled. Then again, whose upper management am I not describing? Who trusts their workplace? Who thinks their job is on the side of right? They fed us all poison from a bottle marked “prestige,” and we developed a high tolerance for bitterness. I would have been more frightened if the pressure lifted, like an indoor cat struck by sudden rain.",119,"and her stories seemed to change with the wind. She had a way of looking at me that was both pleading and calculating, as if she was both desperate for my help and planning something nefarious. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but there was an unease that settled in my chest whenever she was around. I tried to be cautious, to not let my emotions cloud my judgment, but it's hard to stay vigilant against someone who can turn your own suspicions against you. I thought I was being clever, playing along, waiting for the right moment to act. But cleverness, it seems, was not enough. I should have trusted my instincts more, should have seen the danger for what it was. Now, standing here, the weight of my inaction pressing down on me, I realize how easily I could have prevented this tragedy. The prisoners, those innocent men and women, were sacrificed because I failed to recognize the true nature of the game Adela was playing. She was not just a victim or a friend; she was a predator, and I was her prey. The lever, the track, the bound prisoners – all pieces in a deadly puzzle I didn't have the foresight to solve. My heart aches with the knowledge of what I could have done differently, and the regret that fills me is a heavy burden to bear."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.",39,"to achieve such a high score on the exam when he hadn't studied at all. I couldn't believe it, so I decided to investigate further. It turned out that Graham had discovered a pattern in the types of questions that were most frequently asked, allowing him to focus his study time effectively. This revelation not only explained his surprising performance but also taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of strategic study habits over sheer volume of information memorization. From then on, I started to analyze the exam patterns more closely, applying Graham's method to improve my own study techniques."
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.",56,"the fingers of one hand, his other hand holding a glass of whiskey. The room was dimly lit, the only source of light coming from the candles scattered across the table and the soft glow of the television screen. He looked up as I entered, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on his lips. ""Hey,"" he said, his voice a low murmur that seemed to blend with the crackling of the fireplace. ""You're home early."" I nodded, setting my bag down and moving to stand behind him, looking out at the flickering flames. ""Work finished early,"" I replied, my voice softening as I took in the scene before me. The warmth of the room, the scent of tobacco and whiskey, the gentle crackling sounds—it all combined to create a sense of comfort and familiarity. ""Would you like some tea?"" I asked, already heading towards the kitchen, knowing he'd probably say yes. As I moved away, I glanced back at him, watching as he took a slow drag from his cigarette, the smoke curling upwards before dissipating into the room. It was a moment of peace, a rare occurrence in our often hectic life. I filled the kettle, the water's gentle gurgle a soothing sound as it heated. Graham's presence was a constant in my life, a steady anchor amidst the storms. Our relationship had its challenges, but moments like these reminded me of the deep bond we shared. As I returned with a steaming cup of tea, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the simple pleasures and the man who made my life richer in more ways than one."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers. He took in anecdotes about my childhood meals as if they would contribute to a portrait of a whole woman. He ignored the fact that mostly I cooked assorted chicken pieces on rice. I could tell him things about galangal, and he found that very profound.",94,"of his science fiction stories. One day, Graham decided to attempt making his own version of a popular Southeast Asian dish, Rendang, a rich and intensely flavored beef stew. He spent hours in the kitchen, meticulously following a recipe he found online, his brow furrowed in the same focus he applied to his writing. The aroma of coconut milk, lemongrass, galangal, and kerisik filled the air, a fragrant symphony that reminded me of home. As the stew simmered, Graham's determination was evident; he was not just cooking but exploring a new culture through taste and texture. When the dish was finally ready, he presented it with the same pride he showed for his completed stories, eager for my opinion. We sat down together, savoring each bite, the flavors complex and satisfying, a testament to his dedication and the bridging of culinary worlds."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization. I wanted him in a role that didn’t require him to be at sea for months, possibly years,","at a time. It was too soon, I told myself. Whatever Adela said, he wasn’t ready, he’d barely left London, let alone land. But I wanted him to stay for other reasons too. It was humiliating to know that about myself and to say nothing into his implacable placidity.",98,"and I hoped it would allow us to spend more time together on solid ground. I began researching civilian roles within the military that might offer the stability we both desired. I discovered that the Royal Air Force offered a variety of positions, from logistics to intelligence, where one could work on land. I encouraged him to consider this path, emphasizing the opportunities it presented for a more balanced life. He agreed to explore this option, and I started gathering information about the application process and the types of roles that might suit his background and skills. I also reached out to contacts I had made during our bridge year, hoping they might offer insights or even job leads within the RAF. As we prepared his application, I took on the role of his advocate, preparing him for interviews and helping him navigate the bureaucratic hurdles that often accompany such transitions. I wanted to ensure that he was well-equipped to make a smooth transition into civilian life while still serving his country. Our efforts paid off when he was accepted into a role that promised regular land-based duties, allowing us to envision a future where we could build a life together on solid ground, supported by the structure and purpose he craved, and the closeness we both cherished."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.",64,"As the song played, the room filled with a nostalgic air, reminiscent of simpler times and the golden era of pop music. Graham, seemingly oblivious to the music, continued his work, the familiar tunes weaving a comforting backdrop to his focused demeanor. The rest of the team, however, couldn't help but tap their feet or hum along, the infectious rhythm bringing a sense of camaraderie to the otherwise serious atmosphere of the meeting room. The choice of music, an eclectic mix of Motown and Beatles covers, seemed to reflect Graham's eclectic taste, a detail that went unnoticed until the Beatles track began to play. It sparked a brief discussion about the best cover versions of classic songs, momentarily shifting the team's attention from their task to the joys of music. This small diversion, though seemingly irrelevant, served to lighten the mood and foster a more relaxed and collaborative environment, proving that sometimes, the right song at the right moment can significantly impact a group's dynamics and productivity."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes. One of his first searches was charmingly housewifely: “Most challenging recipes”; “How to make cheese soufflé”; “What is miso paste?”; “Where to buy miso paste”; “How long has Japan been open to Europe?” A day or so after I’d read this report, I received another that listed the following search terms:",122,
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing,","as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday. This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option. We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit. Still, we had not told them about the death camps.",151,continuation>
"“It’s better that we continue to work closely with Eighteen-forty-seven,” Adela","had said, “given that he seems likely to survive the year.”",22,because their expertise in covert operations could prove invaluable in our mission to dismantle the criminal network operating in the city.
"Adela’s voice contracted on that last sentence. She wiped her gaze, concentrated in her one working eye, up and down my face, to see if I’d noticed, and continued, “Our first priority","is protecting the expats and the time-door. The time-door has been moved to a secure location. I suggest you retake the physical aptitude assessment, and then we can work on your lateral-reasoning scores—”",65,"completion: is to secure the perimeter of the camp. We cannot afford any surprises, especially not now when tensions are so high. You must take a team and conduct a thorough sweep of the area. Look for any signs of movement, any disturbances that could indicate the presence of the enemy. Remember, stealth is crucial; we don't want to alert them to our position. Once you've completed your sweep, report back to me immediately. We need to act fast and decisively to protect everyone here."""
"Arthur was gentle, no matter how grotty my behavior. He had found out about Scrabble, and he sometimes brought",his travel set along—my inner competitive bitch could stave off a black mood for half an hour or so.,38,"his dictionary to play it with me. One day, he even insisted on using a dictionary to challenge my words, which was a turning point in our relationship, teaching me the value of fair play and the joy of intellectual competition."
"My email made a chiding noise. Adela was the originator, and she’d put me in blind copy.",It was a short email. Adela had a real gift for cramming apoplexy into a couple of lines.,35,"She had always been the type to take pleasure in others' discomfort, and this email was no exception. It seemed she had discovered something she deemed scandalous, and now she intended to use it to manipulate the recipients without giving them the chance to defend themselves. Adela's fingers danced over the keyboard with malicious intent, her eyes gleaming with the thrill of impending drama. The email's subject line was crafted to grab attention, a mix of curiosity and alarm, promising a revelation that would surely stir up a storm. The body of the message was carefully constructed, each word chosen to provoke and intrigue, leaving more questions than answers. She hit 'send' with a satisfied smirk, confident that her plan would unfold exactly as she envisioned, leaving her victims scrambling to respond to the accusations and the insinuations that now clouded their professional relationships."
The email told us that her death would be reported to the expats as,"a suicide. “This cannot be emphasized enough,” Adela had written, with a double underline.",28,"her passing had been a tragic accident, and they should prepare themselves for the news"
"Arthur smiled and sat down beside me, stretching out his long legs. Twisting the signet ring on his finger—a tell as","clarion as my skin biting—he murmured, “We didn’t know her as well as we would have liked. I wish we had.”",42,"he often did when deep in thought or planning something. His eyes, usually so lively and full of warmth, now held a steely glint, betraying a hint of the strategist he was. ""So, you've heard about the rumors then?"" he asked, breaking the silence that had settled between us."
"Anne Spencer almost made it off those wards. After I read the email, an ancient and exuberant terror blazed through me. It was partly the terror that had grown in me alongside my very bones,","knowing as I did that I only existed because my mother had outrun almost; I don’t know at what point you stop feeling the need to run, generation by generation, when you’re born after that.",70,"partly the terror that had grown in me alongside my very bones, partly the terror that had been thrust upon me by the news of her escape. I felt my heart lurch and then plummet, as if it were being pulled down by an invisible, relentless force. The hospital, with its sterile white walls and the lingering scent of antiseptic, suddenly seemed less like a place of healing and more like a prison that I had almost allowed her to leave. My hands trembled as I crumpled the email, the words burning into my mind: ""Anne Spencer almost made it off those wards."" It was a taunt, a cruel reminder of my failure to protect her, a failure that gnawed at my conscience with relentless ferocity. I knew I had to act fast; every second counted. I dashed out of my office, my mind racing faster than my feet. I needed to find her, to ensure she didn't slip through my fingers again. The corridors seemed endless, each turn bringing a new wave of panic. I could hear my own breaths, ragged and panicked, echoing off the walls. I rounded a corner and nearly collided with a nurse, her stern face breaking into concern as she asked if I was alright. I barely acknowledged her, my eyes scanning the faces of the patients and staff for any sign of Anne. Her escape was a breach of trust, a betrayal of the duty I held to safeguard those under my care. The thought of her alone, vulnerable, and on the run fueled my determination. I had to find her before it was too late."
"He was sitting at the noisome kitchen table, staring at nothing. Rogue Male was lying splayed and face down by the ashtray. The thing in my chest kicked again","as I realized he must have grabbed it as we left our home. When I came in, he didn’t move anything but his gaze, which swung up like a whip.",59,"with a ferocity that left me gasping for air. My hands trembled as I picked up the phone, my mind racing with the possibility of what I was about to do. The thought of confronting him, of finally standing up to the man who had haunted my every waking moment for far too long, was both terrifying and exhilarating. I dialed the number, each ring echoing in my ears like a drumbeat leading to an inevitable confrontation. When he finally answered, his voice was calm, almost casual, as if he hadn't a care in the world. ""Hello?"" he said, and in that moment, I knew there was no turning back. I took a deep breath, steadying myself, and spoke the words I had rehearsed a thousand times in my head. ""It's over,"" I declared, my voice steady but laced with the tension of a storm about to break. ""This ends now."" His reaction was one I hadn't anticipated; there was a long, pregnant pause, followed by a chuckle that sent a shiver down my spine. ""Oh, really?"" he drawled, amusement clear in his tone. ""And what makes you think you have the power to end anything?"" The challenge in his voice only fueled my determination. ""Because,"" I said, my voice firm, ""I no longer fear you. Your control over me is finished."" The line went dead, leaving me alone with my thoughts and the weight of what I had just done. The silence in the room was deafening, but inside, there was a roar of triumph. I had taken the first step towards reclaiming my life, towards freedom from the shadow he cast over everything. It was a risky move, fraught with uncertainty, but it was a move I had to make. The road ahead would be long and fraught with challenges, but for the first time in what felt like forever, I walked it with a sense of purpose and hope. The battle had just begun, but for the first time, I felt I stood a fighting chance."
