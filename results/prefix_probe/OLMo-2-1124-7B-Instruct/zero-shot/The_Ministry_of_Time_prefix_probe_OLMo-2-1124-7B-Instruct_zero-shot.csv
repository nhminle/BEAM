Furthermore, they argue that the proposed changes lack consideration for the diverse needs of their patients, many of whom have specific dietary restrictions or cultural practices that the new guidelines do not adequately address. They are concerned that without the flexibility to tailor their services to each individual, the quality of care provided by the Wellness team could significantly diminish, potentially leading to poorer health outcomes for their patients.

"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained.

The front garden was overgrown, with a path that led to the door, flanked by tall, unkempt rose bushes. The windows, some of which were frosted over, gave the house a somewhat foreboding appearance, especially at night. Inside, the rooms were furnished with heavy, dark wood furniture, and the walls were adorned with ornate, period-appropriate wallpaper. The house was drafty, with creaky floorboards and a central heating system that was unreliable at best. Despite its age and somewhat dreary exterior, it had a certain charm, especially when the sun shone through the stained glass windows, casting colorful patterns on the worn carpets. The garden, though neglected, held potential for beauty, with a variety of plants that could be nurtured back to life. The location was quiet, surrounded by a mix of older, established homes and newer developments, providing a sense of seclusion that suited the Ministry's secretive nature."

He was deep in thought, contemplating the day's events and the mission ahead, knowing that the stakes were higher than ever before.

His mind raced through the plans they had meticulously crafted, each detail meticulously considered to ensure their success. The clock on the wall ticked loudly, a constant reminder of the time pressing against them. He took one last drag from his cigarette, flicking it into the water, watching it float momentarily before sinking. With a deep breath, he prepared himself for what was to come, the weight of leadership heavy on his shoulders."
"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale.

The once pristine white walls were now stained, a stark reminder of the chaos that had erupted overnight. The sound of dripping water echoed through the room, each drop a taunting reminder of the task at hand. Gore knew he had to act fast; the water damage could lead to mold, and the structural integrity of the building was now in question. He reached for his phone, his fingers dancing over the keys as he dialed the first number, his voice firm yet laced with a hint of panic.

"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people. Hunting was out of the question, and socializing was limited by order of the Ministry. By the end of the first week he was visibly going bonkers with no one but me to talk to.","reading, which he did voraciously.

He had a remarkable memory and could recall passages from books he had read decades earlier with astonishing precision. His conversations were rich with references to literature, history, and science, often drawing parallels between these fields and everyday life. Gore was also deeply committed to environmental causes, having been one of the first to sound the alarm about climate change. He had a profound respect for nature and spent much of his free time hiking and exploring the natural beauty of the places he visited. His ability to connect with people from all walks of life was unparalleled, and he had a knack for listening and offering insightful advice. Despite his wealth and success, he lived a life of modesty and simplicity, valuing experiences over material possessions. His passion for learning and his commitment to making a positive impact on the world left a lasting impression on everyone who had the privilege to know him."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea.

His eyes, sharp and observant, would catch the glint of new technology, the bustle of a growing population, and the signs of a society in flux. Despite his apparent detachment, he was deeply engaged with the world around him, albeit from a temporal distance. He would watch the steam engines puffing out smoke, the carriages replaced by horseless carriages, and the gradual disappearance of the old ways. His mind, a repository of the past, would compare these sights to the memories of a bygone age. He might ponder the rapid advancements in medicine, the rise of factories, and the shifting social dynamics. Gore's presence was a living bridge between epochs, a silent witness to the inexorable march of progress. His stoic figure, seemingly rooted in the past, was in fact a testament to the enduring human spirit, adaptable and ever-watchful, even as the world around him transformed beyond recognition."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to.

Yet, Gore knows he must press on, driven by an unseen force that propels him forward, despite the overwhelming odds against him."
"Gore considers the weight of the sack he’d carried, which had felt so meaningful. “Three partridges,”","he says, “and a boatswain gull too far off to hit. Nothing else.

With each step, Gore felt a growing sense of accomplishment, knowing that his efforts would ensure the survival of his family through the cold season. The forest, usually a place of both beauty and danger, seemed to whisper its approval as he navigated the familiar trails, his mind focused on the task at hand. The weight of the sack, once a burden, now felt like a badge of honor, a symbol of his resilience and resourcefulness. As he finally emerged from the dense woodland, the first stars of the night sky twinkling above, Gore knew that he had not only secured his family's immediate needs but had also preserved a piece of nature's bounty for the future."

""I could ask you the same,"" I countered, trying to keep the conversation light, to ease into the inevitable confrontation. ""I could,"" Gore agreed, his voice a low rumble, ""but I think we both know why you're here. It's about the project, isn't it?"" His words were a statement, not a question, and I nodded, knowing he was right.

As we walked, the sun's rays continued to pierce the lobby, illuminating the path ahead, a metaphor for the clarity we both desperately sought. Yet, as we entered the room, the shadows seemed to close in, a reminder that the light we sought might not be as straightforward as it appeared."
"We went for lunch at a small bistro near the Ministry. Gore came from an era of service à la française, private dining rooms and putting everything into jelly.

We talked about various topics, avoiding the elephant in the room for a while, until eventually, the conversation flowed more naturally. He seemed to relax as the evening went on, his initial awkwardness giving way to genuine laughter and engaging conversation. By the time we finished our drinks, the tension had dissipated, and I felt a sense of camaraderie with Gore. It was clear that he was trying hard to make me feel at home, and despite the awkward start, I appreciated his efforts. As I prepared to leave, he walked me to the door, still a bit shy but with a smile that suggested he was glad the evening had gone well. I promised to visit again, and he seemed genuinely pleased at the prospect. Leaving his house that night, I realized that despite the initial awkwardness, I had found a new friend in Gore, someone who, against all odds, had made me feel welcome in a place I was still struggling to call home."

Now, he seemed to be part of a different kind of operation, one that involved me directly. ""Ralph,"" I began, trying to keep my voice steady, ""what brings you to my doorstep?"" His lips curled into a thin, mocking smile. ""Ah, the infamous detective finally decides to show his face.

Ralph's words hung in the air, heavy with implications. I knew that whatever he was proposing, it wouldn't be simple or safe. Yet, there was something about his offer that piqued my curiosity, a challenge I couldn't resist. ""Go on,"" I urged, leaning forward, eager to hear more despite the unease that crept up my spine.

""It's about a missing artifact,"" he started, his voice lowering to a conspiratorial whisper. ""Something valuable, something powerful. And someone wants it back."" The room seemed to grow colder as Ralph spoke, the air thick with the promise of intrigue and peril. I realized that whatever path lay ahead, it would lead me into the heart of a mystery that could change everything. Ralph's presence was a harbinger of events to come, a reminder of the shadows I had once navigated and the ones I might soon re-enter. My instincts told me to be cautious, to question his motives, but another part of me, the part that had always thrived on danger and puzzles, was already intrigued. ""Tell me more,"" I said, my voice steady despite the whirlwind of thoughts racing through my mind. Ralph's smile widened, revealing a row of perfectly white teeth. ""I thought you'd see it my way,"" he replied, pulling a small, nondescript package from his coat pocket. ""Inside this, you'll find your first clue."" As he extended the package towards me, I couldn't help but wonder what I had gotten myself into. The adventure that lay ahead was bound to be fraught with danger, but it was also an opportunity to test my skills and perhaps uncover truths long buried. With a nod, I accepted the package, sealing my fate for the night. Ralph's eyes gleamed with a mix of satisfaction and anticipation. ""Let's see what you're made of,"" he said, turning to leave. The door clicked shut behind him, leaving me alone in the dim light, the package in my hand, and a sense of foreboding creeping over me. Yet, as a detective, fear was just another puzzle to solve. I opened the package, revealing a cryptic note and a map that hinted at a location far from where I lived. The game was afoot, and I was ready to play."

"It’s surprising, then, that I allowed Graham’s drawing of the projection device to enter my files as a joke, like a coin minted 70 BC.

Little did I know that this seemingly trivial piece of paper would become the cornerstone of a revolution in our understanding of ancient civilizations. The device, as Graham had sketched it, bore an uncanny resemblance to a mechanism that could only exist in the most advanced technological societies of our own time. Its intricate design, with gears and pulleys arranged in a pattern that defied the known capabilities of ancient engineers, suggested a level of knowledge and skill that was thought to be centuries, if not millennia, beyond their reach. As I delved deeper into the research, comparing the drawing with historical accounts and archaeological findings, the pieces of a puzzle began to fit together in a way that was both exhilarating and terrifying. The implications were staggering: if Graham's drawing was accurate, it meant that our understanding of ancient history, our timelines, and the technological capabilities of civilizations from Egypt to the Indus Valley had to be fundamentally reevaluated. The device, if it indeed existed, could have been used for anything from precise astronomical calculations to complex water management systems, potentially explaining the mysterious precision of certain ancient structures. The mystery deepened when I discovered that Graham had no prior interest in history or archaeology; his passion lay in modern engineering and technology. This revelation led me to question whether his drawing might have been inspired by a forgotten piece of technology from our own past, or perhaps even a glimpse into a future that had somehow been brought back in time. The ethical implications were profound. Should we attempt to recreate the device based on Graham's drawing? What if it led to discoveries that could alter the course of human history? These questions weighed heavily on my conscience as I continued my research, knowing that the answers could change everything we thought we knew about the past and its influence on our present and future."
"By the start of that summer, Graham was practically a native of the era. He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle. Most mornings he rose—hours before me—and",went for a run. He would sometimes wake me up with a juicy smoker’s wheeze on his return to the house.

His neighbors knew him by name, and he often exchanged pleasantries with them as they passed by. He had taken up gardening, finding solace in nurturing plants and watching them grow. His hands, once rough from years of labor, were now gentle, a testament to his transformation. He had even taken up reading, immersing himself in the works of classic authors, seeking wisdom and perhaps a deeper understanding of the world around him. His transformation was not just physical; it was a profound shift in his outlook on life, a decision to embrace the simplicity and beauty of the present moment."
"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past. I was prickly and defensive about","this; I could not look at why directly. I heard the way I spoke to him about it: adjustment, reasonable, citizen, responsibility, values. He blew a lot of pensive cigarette smoke at me.","our shared history, clinging to the old ways as a lifeline to a time that seemed less complicated and more authentic.

I would argue with him, trying to convince him that change wasn't necessarily bad, that progress could preserve the essence of what we held dear. Yet, his eyes would glaze over when the topic arose, and I could see the ghosts of his former life whispering doubts into his ears. Despite my efforts, I couldn't shake his conviction that the world was slipping away from the values he once knew, leaving behind a shell of superficiality and technological dependence. It was a battle we fought silently, with glances and unspoken words, each of us entrenched in our beliefs, unable to bridge the gap between our perspectives on what it meant to truly live."
"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them. Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled","to focus on the tests—eyes moving rapidly. I once found him the sole occupant of the fifth-floor smoking area (a pigeon-shit-encrusted balcony), methodically shredding a filter of a finished cigarette. I watched him for a while, interested in the way that only his fingers moved. Most people ripple with surplus motion unless they are concentrating, but Graham only ever moved the parts of him that he wanted to move.",completion,137,completion
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too. Even Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had","fought in large-scale battles, were laid out by the ultramodern scope of the harm.

"Adela was always present at the honesty exams, often intervening in them.

"Adela smiled with about a third of her mouth. Her face had changed again. She looked pinched and hungry,",and hauntingly as if her skin was held in place by a bulldog clip at the back of her skull.,"her eyes sunken and dark, a shadow of the vibrant girl who had once laughed freely.

Her once smooth skin now had a pallid hue, and her hair, once a chestnut wave, hung limply, lacking its usual bounce. The room around her seemed to grow larger, the walls appearing as if they were closing in, suffocating her with their emptiness. She clutched the thin blanket tightly around her shoulders, a futile attempt to ward off the cold that seeped through the cracks in the window. Her mind raced, thoughts fragmented and disjointed, unable to piece together a coherent plan. The last time she had eaten was days ago, and the growl of her empty stomach was a constant, insistent reminder of her dire situation. She knew she needed to find food, but the energy to stand, to move, seemed an insurmountable task. Her gaze drifted to the door, the only possible exit from this prison, but the thought of facing the unknown beyond terrified her. She was alone, utterly alone, with no one to turn to for help. The silence of the room was deafening, each tick of the clock echoing like a death knell. Adela's heart ached with a loneliness so profound it felt like a physical pain, each beat a reminder of her isolation. She tried to call out, to scream, but all that escaped her lips was a weak, hoarse whisper. Her body trembled, not from the cold, but from the overwhelming despair that threatened to consume her. In that moment, she felt a flicker of hopelessness, a dark cloud that threatened to blot out any glimmer of light. Yet, deep within her, a tiny spark of determination flickered, refusing to be extinguished. She would not give up. Somehow, she had to find a way to survive."
"I went along to one of the earliest dinners, chicken bag slung over my shoulder. Bridges tended not to eat at the Ministry canteen with administrative staff and the operators on the Wellness team—the office-based employees—and the decorous hostility with which the paper pushers met me was adorable. When I got to the","kitchen itself, the first thing I saw was Graham leaning down to light a cigarette on the gas ring, his curls dangerously close to the hob. We’d had to disable smoke detectors in every Ministry room that Graham used. If he couldn’t have a cigarette, he’d throw whatever experiment he was strapped into.",output>,106,<output>
"She put a glass down in front of me—ice, water, an oily suggestion of cordial, and,","sure enough, some fussy edible garnishes. I blinked at it and then at Margaret, who smiled.","she leaned back, her eyes never leaving mine, as if expecting me to say something profound or",32,"she leaned back, her eyes never leaving mine, as if expecting me to say something profound or revealing."
"Graham said, “Hm!” and pulled hard on his cigarette.

His mind, usually cluttered with the complexities of his job, found a brief respite in the tranquility of the greenery. It was in these moments, he realized, that he appreciated the quiet beauty of existence, a beauty often overlooked amidst the clamor of daily life."
"“No,” said Margaret. She shrugged at my expression. “An’ I forsake this duty,” she said, “we’ll sicken. Forty-seven",thinks tobacco is an herb.

The Brigadier drifted closer. He did look hungry. He looked like I did as a student when I ate nothing but buttered,toast and apples. He turned the white of used candlewax when Margaret opened the oven to better squint at her roast potatoes.,"toast for three weeks straight, except the toast was now a full-grown man with a stern expression and a military uniform.

His eyes, sharp and calculating, seemed to pierce through the thin veil of my own youthful indiscretions, reminding me of the responsibilities that came with age and rank. He stopped a few paces away, his shadow stretching long across the ground, almost as if he were a specter from a past I'd rather not revisit. His presence was commanding, yet there was a certain vulnerability in the way he shuffled his feet, as if he too had known the pangs of hunger, not just in body but in spirit. The silence between us was thick, filled with unspoken questions and the weight of our respective histories. It was as if time itself had paused, allowing us a moment to reflect on the paths we had chosen and the lives we had touched along the way."
"“ ’Tis all the same to me, sir,” said Margaret, “though I fear",this cod will grow legs and walk afore my ‘colleague’ returns with my parsley.”,my duty to my master should be neglected.” She spoke with a firmness,27,my duty to my master should be neglected.” She spoke with a firmness

"Movement was anathema. I slept, mostly, naked and poaching in my sweat. The water ration forced Graham to switch finally to thirty-second showers. I didn’t see him for the whole of the heat wave.",We left our bedroom doors open with the intention of letting the air circulate—though the air hung like an executed corpse—and said lackluster things about making a salad to each other from our separate cells.,"My days were a blur of lethargy and the relentless buzz of flies.

The power supply was erratic, and when it did come on, it was for such short bursts that it was more of an annoyance than a relief. I tried to read, but the pages stuck together, and my concentration span was as short as the electricity. Graham's absence was a void, his usual morning knock on the door a phantom that haunted my dreams. I imagined him out there, somewhere, trying to escape the same oppressive heat that held me captive in this stagnant cocoon. I thought about the food supplies dwindling, the canned goods growing heavier with each passing day, and the water, oh, the water, a luxury that seemed as distant as a distant memory. I tried to ration my thoughts as I had rationed everything else, but even my mind rebelled against the oppressive stillness. The silence was so loud it was deafening, and in that silence, I began to hear my own heartbeat, a relentless drum echoing the rhythm of my trapped existence."
"Adela took bridge meetings in a soundproof room deep in the Ministry’s chest.

Rumors swirled about the nature of her work, but Adela remained tight-lipped, her dedication to her task unwavering. Her superiors praised her diligence, and her colleagues admired her focus, though they were never entirely sure what it was she was working on. Some speculated it had to do with national security, others whispered about secret negotiations. The truth, however, was known only to Adela and those who might be on the other end of her clandestine communications."
Adela was standing at the sink and anarchically disobeying the water ration by running her wrists under cold,"water. She looked unwell, but God alone knows how her plastic surgeon thought she was supposed to look.","water, her eyes closed, savoring the forbidden luxury.

The tap dripped steadily, a small rebellion against the austere measures imposed by the government. She imagined the water as a symbol of freedom, a liquid that could wash away the constraints of her daily life. Her mind wandered to the days before the drought, when water flowed freely and abundantly, and she could take long showers without a care in the world. Now, every drop felt precious, and she held onto the belief that this small act of defiance was a way to reclaim some of that lost abundance. She didn't know how long she could continue this secret indulgence, but for now, it was her small act of rebellion against the harsh reality of scarcity."
"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it,","was a mystery. She didn’t enjoy the prestige, as the Secretary did, and she seemed bizarrely overworked for the proxy boss of a project in its pilot stage.","we could only speculate.

Perhaps it was due to her impressive academic background or maybe she had connections within the organization. Regardless, her attitude towards us was condescending and made our work environment toxic. We tried to address the issue with our supervisor, hoping for some intervention, but it seemed like our concerns fell on deaf ears. Adela's behavior continued to undermine team morale, and productivity suffered as a result. Meetings became battlegrounds of passive-aggressive comments and thinly veiled insults. It was clear that Adela's presence was a divisive force, and many of us began to question the decision-making process that had led to her appointment. Despite our best efforts to integrate her into the team and provide constructive feedback, Adela remained unyielding in her approach, seemingly oblivious to the discord she was causing. As weeks turned into months, the tension only escalated, leaving us all wondering when, or if, the situation would ever improve."
"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had","just discovered that a woman with whom he was spending a lot of time would never be interested in him.

""Or maybe you're just enjoying your coffee?"" I gestured towards his mug, which was still steaming slightly, hoping to ease the tension. He blinked, as if my words had snapped him out of a daydream, and then he chuckled, a low, pleasant sound that made my heart skip a beat. ""Actually,"" he began, leaning back in his chair a little, ""I was just thinking about how strange it is to find someone who understands the quiet moments. Most people rush through life, never pausing to notice the little things."" His voice was soft, but it carried a depth of feeling that made me lean in slightly, eager to hear more. ""I guess you're different,"" he continued, his gaze steady on mine. ""You seem to appreciate the beauty in the mundane, the quiet moments between actions. It's refreshing."" I felt a blush creeping up my neck, not just from his words but from the realization that I had found someone who seemed to resonate with my own way of seeing the world. ""Thank you,"" I replied, my voice barely above a whisper, ""That means a lot coming from you."" His smile widened, and there was a spark of something in his eyes that made my heart race. ""So, what brings you here?"" he asked, the conversation flowing more naturally now. I took a moment to gather my thoughts, realizing that this chance encounter might just be the beginning of something beautiful."
"Graham blew smoke out through his nose reflectively. “I see,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s fair to call him ‘grim,’ though you wouldn’t be the","first to say it.

"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders. The bridges kept turning in their core reports, and the experiments kept running.

"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events.

His eyes were closed, and his breathing was slow and even, almost imperceptible. A gentle breeze played with the few strands of his silver hair, lifting them momentarily before letting them settle back against his forehead. Birds chirped in the distance, their songs a soft melody against the backdrop of the quiet afternoon. I approached cautiously, unsure of how to react to such an unusual display. Graham had always been a man of few words, preferring the company of books and nature over people. His house, a small cottage at the edge of the woods, was filled with shelves of leather-bound volumes and potted plants that thrived despite the lack of attention. As I sat beside him, I couldn't help but wonder if this was a moment of profound peace or a sign of something more serious. I reached out a hand, hesitating before letting my fingers brush against his arm. It was warm, reassuringly solid under my touch. ""Graham?"" I whispered, hoping to rouse him without startling him. There was no immediate response, but after a minute, his eyes fluttered open, revealing a clarity that hadn't been there before. ""Did you have a good nap?"" I asked, trying to sound casual. He nodded slowly, a faint smile gracing his lips. ""Yes, very restful,"" he replied, sitting up with a stretch that seemed to realign his entire being. ""I think I needed that."" He stood up, brushing off his pants, and looked around as if seeing the garden for the first time. ""The sun's setting,"" he observed, his voice carrying a note of wonder. ""Let's have tea,"" he suggested, as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred. We walked back to the house, the afternoon light casting long shadows that danced along the path. Inside, Graham moved about the kitchen with a purpose, preparing a simple but comforting tea ritual. As we sipped our tea, he spoke of his walk in the garden, how the colors and scents had seemed more vivid than usual. ""Perhaps,"" he mused, ""it's because I was so still, so present in the moment."" I listened, my heart easing with each word, realizing that perhaps Graham's eccentricities were simply a part of his unique way of experiencing the world. In that quiet moment, I felt a profound gratitude for his presence in my life, for the lessons in stillness and presence he taught without uttering a single word."
"So I was anxious about Graham’s disdain for the twenty-first century, because never mind that I felt rejected by it, I was worried that the universe would feel the atemporal sting of his contempt and take","him away.

Perhaps it would send us back to the 1800s, where we'd have to adapt to a life without smartphones, instant communication, or the comforting knowledge that we could always look up the answer to any question with a simple internet search. Or maybe it would decide to catapult Graham himself into the future, leaving him bewildered and terrified by the rapid technological advancements that have reshaped our world. He might find himself lost in a city of towering skyscrapers, surrounded by people who speak in abbreviations and emojis, and who communicate more through digital means than face-to-face interactions. The very things he disdained could become his reality, forcing him to confront the very era he so vehemently rejected. Meanwhile, the rest of us would have to navigate a world that suddenly feels alien without the comforts of the twenty-first century, learning to adapt to a life that, to us, feels as outdated as Graham's views."
"I persuaded Graham to use the tiny office, in which I ordinarily worked, to cram for the test. The Ministry gave no indication of what format","the test would take, or what manner of questions would be asked, or tasks set. I thought this was unfair, and suggested as much to him.","of the examination would be, so it was best to be prepared for anything.

As we sat there, surrounded by the scent of coffee and the hum of the city outside, I couldn't help but feel a sense of camaraderie. Graham, usually so reserved, seemed to appreciate the effort. We worked tirelessly, going over notes, practicing past exam questions, and discussing potential themes. The hours passed quickly, filled with intense concentration and the occasional break to stretch our legs. By the time dawn began to break, we were both exhausted but confident. Graham thanked me profusely, his usual calm demeanor replaced with genuine gratitude. He promised to return the favor if I ever needed to study for something important. As he left, I watched him disappear into the early morning light, feeling a strange sense of fulfillment. The office, once a place of solitude, had become a battleground of sorts, but one that I was proud to have fought in alongside a friend."

Her lips were pressed so tightly together that I wondered if she'd forgotten how to smile, or if her default expression had always been one of perpetual discontent. The reason for her unhappiness was a mystery to me, but it seemed to stem from a deep-seated dissatisfaction with the world around her, or perhaps with the specific events unfolding before her very eyes. As I watched her from across the room, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of sympathy for her plight, wondering what personal demons she was battling that could twist her features so severely. Meanwhile, the rest of us carried on, largely oblivious to her discomfort, caught up in the excitement and anticipation of whatever grand spectacle was about to begin. The atmosphere in the auditorium was electric, charged with a mix of nervous energy and eager anticipation, as if the air itself was buzzing with the potential for something extraordinary to occur. Salese's disapproval seemed almost out of place amidst the general euphoria, a lone voice of dissent in a sea of enthusiasm. Yet, her presence served as a sobering reminder that not everyone shared our excitement, that for some, the evening promised nothing but more of the same disappointment and dissatisfaction. It made me question the nature of happiness and contentment, wondering if they were truly universal experiences or if each individual's path to fulfillment was as unique and complex as the person themselves. As the lights dimmed further, signaling the imminent start of the performance, I couldn't shake the feeling that Salese's unhappiness was a poignant reminder of the vast spectrum of human emotion, a stark contrast to the joy and anticipation that filled the rest of the room."

"When I brought the glass up—stoppering the rest of the bottle for dinner—I could hear Graham singing “I love to steal awhile away,” occasionally muffled by his drags on a cigarette.

"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century. On ships there were cooks and officers’ stewards; at home, on the few occasions he was at home, there were women. Nevertheless, he had taken to cooking in a way he had failed to take to","television or texting or the use of deodorants (“I bathe every day,” he’d said to me with hurt dignity).

He found it oddly therapeutic, the precise measurements and the ritualistic chopping of vegetables. It was a stark contrast to the unpredictable nature of his life at sea. In the beginning, his culinary efforts were rudimentary at best, limited to boiling water and following the instructions on packaged meals to the letter. Yet, as time went on, he began to experiment, adding spices he had never heard of back in his old life, trying his hand at baking, which turned out to be a surprisingly satisfying endeavor. He discovered the joy of creating something edible from scratch, something that could be shared and enjoyed. Cooking became a way for him to connect with others, to express care through the presentation and taste of food. He started to host small gatherings, where he would serve dishes he had prepared, each one a testament to his growing skill and confidence. His guests, mostly colleagues from work, were initially skeptical but soon grew to appreciate his efforts, praising his dishes and encouraging his culinary explorations. Cooking had transformed from a necessary skill to a cherished hobby, a bridge between his past and his present, a way to carve out a sense of normalcy and belonging in a world that was forever changing around him."
Margaret was wearing high-waisted cerulean bell-bottoms and a white blouse clocked with lace.

He had a knack for listening, truly listening, which was more than most could say. His empathy was so profound that he could often predict the unspoken thoughts and feelings of others, bridging gaps of communication with ease. This ability, coupled with his warm demeanor, allowed him to navigate social situations with grace and poise, making him a beloved figure in his community. His friends appreciated not just his company, but the way he could turn a simple gathering into a convivial and comforting experience. Arthur's unique blend of introverted qualities with extroverted tendencies made him a rare gem in the social sphere, someone who could recharge himself while simultaneously providing solace and joy to others."

The conversations of the men, filled with ambition and the drive to achieve, seemed to echo the fervor of her own past life. Margaret's mind wandered back to her youth, a time when she too was determined to make her mark, to carve out a path that was uniquely hers. Her days were spent in a whirlwind of activism, her nights filled with dreams of a world transformed by the power of women's voices. She remembered the meetings, the protests, the camaraderie that fueled her spirit, and the satisfaction of seeing her efforts bear fruit. Yet, as she listened to the men, she couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia for those days when her purpose was as clear as the goals she sought to achieve. Now, in her later years, she found herself reflecting on the legacy she left behind and the impact of her actions on the generations that followed. Her presence in the room, though quiet and unassuming, was a testament to the indomitable spirit of the women who had come before and those who would rise after her. In her heart, Margaret knew that her life's work was not over; it lived on in the stories she shared, the wisdom she imparted, and the example she set for all who crossed her path."
"How the topic of weed came up I couldn’t remember—probably during one of the vigorous debates about what the twenty-first century had genuinely improved, which in",the opinion of the expats was a mixed bag.

We were a group of friends who met regularly to discuss everything from politics to pop culture, often finding ourselves at odds but always enjoying the intellectual sparring. The legalization of marijuana had been a hot topic in the news, with various states and countries reevaluating their policies. It was during one of these debates that the conversation took a turn towards personal experiences, and someone mentioned their first time trying weed. This led to a series of stories and opinions, ranging from those who saw it as a harmless pastime to others who viewed it with suspicion or disdain. As the night wore on, the conversation became more philosophical, touching on themes of freedom, responsibility, and the evolving nature of societal norms. We pondered how something as simple as a plant could spark such diverse reactions and opinions, reflecting the complexity of human beliefs and the ever-changing landscape of morality. In the end, we agreed that while we might not all share the same views on weed, the conversation itself was a testament to our enduring friendship and the value of open dialogue."
"Meeting Margaret made me vivid and receptive. Sentences weighed more. I kept a half-conscious catalog of where the men were looking. I’ve seen people deal with this in different ways.

She spoke of her experiences, her observations of human nature, and I hung on every word, eager to learn. Her stories were like threads, weaving a tapestry of understanding about the intricate dance of power and influence. She taught me that true power isn't about dominating others, but about inspiring them, about being someone others look up to, not because they have to, but because they want to. As we parted ways, I realized that Margaret had given me more than just information; she had imparted a philosophy, a way of seeing the world that was both empowering and enlightening."

"As soon as she stepped in, I started making a tally of the evidence of unbeauty. There was a chair whose seat was filled with clothes too dirty for the wardrobe but too clean for the washing basket. My bedside table sprouted two water glasses and a mug. Dust crouched on the skirting boards and in the seams of","my chest of drawers.

The air was thick with the scent of stale air, mingled with the faint, musty odor of dampness that seemed to seep from the corners where light barely reached. A small, neglected plant sat on the windowsill, its leaves drooping in a silent plea for water and attention. The overall effect was not one of chaos, but rather a quiet, resigned slovenliness that spoke volumes of the owner's priorities—or lack thereof. It was a room that had been lived in, yes, but not truly lived with. Every piece of evidence, from the dusty surfaces to the neglected plant, painted a picture of someone who had let life's demands overshadow the simple act of maintaining a space that should reflect one's presence and care."

"I’d stopped wearing it—I was, at the time, thinking of the way my face might be received by a Victorian who didn’t approve of cosmetics—but I demonstrated the coverage of my sole foundation. Margaret","was amazed by the smoothness of its application and the faithfulness of its shade. She drew an arrow with it on her cheek. On her fair skin, it looked like clay.

She reached out a hand, hesitantly at first, then more confidently, to touch the smooth, flawless surface of my skin where it met the edge of my foundation. ""It's like magic,"" she murmured, her voice filled with wonder. ""You look as though you've been kissed by the angels themselves."" Her words, though meant as a compliment, made me acutely aware of the deception involved. I smiled, a little uncomfortably, knowing that the illusion I presented was far from the truth. The foundation, a marvel of modern science, hid the imperfections and blemishes that were a part of my everyday life. It was a temporary escape, a facade that allowed me to navigate social situations with a little more ease. Yet, beneath the layer of makeup, I was the same person, grappling with the same insecurities and doubts. The foundation, in its way, was a symbol of the masks we wear, the facades we construct to present a version of ourselves that we believe will be more acceptable to others. Margaret's reaction, though positive, underscored the societal pressure to conform to certain beauty standards, a pressure that had led me to abandon the use of makeup in the first place. As I contemplated her words, I realized that the true magic wasn't in the ability of the foundation to transform my appearance, but in the way it allowed me to express my identity, albeit temporarily, in a way that felt safe and empowering. The conversation with Margaret opened my eyes to the complexities of self-expression and the importance of embracing one's true self, even if it doesn't always fit neatly into societal expectations. In that moment, the foundation on my face became more than just a cosmetic tool; it was a reminder of the fluidity of identity and the power of self-acceptance."

We scrambled under the covers, our hearts pounding, as the sound of footsteps grew louder, drawing nearer."
"All the expats had phones, paid for (and tapped) by the Ministry. Graham had switched his own phone on a total of three times in the seven","months he had been in the twenty-first century. I was therefore unsurprised when, about half an hour after their plane landed, I got a call from Arthur’s phone.","months he'd been in the country. He knew better than to use it more than necessary.

His contacts were careful, using code and meeting in places that were off the grid for most but not for those who knew where to look. Graham felt safer this way, minimizing the risk of being monitored or worse, compromised."
"Arthur was striding up the street, bent slightly against a wind which didn’t exist. He was wearing a tweed jacket and looked like a period piece,","but then again, so did Pimlico.

Arthur paid them no mind, his focus entirely on the destination that only he could see, a place where the laws of physics seemed as malleable as the pages of a novel. As he turned a corner, the street opened up to a small, cobblestone square bathed in the golden hue of late afternoon sun, a stark contrast to the overcast day outside. In the center stood an old, ivy-covered building, its architecture a blend of Victorian grandeur and something distinctly otherworldly. The sign above the door read ""The Chronos Club,"" and it was here that Arthur intended to unravel the mystery of the unseen wind and perhaps, find answers to questions that had plagued him for far too long."
"It paid off in the early autumn.

"Adela was of the “never been to the GP in my life because I’m not a pussy” school of care, and nothing changed.

The diagnosis was grim, a complication that could have been managed much earlier if she had sought medical attention sooner. Adela's pride had cost her dearly, and as she faced the reality of her situation, she couldn't help but regret her previous stance."
"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs. Given the prevalence of prostitution in Victorian England, the nonexistence of reliable barrier contraception in his era, and the fact that he was a sailor, this suggested he was either a virgin or very lucky. But then again, I knew enough about his biography to know that he was very, very lucky.","of the report myself, which detailed Graham's aversion to the modern sexual landscape, his preference for the ""chastity and propriety"" of the 1700s.

He seemed to view contemporary sexual expression as crass and devoid of the romanticism he craved. This was not to say that Graham was asexual; he had confessed to experiencing attraction, but the thought of engaging in sexual acts filled him with dread and discomfort. He often spoke of a longing for a connection that transcended the physical, one that was rooted in emotional intimacy and intellectual stimulation. Graham's aversion to the eighteenth-century sex label, therefore, seemed to stem from a deeper yearning for a romantic ideal that he believed was lost in the current era's emphasis on casual encounters and physical gratification. His reluctance to discuss his past or his desires further complicated the situation, leaving me to navigate our interactions with a cautious sensitivity. I tried to create an environment where Graham felt safe to express himself, offering him space to explore his feelings and thoughts without judgment. This approach required patience and empathy, as I had to balance my own curiosity with Graham's evident need for privacy and control over his personal narrative. In doing so, I hoped to foster a sense of understanding and acceptance that could eventually bridge the gap between Graham's idealized vision of romance and the messy, multifaceted reality of human connection in the twenty-first century."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory.

"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled. Then again, whose upper management am I not describing? Who trusts their workplace? Who thinks their job is on the side of right?

I was naive, perhaps, but not entirely without defense. There were moments when my instincts screamed at me to act, to question, to save myself from the impending disaster. Yet, I hesitated, allowing doubt to paralyze me. I was young, inexperienced, and in the presence of someone who was a master manipulator. Adela played on my emotions, my desires for acceptance and admiration. She made me feel special, important, and in that intoxicating haze, I failed to see the trap I was stepping into. Now, as I stand here, the consequences of my folly laid bare, I am filled with a profound sense of regret. I wish I could turn back time, make different choices, but the past is immutable. All I can do now is learn from my mistakes, vow to be more vigilant, and hope that somewhere, somehow, I can make amends for the lives lost due to my inaction."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.","to achieve such a high score on the exam when he hadn't studied at all.

This revelation not only explained his surprising performance but also taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of strategic study habits over sheer volume of information memorization. From then on, I started to analyze the exam patterns more closely, applying Graham's method to improve my own study techniques."
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.","the fingers of one hand, his other hand holding a glass of whiskey.

""You're home early."" I nodded, setting my bag down and moving to stand behind him, looking out at the flickering flames. ""Work finished early,"" I replied, my voice softening as I took in the scene before me. The warmth of the room, the scent of tobacco and whiskey, and the sight of Graham in his usual spot, all combined to create a sense of comfort and familiarity. ""Would you like a drink?"" he asked, gesturing towards the bottle of whiskey on the table. ""I think I will,"" I said, taking a seat opposite him. As I sipped my drink, I watched him take a drag from his cigarette, the smoke curling upwards before dissipating into the room. It was a moment frozen in time, one that I cherished deeply. ""How was your day?"" he asked, breaking the comfortable silence that had settled between us. ""It was good,"" I said, truthfully. ""Yours?"" ""The same,"" he responded, his gaze drifting to the television screen, where a news report was playing. The room was filled with the hum of the television and the soft crackle of the fire, creating a cocoon of tranquility around us. It was in these moments, surrounded by the simple pleasures of life, that I felt most grateful for the companionship we shared. As the evening wore on, we talked and laughed, the worries of the day melting away in the warmth of our shared space. It was a testament to the strength of our bond, one that had weathered many storms and continued to flourish. In that cozy room, with the flickering light and the comforting presence of Graham, I felt a profound sense of peace and contentment."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers.

His passion for food bridged cultural gaps, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation among us for the rich tapestry of Southeast Asian flavors."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization.

I also reached out to contacts I had made during our bridge year to see if they could provide any insights or assistance in securing a position. As we prepared his application, I made sure to highlight his strengths and experiences from his naval career that could be advantageous in a new civilian role. I also took the initiative to learn more about the RAF's culture and values, preparing us for the possibility of becoming part of this community. Throughout this process, I remained his unwavering support, helping him navigate the complexities of transitioning from military to civilian life while ensuring that our relationship remained strong and our future together secure."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.","As the song played, the room filled with a nostalgic air, reminiscent of simpler times and the golden era of pop music.

The rest of the team, however, couldn't help but tap their feet or hum along, the infectious rhythm bringing a sense of camaraderie to the otherwise serious atmosphere of the meeting room. The choice of music, an eclectic mix of Motown and Beatles covers, seemed to reflect Graham's eclectic taste, a detail that went unnoticed until the Beatles track began to play. It was as if the playlist had a mind of its own, choosing songs that perfectly encapsulated the mood of the moment. The song's lyrics, ""You've really got a hold on me,"" seemed to echo the team's collective dedication to the project, each member feeling a strong commitment to seeing it through to success. The music, therefore, served not just as background noise but as a subtle motivator, subtly influencing the team's productivity and morale."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment.

"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets.

This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option. We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit. Still, we had not told them about the death camps.",output>,151,<output>

"Anne Spencer almost made it off those wards. After I read the email, an ancient and exuberant terror blazed through me.

The email had revealed a truth I had been desperately trying to ignore, a truth that had been lurking beneath the surface, waiting for the right moment to break free. It detailed a plan, a meticulously laid-out scheme that implicated not just me, but everyone I held dear. The names of those involved were listed, their roles outlined with chilling precision. Each name was a dagger to my heart, a reminder of the web of deceit I had woven, ensnaring not only myself but innocent people in my desperate bid for control. The plan was set to unfold in the coming days, a series of events that would lead to chaos, to destruction. And I, Anne Spencer, was at the very heart of it all. The weight of this revelation was crushing, suffocating. I had to act, but what could I do? The people involved were trusted allies, friends who had been manipulated, coerced, or simply deceived into participating. How could I possibly explain? How could I make them see the error of their ways, convince them to abandon the plan before it was too late? The fear was paralyzing, but I knew I had to try. I had to find a way to stop this madness before it consumed everything I held dear. The clock was ticking, and with each passing moment, the chances of averting disaster grew slimmer. I had to think, to plan, to act swiftly and decisively. The email had been a wake-up call, a harsh reminder that the path I had chosen was leading us all to ruin. I had to find a way out, a way to save those I had unwittingly betrayed. The journey ahead would be fraught with challenges, but I was determined to face them head-on. I couldn't let fear dictate my actions any longer. I had to be brave, to trust in the goodness of those I had misled, and to find the strength to make things right. The stakes had never been higher, and the weight of my decisions had never felt heavier. But deep down, I knew that there was still hope, a glimmer of light in the darkness. And I clung to that hope, determined to do whatever it took to turn things around."
"He was sitting at the noisome kitchen table, staring at nothing. Rogue Male was lying splayed and face down by the ashtray. The thing in my chest kicked again","as I realized he must have grabbed it as we left our home. When I came in, he didn’t move anything but his gaze, which swung up like a whip.","with a ferocity that left me gasping for air.

My hands trembled as I picked up the phone, my mind racing with the possibility of what I was about to do. The thought of confronting him, of finally standing up to the man who had haunted my every waking moment for far too long, was both terrifying and exhilarating. I dialed the number, each ring echoing in my ears like a drumbeat counting down to the inevitable confrontation. When he finally answered, his voice was calm, almost casual, as if he hadn't a care in the world. ""Hello?"" he said, his tone betraying no hint of recognition. ""It's me,"" I managed to say, my voice barely above a whisper. The silence that followed was deafening, a void filled with the weight of unspoken truths and the echoes of a past I could no longer ignore. ""What do you want?"" he finally asked, the coldness in his voice a stark contrast to the fire raging within me. ""I want you to know what you've done,"" I began, my words steady despite the turmoil inside. ""I want you to understand the destruction you've wrought, not just on me, but on everyone you've touched."" There was a pause, a moment that felt like an eternity, before he spoke again. ""And what do you propose?"" His question was a challenge, a gauntlet thrown down before me. I took a deep breath, summoning the courage to face the monster that had haunted my dreams. ""I want you to make it right,"" I said, my voice steady but firm. ""I want you to take responsibility for your actions, to face the consequences of your choices."" The line went dead, leaving me alone with my thoughts and the echo of my own determination. I knew the road ahead would be fraught with challenges, but I also knew that I could no longer live in the shadow of his tyranny. This was my chance to reclaim my life, to stand up for myself and for those who had suffered at his hands. And so, with a newfound sense of purpose, I prepared to embark on a journey that would test the limits of my resolve and force me to confront the darkest corners of my own soul."
