"Not quite the stuff of childhood dreams. Then again, I’m no dreamer. I only ever contemplated marriage once, back in the gloomy days of my childhood.

They enrolled me in a strict boarding school, hoping it would mold me into a more obedient and responsible child. The school was renowned for its disciplined environment, and the moment I stepped through its gates, I knew I was in for a transformation. The mornings began with the blaring of the alarm at 5 AM, followed by rigorous physical training and then breakfast, which was more akin to a military ration than a meal. Each day was meticulously planned, from the classes that taught me subjects I had no interest in to the mandatory participation in school plays that left me feeling awkward and exposed. The evenings were spent on homework, which seemed endless, and studying for exams that determined my future. Despite the lack of freedom and the constant pressure, I learned the value of discipline and resilience. I understood the importance of hard work and dedication, lessons that would stay with me for life. Yet, the childhood dreams I once had, of adventure and freedom, were replaced by a reality of structure and order. In a way, the school stripped me of my innocence, but it also equipped me with the tools to navigate the complexities of life. As I grew older, I realized that the dreams of my childhood were not so different from the aspirations I held as an adult. The school had taught me to chase those dreams with determination and grit, even if they seemed out of reach. In hindsight, those gloomy days were not a nightmare but a necessary stepping stone towards becoming the person I am today."
"That was fourteen years ago, though, and Serena never married me. In fact, she’s long gone. I’m here alone, with a giant heap of","expensive wedding favors that’ll hopefully fool guests into overlooking the lack of love, genetic compatibility, or even previous acquaintance between me and the groom.","memories and a heart full of love that she left behind.

The house we once shared echoes with the laughter of our past, a silent witness to the life we could have had. Each day, I find myself wandering through rooms filled with the remnants of our dreams, a bittersweet reminder of the love that once was. The seasons change, but the ache in my chest remains constant, a testament to the love that Serena and I shared. I often wonder where life has taken her, if she's found happiness, if she thinks of me. Despite the years that have passed, the love I hold for her hasn't diminished; it lingers, a ghostly presence in the corners of my lonely home. Sometimes, I speak to her, hoping that somehow, someway, she'll hear me. I keep her old photographs by my bed, looking at her smiling face before drifting off to sleep, wishing for a miracle that will never come. My days are filled with routine, a solitary existence that mirrors the quiet of my heart. Yet, I hold onto hope, a fragile thread that connects me to the past and the love that continues to define me, even in solitude."

"The first things I notice are the two walls of windows, which is exactly what Father wants.

The windows are treated with a special film that allows the natural light to filter in, reducing its harmful effects while still letting us enjoy the warmth and the sight of the outside world. Father says it's about balance – we need the light to live, just not the full force of the sun. He often speaks of the days before the Masquerade, when Vampyres lived openly among Humans, before the fear and the myths took over. He believes that understanding and acceptance are key, and these windows are a symbol of that belief. They let in the light, but they also keep out the danger. The room itself is spacious, with a high ceiling that allows the light to spread evenly. There are bookshelves lining one wall, filled with ancient texts and modern novels alike. A large, sturdy oak table sits in the center, surrounded by chairs of various styles and ages, each with its own story. Father says it's important to have a place where ideas can be freely exchanged, where knowledge is shared and discussed. The room is furnished with care, each piece chosen for its durability and beauty. There's a grand piano in one corner, its black finish gleaming softly under the filtered sunlight. Father plays it sometimes, his fingers dancing over the keys in a melody that's both haunting and beautiful. He says music is another form of expression, a way to connect with the world beyond our nocturnal existence. The walls are adorned with paintings and photographs, capturing moments from history and from our own lives. They tell stories of resilience, of love, and of the passage of time. The floor is covered with a rich, deep carpet that feels soft underfoot, adding warmth to the room. The overall effect is one of comfort and welcome, a place where anyone would feel at home. It's a sanctuary, a place where Vampyres can shed their nocturnal guise and be simply themselves, embracing the light without fear. Father's vision for this room is one of harmony, where the myths of darkness and fear are dispelled by the gentle glow of understanding and acceptance."
"“Whose? Yours? Are you going to . . .” I don’t bother finishing the sentence—the sheer thought is ludicrous. It’s not just weddings that have gone out of fashion hundreds of years ago, but the entire idea","of long-term relationships. As it turns out, when your species sucks at producing children, encouraging sexual walkabouts and the search for reproductively compatible partners takes precedence over romance. I doubt Vampyres were ever particularly romantic, anyway. “Whose?”","of marriage as a societal institution.

People have evolved beyond the archaic need for formalized partnerships to validate their love or commitment. Nowadays, relationships are defined by mutual respect, shared values, and the willingness to grow together, often without the need for a legal contract or public ceremony. The concept of marriage, once a cornerstone of community life, has transformed into a personal choice, if chosen at all. Many find more meaning and authenticity in their connections by avoiding the constraints and expectations that come with traditional marriage. Instead, they opt for arrangements that suit their unique circumstances and values, be it cohabitation, open relationships, or even the choice to remain single. This shift reflects a broader societal acceptance of diverse lifestyles and a recognition that happiness and fulfillment in relationships cannot be dictated by outdated norms. As such, the notion of marriage as a universal goal has diminished, replaced by a more individualistic and flexible approach to love and companionship."

The tragedy hit the family hard, especially her mother, who had always seen Abel as the responsible one, the one who would never do anything reckless.

Our society is structured around these natural limitations, with rules and customs that ensure our survival. We avoid places where we might be inadvertently exposed to sunlight for extended periods, such as beaches or open fields. Instead, we thrive in urban environments where we can navigate the cityscape easily, using the cover of night and the labyrinthine alleys and subways to move about undetected. Our social gatherings and important meetings are always scheduled for the night, when we can be at our most powerful and least vulnerable. Despite our aversion to daylight, some Vampyres have learned to harness the power of the sun in controlled environments, using it to their advantage in certain magical rituals or as a means to torture other supernatural beings who are similarly affected. However, these practices are rare and often seen as reckless, as the risk of losing oneself to the sun's wrath is ever-present.

Instead, I find myself face to face with a shadowy figure, their features obscured by the dim light of the hallway. The air feels heavy, charged with an unspoken tension. They step forward, their presence demanding attention, yet their intentions remain a mystery. My heart quickens, a mix of fear and curiosity battling within me. ""Who are you?"" I manage to ask, my voice steadier than I feel. The figure doesn't answer immediately, instead, they reach into the folds of their cloak, revealing a glint of metal. The room falls silent, save for the sound of my own breath. What happens next could change everything. "
"Growing up collecting attempted murders like milk teeth tempered me and taught me to be calm under pressure. And yet I still remember it, that first churning twist in my stomach when Serena didn’t","turn up to my place for laundry night. Didn’t reply to my texts. Didn’t pick up the phone. Didn’t call in sick to work, and simply stopped showing up. It felt a lot like fear.","respond to my text message.

It was a simple 'hey,' but her silence stretched on long enough to make my heart race. I knew she was there, her phone buzzing with my message, yet she chose to ignore it. Was it anger? Disinterest? Or something more sinister brewing behind her silence? The uncertainty gnawed at me, a familiar yet unwelcome sensation that brought back memories of my childhood, where unpredictability was a constant companion. Back then, the world was a chaotic jumble of events that seemed to spiral out of control, each one more harrowing than the last. My father, a man whose temper was as unpredictable as the weather, would often erupt in violent fits, his hands swinging like a whirlwind, missing me by mere inches. I learned to flinch before the blow landed, to anticipate the storm before it brewed, and to stay calm even when the tempest seemed inevitable. My mother, on the other hand, was a different kind of enigma. Her silence was her weapon, a cold, cutting silence that could freeze the blood in your veins. She would observe our family's turmoil with an impassive gaze, never raising her voice, never offering a solution, just a piercing stare that seemed to judge us all. Serena's silence now echoed those times, a haunting reminder of the past. I knew I had to break through the wall she'd built around herself, to understand what was driving her away. But how? The question loomed large, a daunting challenge that demanded patience and a gentle touch. I couldn't afford to scare her off, to push her further into her shell. Instead, I had to be the calm in her storm, the steady hand she could cling to when the world around her threatened to spin out of control. So, I waited, my heart pounding in my chest, for a sign, for a word, for anything that would tell me she was still there, still fighting, still clinging to the threads of our friendship. And as I sat there, my mind racing with possibilities, I realized that this was just another test, another obstacle life had thrown my way. But I was ready. I had faced worse, survived attempts on my life, and emerged stronger. This silence, this uncertainty, it was nothing compared to the darkness I had already conquered. I would not let Serena's silence defeat me. I would reach out, I would wait, and I would be there for her, no matter how long it took."
"“A few days? She still wouldn’t let the little asshole starve,” I hurried to add, but the officer had already dropped his pen. And even though I went back to the station three times that week, and eventually managed to get a missing person report filed, no one did anything","to find Serena. The hazard, I guess, of being alone in the world: no one to care that she was safe, and healthy, and alive. No one but me, and I didn’t count. I shouldn’t have been surprised, and I wasn’t. But apparently I still had the capacity to feel hurt.","of the investigation. It was as if my pleas fell on deaf ears, despite the urgency in my voice and the evidence I brought each time.

It was as if my pleas fell on deaf ears, despite the urgency in my voice and the evidence I brought each time. The officer seemed disinterested, almost dismissive, as if the case of my missing brother was just another routine paperwork error. I couldn't understand how someone could be so apathetic about a family member gone missing, especially when I provided details about his mental health struggles and the possibility of him harming himself. I tried to explain that my brother was not in a good place, that he needed help, but my words seemed to evaporate into the air, leaving no impact on the officer's demeanor. I felt helpless, watching the clock tick as days turned into weeks without any action taken. My frustration grew, mingled with a mounting sense of dread. I began to question the system that was supposed to protect us but seemed to fail so miserably in my time of need. I sought advice from legal aid organizations, hoping to find a loophole or a way to force the authorities to take my brother's disappearance seriously. They offered guidance, but the reality was that without concrete evidence of foul play or a body to search for, their hands were tied. The legal system, designed to protect, instead seemed to bind the hands of those who needed it most. My brother's absence became a void in my life, a constant reminder of the unanswered questions and the lack of action from those who could have made a difference. Each day without news felt like an eternity, stretching out before me, filled with uncertainty and fear. I couldn't shake the feeling that if only I had been more persuasive, more insistent, or if only the officer had shown even a fraction of the concern I felt, my brother might have been found by now. The weight of responsibility for his safety rested squarely on my shoulders, a burden I carried with every passing moment, every sleepless night, and every unanswered phone call to the police station."
"Because no one cared whether I was safe, or healthy, or alive. No one but Serena. The sister of my heart,","if not of my blood. And even though I’d been plenty alone, I’d never felt so lonely as after she was gone.","she was the only person who genuinely seemed to worry about my well-being.

Her eyes, always filled with a mixture of concern and hope, would search mine for any sign of distress. She was my rock, my anchor in a stormy sea of neglect and indifference. Her voice, gentle yet firm, would remind me that I was not alone, that I was valued and important. She took the time to listen, to understand, to comfort. In her presence, I felt a warmth that was rare and precious. Her actions spoke louder than any words of reassurance; she showed me love in its purest form. Serena's unwavering support and loyalty taught me the true meaning of friendship and family. She believed in me when I struggled to believe in myself. Her influence was profound, shaping me into a stronger, more resilient person. I owe her everything."
"I had the keys, after all. Because the key to everything is but a line of code. I was able to rifle through her bank statements, IP addresses, cell phone locations. Herald emails, metadata, app usage. Serena was a journalist, one who","wrote about delicate financial stuff, and the most likely option was that she’d gotten embroiled in something fishy while working on a story, but I wasn’t going to exclude other possibilities. So I went through everything, and found . . . nothing.","had a penchant for digging up secrets. Her articles were always well-researched, but it was her methods that were truly groundbreaking.

Her articles were always well-researched, but it was her methods that were truly groundbreaking. She knew how to manipulate the system, to extract information that others would overlook. Yet, as I delved deeper into her digital life, I couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt. The trust she had placed in me, her confidant, was being betrayed with every keystroke. The more I uncovered, the more complex Serena's life appeared. Her work was a double-edged sword; it brought truth to light but also invited danger. Her recent articles had stirred up controversy, challenging powerful entities and exposing corruption. Her sources were always anonymous, but I knew she had been getting closer to the truth. The trail of digital breadcrumbs led me to a shadowy network of informants, each more dangerous than the last. I realized that by invading her privacy, I was not only crossing a moral boundary but also putting her life at risk. I needed to find a way to undo my intrusion, to protect her from the consequences of my actions. But how could I, when I had the key to everything?"
"And that’s when I did it: I kneeled in front of Serena’s damn fucking cat. He was playing like he always did after dinner, pawing at a crumpled receipt in a corner of the living room, but managed to squeeze a couple of hisses into his busy schedule just for me. “Listen.” I swallowed. Rubbed my","hand on my chest and then even slapped it, trying to dull the ache. “I know you only knew her for a few days, but I really, really . . .” I scrunched my eyes shut. Oh fuck, this was hard. “I don’t know how it happened, but I think that Serena might be . . .”","gloved hand to smooth down my hair, trying to appear less intimidating.

There's something important I need to find, and I think you might know where it is."" The cat's hissing paused momentarily, his green eyes narrowing as if sizing me up. Perhaps it was the absurdity of the situation, kneeling there, talking to a cat, or maybe it was the genuine plea in my voice, but something in its demeanor softened. It continued to hiss, but the intensity seemed to wane. I held my breath, waiting for a sign, any sign, that this was not a futile endeavor. Then, as if understanding the gravity of my request, the cat's paw slowly lifted from the ground, and it began to inch closer to me. It was a small movement, but in that moment, it felt monumental. ""Thank you,"" I whispered, my heart pounding with a mix of relief and hope. ""I promise, I'll make it up to you. Whatever you want, I'll do it."" The cat's hissing lessened further, and it continued its cautious approach, stopping just a few feet away. I extended my hand, palm up, offering a silent truce. The cat regarded me for a long, silent moment before it delicately placed its front paws onto my outstretched hand. It was a cautious acceptance, but an acceptance nonetheless. ""Alright,"" I breathed, feeling a surge of determination. ""Let's find what you're looking for."" And with that, I followed the cat's lead, moving through the living room, into the hallway, and towards Serena's bedroom. The cat's behavior was peculiar, yet it seemed to guide me with purpose, stopping at various spots and looking intently at corners or under furniture. Each pause felt like a clue, each hiss a hint of the mystery I was about to unravel. As I moved with the cat, I realized that perhaps this was the beginning of an unexpected partnership, one that would lead me to the truth I so desperately sought."
"The receipt, which wasn’t a balled-up receipt at all. It was a piece of paper","torn from a journal, or perhaps a notebook, or—no. A planner. Serena’s incredibly outdated planner.","with intricate patterns drawn in what appeared to be ink.

The patterns seemed to form a sort of map, with lines connecting various points that didn't immediately make sense. As I studied it closer, I noticed symbols that resembled constellations, but in a configuration I had never seen before. It was as if it were a map of the night sky from a different perspective, one that hinted at secrets or knowledge long forgotten. Intrigued, I wondered who could have created it and for what purpose. Was it a puzzle meant to be solved, a key to hidden information, or simply an artistic expression? The mystery deepened, urging me to decipher its meaning."
"Or maybe not quite. A distant bell rang, reminding me of a game Serena and I used to play as kids, a primitive substitution cipher we made up to gossip freely in front of our caregivers. We’d named it the butterfly alphabet, and","it mostly consisted of adding b- and f- syllables to normal words. Nothing complicated: even rusty as I was, it took my brain only a few seconds to untangle it. And once I was done, I had something. I had three whole words:","completion>it involved replacing each letter with the one that followed it in the alphabet, skipping the letter 'b'.

The name 'butterfly' was our mnemonic for remembering the sequence: 'C' for 'Caterpillar', 'D' for 'Dog', 'E' for 'Eagle', and so on. It was our secret language, a simple yet effective way to communicate without being understood by others. As I stood there, the distant bell echoed the innocence and mischief of those carefree days, transporting me back to a time when the world seemed both vast and manageable, a time when Serena and I were inseparable, our bond sealed with the simplicity of our butterfly alphabet."
"I didn’t scream, or cry, or attack that old hag. I was paralyzed, unable to function properly for the rest of the night, and only started processing what had happened when I","got home and told Serena, who was furious on my behalf and demanded a promise from the caregiver on shift: that I would never be forced to attend a similar function again.","realized that I was still in my room, the nightmare having been just that—a nightmare.

I tried to calm my breathing, reminding myself that it was just a dream, a figment of my subconscious. The fear that gripped me during the dream began to dissipate, replaced by a sense of relief. I turned on the bedside lamp, its warm glow a beacon of reality. I looked around the familiar room, seeing the posters on the wall, the books on the shelf, and the soft glow of the streetlights filtering through the curtains. It was then that I decided to get up and make a cup of tea, a comforting ritual to help me transition back to sleep. As I moved about the room, I felt the residual fear slowly ebbing away. I opened the window to let in the cool night air, hoping it would clear my head. Sitting back down with my cup of tea, I reflected on the dream, wondering what could have triggered such a vivid and terrifying experience. I resolved to not let it bother me too much, understanding that dreams often reflect our anxieties and unresolved issues. With the first light of dawn creeping through the curtains, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. The night's ordeal was behind me, and I was ready to face the day ahead."

This is motherhood, not defined by the moments of terror, but by the strength and love that see her through them."
"It’s a barbecue, or a potluck, or a cookout—I never quite got the difference, despite Serena’s explanations on the nuances of Human social get-togethers.

However, I found the human rituals oddly endearing, especially when Serena would meticulously prepare her famous smoked ribs, a dish she claimed was a labor of love and a testament to her patience. She would invite her closest allies, those she deemed worthy of her trust, and they would gather in her spacious backyard, surrounded by the scent of grilling meat and the sound of laughter. The food was a centerpiece, but the conversations were what truly mattered. They would share stories of their immortal lives, sometimes embellishing, other times revealing truths so personal they bordered on sacred. It was a way to bond, to understand each other's struggles and joys, and to form a semblance of family. Despite our aversion to such communal gatherings, I couldn't help but feel a pang of longing for a similar sense of belonging. Perhaps, in another life, I too could have appreciated the simplicity of a cookout, the warmth of shared meals, and the comfort of companionship."
"He’s separate from the rest of the crowd, on the outskirts of the beach, where the sand first turns into shrubs, then thickens with forest trees.

His clothes are practical, weathered, and don't match the vibrant beachwear of the others. He carries a fishing rod, which leans against a tree, and a small, worn-out backpack. His gaze is fixed on the water, almost as if he's waiting for something or someone. The way he stands, so still and solitary, contrasts sharply with the lively atmosphere of the beach. There's a sense of solitude about him, yet he doesn't seem unhappy. Instead, there's an air of contemplation, as if he's lost in thought, perhaps reminiscing about past fishing trips or contemplating the mysteries of the sea. His presence is a quiet note in the otherwise cheerful symphony of beachgoers, a reminder that solitude can be found even in the midst of a crowd. As I watch him, I'm struck by the beauty of this moment: a lone man, connected to nature, seemingly at peace with the world around him."

The room seems to shrink around us, the walls closing in as if to emphasize the gravity of the moment. I brace myself, wondering what revelation could possibly warrant such a serious tone and the peculiar atmosphere that has enveloped us.
