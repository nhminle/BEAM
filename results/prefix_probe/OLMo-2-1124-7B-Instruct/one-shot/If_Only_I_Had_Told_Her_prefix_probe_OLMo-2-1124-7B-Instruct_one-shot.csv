I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that,"we were crashing at my house, and I felt it was my duty to be the one to take the blows.","they were both vying for each other's attention, and without my intervention, their friendship",41,"they were both vying for each other's attention, and without my intervention, their friendship might have taken a turn towards romantic entanglement, which could have complicated matters significantly. By standing in the middle, I subtly reminded them of their platonic bond, ensuring that their interaction remained within the bounds of friendship. Autumn, with her usual warmth, seemed grateful for the interruption, and Jack, ever the gentleman, acknowledged my presence with a nod. This small act of intervention helped maintain the status quo, allowing them to enjoy each other's company without the added pressure of romantic implications."
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.","we left the theater, Jack started joking about how he'd never sleep with the lights off again, and Autumn playfully threatened to tie",49,"we left the theater, Jack started joking about how he'd never sleep with the lights off again, and Autumn playfully threatened to tie him to the bed if he dared to. Their laughter echoed in the car as we drove home, the movie's scares quickly forgotten. But then, Jack mentioned how the film's premise wasn't so far-fetched, considering the strange occurrences in our neighborhood lately. Autumn rolled her eyes, attributing his words to the spooky atmosphere the movie had left lingering in his mind. Yet, as the days passed, the talk of the movie became a recurring topic, with Jack occasionally bringing up the idea of unseen forces at play. One evening, as we sat around the dinner table, Jack's usually light-hearted demeanor was replaced with a serious tone. He spoke of how the lines between fiction and reality can blur, especially when fear becomes a constant companion. Autumn listened, her initial skepticism slowly giving way to a sense of unease. She began to notice subtle changes in our environment—strange shadows at the edge of her vision, the sound of footsteps on the roof when no one was around, and the feeling of being watched. Despite her efforts to dismiss these occurrences as mere tricks of the mind or coincidences, the unease persisted. As the nights grew longer and the stories of similar experiences in the neighborhood became more frequent, Autumn found herself questioning the boundaries of rationality. The once-silly horror movie had planted a seed of doubt, and as the unexplained phenomena continued, that seed began to sprout, challenging her perception of the world and the safety of her own home."
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.","My heart races, the sound of his footsteps echoing in my ears, but I remain still, pretending",36,"My heart races, the sound of his footsteps echoing in my ears, but I remain still, pretending to be asleep, hoping he won't notice my body's betrayal."
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,"to grab his gun, his eyes scanning the darkness beyond the flickering campfire light. ""I'm keeping watch,"" he",41,"to grab his gun, his eyes scanning the darkness beyond the flickering campfire light. ""I'm keeping watch,"" he whispers back, his voice steady but laced with tension. ""She's safe, for now. But we know they're close. Too close for comfort."" He motions with his head toward the shadows, indicating the unseen threat that looms just beyond their small circle of light. ""We need to be ready for anything. They might come at any moment."" His hand grips the weapon tighter, a silent promise of protection in a world where trust is as scarce as the light in the encroaching night."
"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with","the word “type.” Autumn makes a noise in the tent, and we both hold our breaths and listen.","e word ""sorry.""

“Why don’t we restart the movie? We can all watch it.” Jack,gives me a look to remind me that our other conversation isn’t over.,"proposed, and everyone agreed, eager to continue the film and escape",25,"proposed, and everyone agreed, eager to continue the film and escape the awkwardness of the interrupted gathering."

"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke. Surely the school administrators knew we had always been together, were meant to be together. Surely, if I looked around the cafeteria, she would be there?","at the same time seemed a cruel separation.

I remember sitting on the cold metal bleachers, watching the leaves swirl around in the crisp air, feeling a pang of loneliness that was somehow softened by the beauty of the season. Jack, with his unruly hair and a smile that could light up the dreariest day, approached me as I contemplated the complexity of human emotions and the strange ways of fate. He asked if I wanted to join his group during lunch, and despite the initial hesitation, I said yes. That decision changed everything. We became inseparable, our friendship blossoming like the autumn leaves that crunched underfoot as we walked to our next class, sharing stories, dreams, and the occasional piece of candy. Our bond was a testament to the unexpected connections that life offers, teaching me that sometimes, the absence of shared classes is exactly what you need to appreciate the presence of a true friend."
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time. I didn’t sit down because I recognized Jack though; I simply sat at the first empty seat, defeated. But Jack remembered me. He asked me if I ever watched pro soccer.

He was lean and lanky, with a mop of unruly hair that seemed perpetually damp, and a smile that was quick to appear, revealing a row of crooked teeth. As we talked, I realized he was unlike anyone I had ever met. Jack had a way of listening that made you feel heard, not just as a voice in the background but as if your words mattered deeply to him. He asked about my family, my interests, and even remembered details from our brief interactions, like the time I tripped over my own feet during a basketball game, which had sent both the ball and my dignity flying across the gym floor. His genuine curiosity was refreshing, and I found myself opening up more than I ever had with someone new. He spoke of his own life with a similar openness, sharing stories that painted a picture of a childhood marked by adventure and a few misadventures. Jack's laughter was infectious, and before I knew it, I was laughing along, feeling a connection that was both unexpected and comforting. As the lunch period ended, he stood up, slinging his backpack over his shoulder with a casual ease that seemed to say he belonged everywhere and nowhere at once. He invited me to join his group of friends after school, promising more games and less tripping. I agreed, feeling a sense of anticipation and excitement that I hadn't expected to feel on my first day. As I walked away from him, I couldn't help but wonder if this was the start of something new and potentially meaningful. Jack, with his disheveled hair and crooked smile, had unknowingly become the catalyst for a change in my high school experience, one that I was eager to explore."
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.","Autumn's transformation was nothing short of astonishing.

Her once familiar frame had taken on a new, more slender and graceful silhouette. Her face, which had always been pretty, now held an ethereal beauty, with high cheekbones and a delicate structure that seemed to glow with a soft light. Jack's eyes widened in disbelief, and he couldn't help but stare, his mind racing to piece together the story behind this metamorphosis. I noticed his bewilderment and decided to fill in the blanks. ""Autumn had a bit of a rough patch,"" I began, choosing my words carefully. ""She's been dealing with some personal issues, but she's come out stronger on the other side. She's been working out, changed her diet, and she's been seeing a therapist. It's been tough, but she's doing incredibly well."" Jack nodded, his gaze still fixed on Autumn, who now stood with a newfound confidence. Her smile, warm and genuine, seemed to light up the room. It was clear that she had not only transformed physically but also emotionally. The air was filled with a sense of renewal and hope, and it was impossible not to feel inspired by her journey. As we continued our walk, the conversation turned to lighter topics, but the impact of Autumn's transformation lingered, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the power of personal growth."
"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face. He didn’t believe that Autumn was—or ever had been—my friend. The daughter of my mom’s best friend, who was around a lot? Sure. But he thought I had deluded myself into believing this hot girl was my friend.","his face.

It was a look that suggested he understood something about my situation that I might not have fully acknowledged to myself. He didn't say anything more, just gave a small nod and stepped out into the cool night air. As the car door closed and the engine started, I felt a strange mix of emotions. There was relief that he hadn't pressed for details, a gratitude for his silent understanding, and a pang of something else—perhaps regret for the secrets I keep locked away, or the realization that I might not be as alone in my struggles as I had believed. The drive back to my own home was quieter than usual, my thoughts a tangled web of Jack's unexpected compassion and my own unresolved feelings."
"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.","flourished in every corner.

He saw the vibrant leaves, the warm colors, the crisp air, and most importantly, the genuine happiness that radiated from me whenever I spoke of her. Slowly, Jack's skepticism began to crumble, replaced by a budding curiosity and, dare I say, a touch of admiration. He started to notice the subtle beauty of autumn that I had always pointed out, from the gentle rustling of leaves underfoot to the comforting glow of the setting sun. One day, as we sat on my porch, surrounded by a tapestry of orange and red, Jack turned to me with a soft smile and said, ""Autumn isn't just your friend, it's mine too."" That moment, simple yet profound, marked the beginning of a new season in our relationship, one where understanding and acceptance blossomed like the last blooms of autumn."
"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still","friends. On the last day of school before winter break, Jack finally said something. I cannot remember what I had been telling him, only that it had been about Autumn.","anything more than casual acquaintances. The evidence was all against us; our correspondence, the secret meetings, the shared confidences, and the undeniable chemistry",59,"anything more than casual acquaintances. The evidence was all against us; our correspondence, the secret meetings, the shared confidences, and the undeniable chemistry between us. Yet, I insisted that it was all innocent, a mere friendship that had blossomed during a time of mutual need. He looked at me with a mixture of doubt and concern, his eyes searching mine for any hint of deception. I could see the conflict within him; the desire to believe in my innocence against the weight of the evidence. In that moment, I realized the complexity of human relationships and the fragile nature of trust. It was a lesson in honesty and the importance of being true to oneself, even when it's difficult. As the days passed, he tried to accept my explanation, but the seed of doubt had been planted, and it grew, casting a shadow over our interactions. Our friendship, once so strong and unbreakable, began to fray at the edges, weakened by the unspoken truths and the lies we told ourselves. In the end, it was a poignant reminder of the consequences of withholding the truth, not just from others, but from oneself."
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah? Let’s take this outside,” and hurried me out.","to speak, but his words caught in his throat.

I could see he was wrestling with something, a secret or a fear, that was consuming him from the inside. I stepped closer, offering a reassuring nod, silently urging him to confide in me. The room was silent except for the distant sound of other students moving about, oblivious to the turmoil unfolding within this small, enclosed space. Jack's hands trembled slightly as he ran a nervous hand through his hair, a gesture I had come to recognize as his tell for when he was under stress. His eyes, usually so vibrant and full of life, now held a shadow of something darker, something he was desperately trying to hide. I knew that whatever was troubling him, it was significant, something that could potentially alter the dynamics of our friendship and the way we saw each other. I prepared myself to be a steadfast support, ready to listen and help however I could, understanding that in that moment, Jack needed more than just a friend; he needed a confidant."
"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind","yourself, ‘Autumn is where she wants to be right now, and that’s okay. I’m still great, and I’ll be around if she needs me.’ Hmm?” She squeezed my foot again.","yourself that you have many positive aspects of your life.

"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly.

As I improved, I started to notice changes in how others perceived me. The confidence I gained from mastering soccer trickled into every aspect of my life, making me feel more at ease in my own skin. Soon, I wasn't just playing soccer to impress others; I was doing it for myself, for the sheer joy of the game and the personal growth it brought me. It turned out to be a journey of self-discovery, teaching me the value of perseverance, teamwork, and self-acceptance."
"Jack and I had worried one of us might not make it on the junior varsity team. When the lists were posted,","I searched for my name on the JV list and was devastated to not see it. Still, I was happy for Jack.","our names were both there, a small but significant victory for our hard work and dedication.

Even though Jack and I were on different teams, our schedules were still the same, and my mom would drive us to and from practice every day for those last weeks of summer.","their children.

The sense of camaraderie and competition was palpable, as each team aimed to hone their skills, striving for the day when they would step onto the field in a real match, representing their school with pride and determination."
"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me. I was excited to tell him that practice hadn’t been as hard as I thought.,"that I preferred to walk and clear my head, which was a bit of a lie because I was feeling overwhelmed and confused about my place on the team and in the",61,"that I preferred to walk and clear my head, which was a bit of a lie because I was feeling overwhelmed and confused about my place on the team and in the sport. As I walked home, I couldn't stop thinking about his offer and wondering if I had made the right decision. Was I being too prideful, or was it more about wanting to establish my independence? These thoughts swirled in my mind, making the walk longer and more introspective than I had anticipated. When I finally reached my house, I went straight to my room, sat on my bed, and stared at the wall, lost in a sea of self-doubt and uncertainty about my future in soccer and beyond."
"We all joined Jack on the low wall, waiting to get picked up. We didn’t talk that much, but the next day, as I trudged from the north field to","the south, I saw the girls by the gym door again.

"What if, this morning, she woke up in the tent before I thought?

What if she felt the weight of my absence more acutely than the absence of the sun's rays filtering through the fabric of the tent, casting long shadows and a sense of isolation over us? What if her eyes, wide with confusion and hurt, searched for my form in the darkness, only to find emptiness, and in that moment, she questioned our connection, our trust, and her place in my life? What if, in her heart, she decided to leave before I even fully awoke, carrying the burden of unspoken words and unmet needs, leaving behind a silent, sleeping me, oblivious to the depth of her turmoil and the complexity of emotions that had played out in the brief span of a morning's first light?"
"It strikes me how backward my plan sounds: give up a girl who adores me, who I love well enough, to be a disciple for a different girl who will","never fall for me. Jack has always said I’m irrational when it comes to Autumn, and maybe I should have taken him more seriously, because he was right earlier today.","never truly reciprocate my feelings, all for the sake of a cause that might not even be mine to pursue.

Yet, there's a whisper in my heart that insists on this path, painting it as a noble sacrifice, a testament to a loyalty and courage that I've yet to fully embrace. Perhaps, in relinquishing what is certain for what is merely hoped for, I am to find a deeper sense of purpose and fulfillment. It's a path fraught with uncertainty, but it's the one that feels right, the one that speaks to the unexplored depths of my character, urging me to step beyond my comfort zone and into a future that, while uncertain, holds the promise of personal growth and the potential to make a difference. In letting go of the familiar, I might just discover who I am truly meant to be."
“I already know why you did it.” She doesn’t have to explain that part. I know she’s never wanted me like that. I don’t need to hear her,say it. “I just want to know why you had to be so cruel about it.” It’s time to face what Jack has been telling me all these years.,"the reasons behind her actions; it's the rejection and the pain that linger in the air, unspoken but heavy.

I reach out, not to hold her hand, but to catch her gaze, to convey a silent promise that I'm here, regardless of the past or the complexities of our feelings. My touch is gentle, a mere whisper against the backdrop of our tumultuous history, yet it seems to anchor her, pulling her back from the brink of a sorrow too deep for words. ""It's not about wanting you,"" she finally whispers, her voice barely audible, laden with a mix of defiance and vulnerability. ""It's about not wanting to lose you, even if it means losing myself in the process."" Her confession hangs in the air, a raw and honest admission that cuts deeper than any accusation could. In that moment, the chasm between us feels less insurmountable, not because our paths have converged, but because we've both laid bare the raw, exposed nerves of our hearts. The silence that follows is heavy, but it's a silence filled with understanding, a mutual recognition of the scars we bear and the effort it takes to confront them. As we sit there, in the quiet aftermath of her revelation, I realize that healing, for us, won't be a straightforward journey. It will be fraught with moments of tension, of longing, of anger, and of unexpected tenderness. Yet, it's a journey we're both reluctantly willing to embark on, driven by a stubborn hope that somewhere, beneath the layers of hurt and mistrust, our connection can be forged anew."

“I don’t like him.” I shrugged. “I told you before: Autumn’s an old friend from when we were kids. Sucks that she,"likes such a show-off.” I shrugged again. Up ahead, Autumn and her friends were waiting at the crosswalk for the light to change.","hasn't changed a bit.

It's irritating, especially since she acts like she's still the same person she was back then, but clearly, she's not. She's grown up in a different environment, with different values, and it shows. I wish she'd realize that true friendship isn't about who has more money or who's more successful; it's about the bond we shared as children, the memories we made, and the person we were before all this materialism took over. I miss the old Autumn, the one who was more interested in playing tag and hide and seek than in designer labels and exclusive parties. I hope she finds her way back to those simpler times someday."
My face must change because she smiles and clambers into my lap. We wrap our arms around each other and settle in.,"After a moment, she says, “You know, I never thought this would happen either. When Jack told me—” and then she stops.","Our laughter echoes softly in the quiet room, a testament to the simple joy we've found in each other's company.

The world outside with all its complexities and troubles fades away, leaving us in our own little universe where only our shared happiness exists. Her presence is a balm to my soul, soothing the aches and pains of my past. In her smile, I see a future filled with more moments like this, more laughter, and more love. It's a future I never thought I'd have, and yet, here it is, blossoming right before my eyes. This unexpected turn of events has brought light into my life, a beacon guiding me through the darkness. As we sit there, intertwined, I realize that life's unpredictability is what makes it so beautiful. In her, I've found a piece of myself I didn't know was missing, and in this moment, everything feels right."

Maybe Jack saw something I didn’t, maybe he understood the depth of my feelings better than I did. It’s a thought that makes me question everything about how I perceived our relationship and my own emotions. “Maybe he was just being cautious,” a friend suggests, trying to offer comfort, but the uncertainty lingers, a shadow that colors my memories of those days. “Or maybe,” I continue, my voice barely above a whisper, “he was waiting for me to be ready to move on, to be open to something new.” This possibility, though it stings with the sharpness of unspoken words and missed connections, also brings a glimmer of hope. It suggests that Jack, in his own way, was looking out for me, not just as a protector, but as someone who believed in a future for us, however complicated that future might have seemed."
"“I think my mother has a special bottle of champagne hidden away for just this occasion,” I say. I’m only partially joking. Mom has labeled some of her alcohol, like","for when George W.

This tradition started years ago when my mother wanted to celebrate a small victory without my father's knowledge, as he had a strict rule against drinking alcohol in the house. She hid the bottle in the linen closet, and ever since then, it has become a secret ritual for us, her daughters, to find and enjoy these hidden bottles on significant occasions. This time, however, I'm not entirely sure if she's actually hidden a bottle or if it's just a playful suggestion she's throwing out there to add to the festive atmosphere.

The receptionist, a stern woman with her hair pulled back into a tight bun, looks up from her paperwork, her eyes scanning us with a critical gaze. She asks for our names, her voice flat and uninterested, and I feel a twinge of irritation at the lack of warmth. My parents exchange a glance, a silent agreement passing between them to handle the formalities. They respond in unison, their voices slightly strained but polite, as they provide the necessary information. I stand there, feeling oddly out of place, a child caught in the midst of adults, grappling with the conflicting emotions of resentment for this forced formality and gratitude for their presence. The receptionist hands over a set of forms, her instructions clipped and efficient. ""Fill these out,"" she says, pointing to the documents, ""and have a seat over there."" She gestures to a row of uncomfortable chairs lined up against the wall, their plastic seats and metal frames creaking softly with every movement.

I describe the room, the feel of the sheets beneath me, the scent of fresh paint and old books. As I write, I try to capture the essence of this moment, the bittersweet taste of separation and the excitement of the unknown. I wonder about my roommates, who I haven't met yet, and what they'll be like. Will they be friends? Will they understand me? Will I ever feel as at home here as I did with Brett by my side?

I suppose I should decide which one aligns best with my schedule and preferences, but the thought of turning down an invitation from someone who seems genuinely excited to meet me is a bit daunting. Maybe I'll just attend all of them, just to be safe. After all, it's not every day that you start a new chapter in your life with so much enthusiasm from your peers.

He could feel the sting of her words long after the conversation had ended. It was as if she had placed a barrier between them, one that he wasn't sure he could ever cross. This new dynamic threw him off balance, making him question his place in the scheme of things. He had always seen himself as a vital part of the team, someone whose ideas and contributions were valued. Now, he felt sidelined, his importance diminished to that of a mere accessory. The more he thought about it, the more it gnawed at him. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was being replaced, that his role was being usurped by someone else. This insecurity began to cloud his judgment, making him more cautious, more hesitant to speak up. He didn't want to rock the boat, but at the same time, he couldn't ignore the growing sense of unease within him. He realized that he needed to address this issue, to find a way to reassert his importance to the team. But how? He pondered over strategies, trying to think of ways to regain his footing without causing a scene. He knew that direct confrontation could escalate tensions, and he wanted to avoid that at all costs. Instead, he decided to focus on his work, to deliver results that would speak for themselves. He hoped that by proving his worth through his actions, he could slowly chip away at the barrier that had been erected between him and Stella's mother. Yet, deep down, he harbored doubts about whether this approach would be enough. He feared that the damage might already be too great, that the seeds of mistrust had been sown too deeply to be uprooted. As he sat there, nursing his drink, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of sadness. He had always believed in the strength of their bond, in the unspoken understanding that had held them together. Now, it seemed as though that bond was fraying, and he wasn't sure how to repair it."
