"Aside from Eager Beaver, there are fourteen of us starting today. Fourteen of us fresh out of top-five graduate programs, and prestigious internships, and CV-beefing industry","jobs accepted exclusively to look more attractive during NASA’s next round of recruitment. There’re fourteen of us, and the thirteen that aren’t me are all nodding enthusiastically.",53,"programs, and CV-beefing experiences. We're a diverse bunch, each bringing unique skills and perspectives to the table. Our team leader, a former tech startup CEO, has high expectations and a clear vision for what we'll achieve this summer. We're all excited about the opportunity to collaborate, learn, and grow professionally under such a dynamic mentorship. The project we're about to embark on involves cutting-edge research in renewable energy technologies, and we're eager to make a significant impact. Our first day was filled with introductions, brainstorming sessions, and a deep dive into the project's objectives. We're all aware that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to prove ourselves and build a strong professional network. The camaraderie among us is already strong, and we're confident that together, we'll exceed our goals and make our mark in the industry."
"The truth, though, is quite the opposite. I hated school at first sight—with the direct consequence that school hated the sullen, listless child that I was right back. In the first grade, I refused to learn how to write my name, even though Hannah is only three letters repeated twice. In junior high, I set a school record for the highest number of consecutive detention days—what happens when","you decide to take a stand and not do homework for any of your classes because they are too boring, too difficult, too useless, or all of the above. Until the end of my sophomore year, I couldn’t wait to graduate and leave all of school behind: the books, the teachers, the grades, the cliques. Everything. I didn’t really have a plan for after, except for leaving now behind.",137,"my refusal to do homework led to a series of confrontations with teachers who were at their wit's end trying to motivate me. My parents, concerned but initially unaware of the depth of my disengagement, tried various methods to encourage my academic participation, from rewarding good behavior to imposing strict consequences for non-compliance. Nothing seemed to work, and my academic performance suffered accordingly. It wasn't until my eighth-grade year that a teacher, Mrs. Thompson, recognized the signs of a deeper issue. She suggested that I might be experiencing a form of learning disability, which could explain my struggles with reading and writing. This was a revelation; it was the first time anyone had proposed that my difficulties were not a result of laziness or defiance but a neurological difference. This realization led to a series of evaluations that confirmed Mrs. Thompson's suspicions, and I was subsequently placed in a specialized program designed to address dyslexia. The shift was transformative. Suddenly, the tools and techniques that had eluded me were within reach. I learned to read fluently for the first time, and my confidence soared. School, which had been a source of constant frustration and shame, became a place of learning and achievement. The journey from disengagement to diagnosis and ultimately to success was long and fraught, but it taught me invaluable lessons about perseverance, self-advocacy, and the importance of understanding one's unique needs. Today, I am a strong advocate for early identification and support for students with learning differences, sharing my story to inspire others who may be struggling in silence."
"“It’s like space is your whole personality,” the girl I casually hooked up with during most of my sophomore year of undergrad told me. It was after I explained that no, thank you, I wasn’t interested in going out for coffee to meet her friends because of a lecture on","Kalpana Chawla I was planning to attend. “Do you have any other interests?” she asked. I threw her a quick “Nope,” waved good-bye, and wasn’t too surprised when, the following week, she didn’t reply to my offer to meet up. After all, I clearly couldn’t give her what she wanted.",100,
"“Yeah, I’m not sure.” She shrugs and continues to make her way through a Tupperware of broccoli, an apple, and approximately two fucktons of Cheez-Its. “I don’t really know much about him. His parents divorced, then people in my family had arguments and stopped talking to each other. There was a lot of","prime Floyd dysfunction happening, so I haven’t actually spoken to him in years. But I heard from one of my other cousins that he was working on that thing that landed on Mars back when we were in high school. It was called something like . . . Contingency, or Carpentry, or Crudity—”",106,"chaos and drama. I guess I never really paid attention to his side of the family. I mean, I saw him around occasionally, but we never really spoke or hung out. He seemed to keep to himself a lot, and I was always so caught up in my own life that I never really tried to get to know him better. Now that I think about it, I feel kind of bad. Maybe I could've been a better sister or friend to him. I don't know what he's been through or how he's been coping with everything. It's a lot to take in, and I wish I could go back and change things. I just hope he's okay and that he finds some peace and happiness in his life."
"“I think so. Do the dates add up? Maybe it was some kind of summer internship? But honestly, it might just be Floyd family lore. I have an aunt who insists that we’re related to","the Finnish royals, and according to Wikipedia there are no Finnish royals. So.” She shrugs and pops another handful of Cheez-Its in her mouth. “Would you like me to ask around, though? For the assignment?”",70,"some famous person from the past, like a distant cousin of George Washington or something. She has this old family tree that connects us to all sorts of notable figures, though I've never seen any real evidence to back it up. It's possible that this internship story is just another one of those family legends that gets passed down through generations, embellished with details each time it's told. Maybe it started as a simple summer job that someone exaggerated over time to make it sound more interesting or prestigious. Without concrete evidence, like a letter of recommendation or some sort of documentation, it's hard to take such claims seriously. It's not uncommon for families to have these kinds of stories, and often they remain just that - stories, rather than factual history."
"“By the way, I sent you my cousin-or-something’s contact info a while ago,” Mara tells me one night. We’re at the",cheapest grad bar we’ve been able to find. She’s on her second Midori sour of the night. “Did you get it?”,42,"local diner, sitting across from each other in our usual booth. ""Did you get it?"" she asks, her tone casual but her eyes betraying a hint of impatience. I nod, fishing out my phone from my pocket, the screen lighting up with the familiar name and number. ""I did,"" I confirm, a sense of responsibility washing over me. ""Have you tried reaching out?"" she queries, biting into her burger. ""Not yet,"" I admit, ""I've been meaning to, but things have been hectic."" Her expression softens, understanding the chaos of life. ""Well, give her a call soon,"" she urges, a note of genuine concern in her voice. ""She's been looking forward to it."" The conversation shifts to lighter topics, but the reminder lingers, a subtle nudge to fulfill my promise. Later that night, as I lay in bed, the weight of Mara's words settles in, propelling me to finally make the call. It's a small gesture, but one that connects us to the people who matter, bridging the gap of distance and time."
"He frowns, as if momentarily blanking on Mara’s name. “Ah, yes.” He nods. Only once. “Apparently,” he adds, which makes me laugh. He waits for me to take a seat","across from him before folding back in his chair. I notice that he doesn’t hold out his hand, nor does he smile. Interesting. “Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.”",61,"before continuing, “she’s been causing quite the stir in town. Everyone’s talking about her.” His tone suggests he’s both amused and slightly exasperated, perhaps from the attention it’s drawing to him as well. “Seems like she’s got everyone guessing about her past and what she’s really up to here.” He leans back in his chair, crossing his arms, and gives me a look that’s a mix of curiosity and caution. “I just hope she knows what she’s getting into.”"
"“Officially: unclear. But I’m fairly sure my brother made CDs of it. Sent them to local TV stations and whatnot.” He gestures vaguely, and his forearm is dusted with freckles and pale-red hair. I want to grab his wrist, hold it in front","of my eyes, study it at my leisure. Trace, smell, touch. “I haven’t spent a holiday with the Floyd side of the family in twenty years, but I’m told that the video is a source of great entertainment for all age groups at Thanksgiving.”",87,"of the evidence, demanding answers. I imagine the CDs were filled with footage of the incident, perhaps even the mysterious figure he saw. The act of sending them to local TV stations suggests a desire for public awareness, a plea for someone, anyone, to take the claims seriously and investigate. His casual mention of it, however, indicates a level of desensitization or perhaps resignation to the lack of immediate action. The image of his freckled, hairy forearm, casually pointing as he recounts this potentially life-altering event, juxtaposes the gravity of the situation with the mundane details of his appearance. This contrast could imply a deep-seated frustration or helplessness, a feeling that despite having concrete evidence, his voice and experiences are still not being heard or taken seriously. My impulse to grab his wrist and demand more details, to somehow channel his urgency into action, is strong. It's a physical manifestation of my desire to bridge the gap between his experience and the inaction of those around him, to somehow make the invisible visible and the ignored important."
"The section is in C++. Which happens to be the very first language I taught myself back in high school, when every single Google search for “Skills + Necessary + NASA” led to the sad result of “Programming.” Python came after. Then SQL. Then HAL/S. For each language, I started out convinced that chewing on","glass would surely be preferable. Then, at some point along the way, I began thinking in terms of functions, variables, conditional loops. A little after that, reading code became a bit like inspecting the label on the back of the conditioner bottle while showering: not particularly fun, but overall easy. I do have some talents, apparently.",111,
"My heart rate picks up. Warmth twists in my lower stomach. I lean forward with a smile, feeling like I’m finally in my element. This, this, is what I know best. Depending on how busy I am with school, or work, or binge-watching K-dramas,","I do this about once a week. Which amounts to quite a bit of practice. “Maybe I could come to your place?” I say, finding the sweet spot between comically suggestive and Let’s get together to play Cards Against Humanity. “And you could show me?”",89,"there's always time to indulge in the art of baking. The rhythmic motion of kneading dough, the sweet scent of vanilla and cinnamon filling the air, and the satisfaction of seeing perfectly risen cakes or warm, golden-brown cookies emerge from the oven is unparalleled. It's a meditative process, one that requires focus and patience, yet it's incredibly rewarding. Each batch is an opportunity to experiment with new recipes, to tweak old ones, or to simply create something sweet and comforting. Whether it's for a special occasion or just a spontaneous treat, baking brings a sense of accomplishment and joy that few other activities can match. In moments of stress or uncertainty, turning to the kitchen and creating something beautiful and edible is a grounding experience, reminding me of the simpler pleasures in life."
"It sends me right over the edge. Into something that’s nothing like my usual, run-of-the-mill orgasm. Those tend to start like small fractures and then slowly, gradually deepen into something lovely and relaxing. Those are fun, good fun, but this . . . This pleasure is sudden and violent. It splinters into me like a wonderful, terrible explosion, new and frightening and fantastic,","and it goes on and on, as though every heart-stopping, delicious second of it is being squeezed out of me. I screw my eyes shut, clutch Ian’s shoulders, and whimper into his throat, listening to the hushed “Fuck. Fuck,” he mouths into my collarbone.

It's as if every nerve ending has been electrified, sending shockwaves through my entire being. My mind races, unable to focus on anything but the overwhelming sensation. It's primal, raw, and utterly consuming. I feel exposed, vulnerable, yet exhilarated all the same. It's a sensation so intense that it's almost painful, yet I crave more. It's a paradoxical blend of fear and ecstasy, leaving me questioning my sanity. I'm on the edge of a precipice, teetering between pleasure and pain, unable to pull myself back. It's a revelation, a discovery of a part of myself I never knew existed. This newfound intensity makes me wonder about the depths of my own desires, the boundaries of my own body. It's a terrifying and thrilling exploration, one that leaves me breathless and craving more."
"The last words I hear from him are, “It was really good to meet you, Hannah.” I think I should say it back, but there’s an unfamiliar weight in my chest, and I can’t quite bring myself to do it. So I","make do with a small smile and a halfhearted wave. I stuff my hands in my pockets while my body is still thrumming with what I left behind, and wander slowly back to the Caltech campus, thinking about red hair and missed opportunities.",85,"stand there, frozen, as the elevator doors close, leaving him inside and me outside, the echo of his words bouncing off the walls of the now empty shaft. My mind races, trying to make sense of the sudden heaviness that has settled in my chest, a sensation so foreign yet so unmistakably real. Was it regret for not having said the words back? Or perhaps something deeper, a fear of what those words might have meant to him? I lean against the elevator door, my heart pounding in my ears, as the building's hum surrounds me, a stark contrast to the silence within. The world seems to have slowed down, each second stretching into an eternity, as I grapple with the implications of my silence. Did I miss an opportunity to connect, to affirm a fleeting moment of human connection? Or was it a protective measure, a shield up to prevent further emotional entanglement? My mind is a whirlwind of questions, each more daunting than the last, as I wrestle with the uncertainty of what could have been. The elevator continues its descent, carrying him away, leaving me stranded in a moment of unspoken words and heavy silence. I push off the wall, my resolve hardening, determined to confront the whirlwind of emotions within me. There's a lesson here, a truth about vulnerability and the courage it takes to express our feelings, even when they're hard to articulate. As I walk away from the elevator, I make a silent vow to myself: to face the discomfort of the heart, to embrace the vulnerability that comes with human connection, and to never let another moment slip away unspoken again."
"The following day, when Mara asks me about my meeting with her cousin-or-something, I say only “Uneventful,” and I don’t even know why. I don’t like lying, and I like lying to someone","who’s rapidly becoming a friend even less, but I can’t make myself say any more than that. Two weeks later, I turn in a reflection paper as part of my Water Resources class requirements.",67,"less. She doesn't press me for details, which is a relief, but I can't shake the feeling that I've somehow disappointed her by not sharing more. As the day wears on, I find myself lost in thought, wondering if I should have been more forthcoming, or if keeping quiet was the right choice. My mind races with scenarios of what might have happened during her meeting with her cousin, and I realize how much I dislike not knowing. This uncertainty gnaws at me, making me feel disconnected from Mara, even though we're sitting just a few feet apart, sharing the same quiet room. The silence between us, while comfortable, is heavy with unspoken words and unshared truths. I wish I could go back and tell her everything, but fear of rejection or misunderstanding holds me back. As the sun begins to set, casting long shadows across the room, I realize that the truth, however painful, might be the only way to mend the growing distance between us."
"“Avalanche danger is set at the highest level, and it’s not safe for anyone to come out to get me,” I add, speaking right into the satphone’s mic. Repeating what Dr. Merel, my team leader, told me a few hours ago, during my last communication with AMASE, NASA’s home base here in Norway. It was right before he","reminded me that I’d been the one to choose this. That I’d known what the risks of my mission were, and I still decided to undertake it. That the path to space exploration is full of pain and self-sacrifice. That it was my fault for falling in an icy hole in the ground and spraining my fucking ankle.",116,

Keep up, will you?” I fail to",sound stern. “Have you not talked to her since she put us in touch?”,27,"remember it, as I am prone to forget things when distracted by your beautiful face,"" I joked, trying to lighten the mood and keep pace with her brisk walk down the cobblestone street, the early autumn air crisp and invigorating, carrying the faint scent of woodsmoke and the promise of an approaching winter.

Just, you know . . . saving the Earth.”",36,"take up a position at a research institute. She's passionate about environmental policy and has been working on a project to develop sustainable urban planning models. Her dedication to her field is truly inspiring, and I'm so proud of her accomplishments. It's not every day you see someone you've known since childhood achieve such significant success. I often think about how our childhood adventures prepared her for the challenges of academic and professional life. She always had a curious mind and a strong sense of justice, traits that have undoubtedly contributed to her success. I hope to visit her in D.C. soon and catch up on everything she's been doing. It would be great to see her in her new environment, working on projects that could potentially change the way cities are planned and built. Mara's journey is a testament to the power of education, perseverance, and following one's passions. I look forward to hearing more about her future endeavors and the impact they will have on the world."
"It is. AMASE is the shit, and the selection process to take part in an expedition was brutal, to the point that I’m not quite sure how I made it in. Probably sheer luck: Dr. Merel, one of the expedition leaders, was looking","for someone with experience in gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. Which I happen to have, due to some side projects my Ph.D. advisor foisted upon me. At the time, I aggressively bitched and moaned my way through them. In hindsight, I feel a bit guilty.",86,"for someone with my background. The training was intense, pushing us to our physical and mental limits. We learned about survival techniques, navigation, and the critical importance of teamwork in the unforgiving Arctic environment. The camaraderie that developed among us was palpable, a necessity for the challenges ahead. As we prepared, the goal of the AMASE expedition became clearer: to conduct geological surveys and collect samples that could provide insights into Earth's history, the movement of tectonic plates, and the potential for natural resources. Our journey would take us across the Svalbard archipelago, an area rich in scientific significance but also fraught with unpredictable weather and treacherous terrain. The expedition was not just a test of our skills but also a testament to human curiosity and the relentless pursuit of knowledge, even in the most inhospitable places on Earth."
"“Did something happen?” Karl, my office mate, asks from across the desk. “You look like","you’re about to cry. Or maybe throw something out of the window, I can’t tell.”",30,"you've seen a ghost,” I joke, trying to lighten the mood, but my voice cracks slightly, betraying the joke's sincerity."
"I don’t bother to glance at him. “Haven’t made up my mind, but I’ll keep you","updated.” I stare at the monitor of my computer, skimming the feedback letters from the internal reviewers.",33,"in consideration."" I turn away, my mind racing with the implications of his words and the weight of the decision that looms before me."
"As we all know, in early 2010, the rover Spirit became stuck in a sand trap, was unable to reorient its solar panels toward the sun, and froze to death as a consequence of its lack of power. Something very similar happened eight years later to Opportunity, which went into hibernation when a maelstrom blocked sunlight and prevented it from recharging its","batteries. Obviously, the risk of losing control of rovers because of extreme weather events is high. To address this, Dr. Arroyo has designed a promising internal system that is less likely to fail in the case of unpredictable meteorological situations. She proposes to build a model and test its efficacy on the next expedition at the Arctic Mars Analog in Svalbard (AMASE)—",124," batteries. Both rovers were designed to last for only 90 Martian days, yet they far exceeded expectations, with Spirit operating for over 6 Earth years and Opportunity for an astonishing 14 years. Their longevity was due in part to the Martian environment being less harsh than anticipated, allowing them to survive and operate far beyond their design specifications. The perseverance and ingenuity of the teams that operated these rovers were instrumental in their extended missions. Spirit's journey came to an end in 2011 when it was unable to communicate with Earth, presumed to have been covered by a dust storm. Opportunity, however, continued to send valuable data back to Earth until 2018, when it also fell silent, believed to have been overcome by a dust storm that blocked its solar panels. These missions provided invaluable insights into Martian geology, climate, and potential signs of past water activity, paving the way for future exploration and the eventual arrival of more sophisticated rovers like Curiosity and Perseverance. The legacy of Spirit and Opportunity is a testament to human curiosity and the relentless pursuit of knowledge about our neighboring planet."
"Dr. Arroyo’s project is a brilliant addition to NASA’s current roster, and it should be approved for further","study. Dr. Arroyo’s vitae is impressive, and she has accumulated enough experience to carry out the proposed work—",36,"development and testing. The potential for groundbreaking discoveries about the universe and our place within it is immense, and Dr. Arroyo's innovative approach aligns perfectly with NASA's mission to explore and expand our knowledge of space. The project's scientific merits are undeniable, and the investment in such cutting-edge research could yield invaluable returns for humanity's understanding of the cosmos."
"I met Dr. Merel because he was my direct superior during AMASE, and he is . . . an odd duck, honestly. Very stiff. Very hard-core. NASA is full of ambitious people, but he seems to be almost obsessed with results, publications, the kind of sexy science that makes","big splashy news. Initially I wasn’t a fan, but I must admit that as a supervisor he’s been nothing but supportive. He’s the one who selected me for the expedition to begin with, and he encouraged me to apply for funding once I went to him with my project idea.",99,"the front pages of scientific journals. He's the kind of person who would make a great leader if he could just soften up a bit, show some humanity. But he doesn't. He's all about the mission, the data, the next big discovery. When I first met him, I thought he was just a bit of a cold fish, but as I got to know him better, I realized that he genuinely doesn't know how to relate to people on a personal level. He's brilliant, no doubt about it, and he's driven – probably the best field geologist I've ever worked with, but he lacks that essential human touch that makes for great teamwork. During AMASE, he was always the first one out in the field, the last one to leave, and he expected the same level of dedication from everyone under his command. He's the kind of guy who would push you to your limits, and then some, but he wouldn't be there to offer a pat on the back or a word of encouragement. He's all about results, and if you can't keep up, well, that's your problem, not his. Despite his shortcomings, I can't help but admire his commitment to his work. He's a man on a mission, and if he has his way, he'll change the world with his science."
"“Yes. Of course it would have been convenient if you’d had those funds at your disposal, but I’ve already discussed it with two of","my colleagues who agree that your work is meritorious. They are in control of other funds that Floyd won’t be able to veto, so—”",48,"the other partners, and they agreed that it's best to keep our resources focused on the current projects until we've secured a stable foundation for future expansions.

We're confident that the right opportunities will present themselves in due time, and we'll be prepared to seize them when the moment is right."
"“I’ll be there, out in the field with you, of course,” Dr. Merel says. I’m a little surprised. In the months we were in Norway, I saw him do very little sample","collecting and snow plodding. I’ve always thought of him as more of a coordinator. But if he offered, he must mean it, and . . . I smile. “Perfect, then. Thank you.”",64,"collection, and now he's eager to participate in the fieldwork here in the Netherlands. ""I've missed the hands-on aspect of the research,"" he explains, ""and I want to contribute more directly to our findings."" His enthusiasm is infectious, and I find myself looking forward to the day's work with renewed vigor. We plan to meet early in the morning, ensuring we beat the heat and have ample time to set up our equipment before the sun climbs too high. Dr. Merel brings a portable generator, extra batteries for our data loggers, and a cooler with water to keep everything functioning smoothly. He's thought of everything, it seems, and his readiness to dive into the practicalities of our research project is both refreshing and reassuring. As we prepare to leave, I can't help but feel grateful for his commitment and the additional support he brings to our team. The fieldwork will be challenging, but with Dr. Merel by my side, I'm confident we'll make significant progress."
"The problems start when he looks up and notices me. He stops exactly two steps below, which should put him at a disadvantage but, depressingly, unfairly, tragically, doesn’t. We are at eye level when his","eyes widen and his lips curve in a pleased smile. He says, “Hannah,” a touch of something in his voice that I recognize but instantly reject, and I have no choice but to acknowledge him.",70,"expression hardens into something unreadable, a mask that hides his true feelings, if there are any left to hide. His eyes, once a soft blue, now seem to darken, reflecting the storm brewing within him. I am caught off guard, not by his sudden stop, but by the intensity of his gaze, a silent challenge that seems to question my every move, my every thought. It's as if he's trying to read me, to decipher the secrets I've kept hidden, the truths I've been too afraid to share. The silence stretches between us, thick and heavy, filled with unspoken words and the weight of our shared past. My heart races, caught in the intensity of the moment, unsure how to break the tension that has suddenly, inexplicably, sprung up between us. The world around us fades into insignificance, leaving only the space we occupy, charged with an energy that is both exhilarating and terrifying. In that moment, I realize that whatever comes next will change us irrevocably, tearing down the walls we've built around our hearts and forcing us to confront the raw, unfiltered truth of our feelings for each other."
"He doesn’t deny it, doesn’t defend himself, doesn’t scream that I’m insane. His","eyes narrow to blue slits and he asks, “It was Merel, wasn’t it?”",26,"silence is a confession, a silent plea for understanding or perhaps for mercy that"
"“Because he was there when I explained my objections, at length and in detail. Did he omit that?” I press my lips together. Which he seems to interpret as an opening. “Hannah.” He leans closer.

It's a rhythm I've come to know intimately, a steady, unwavering pulse that anchors me in the chaos of our world. His arms tighten around me, a silent vow of protection, a promise that in this moment, nothing else matters but the two of us. I cling to that promise, to his heartbeat, as if it alone can shield us from the horrors that lurk just beyond our embrace. His breath, warm against my hair, whispers words of comfort that I can't understand but desperately need to believe. In this fleeting respite, I allow myself to feel the weight of our situation, the gravity of our losses, and yet, in his arms, I find a strange solace. It's a fragile peace, a bubble of calm in a stormy sea, but it's enough to remind me that even in the darkest times, there is still light to be found, a flickering flame of hope that refuses to be extinguished. As I slowly regain my composure, I press closer, seeking to absorb more of his strength, more of his warmth, knowing that when we part, I must return to the harsh reality that awaits us. But for now, in this moment, I am just a girl clinging to her brother, finding refuge in the steady beat of his heart."
"“Who is M— Oh. Yeah. For the most part. Mom isn’t very fond of the Floyd side of the family. Though I’m sure he’s the black sheep by their standards, too.","I wasn’t really allowed to spend time with him, so . . .” He shakes his head, as if to change the topic. “Here. It’s not much, but you should eat.”",62,"She's always been a bit judgmental, especially when it comes to family. I think she sees the Floyds as a reflection of what she's tried to steer me away from. But Dad, he's different. He's more accepting, probably because he grew up around similar circumstances. He understands that people aren't defined by their family's reputation or their past mistakes. He believes in giving people a chance to change and prove themselves. That's why he's willing to help M— without hesitation. It's a lesson in forgiveness and second chances that I'm slowly learning from him."

And you are the opposite of incompetent.”",30,"fact, completely enveloped in his protective embrace, feeling a sense of safety and warmth that I hadn't known for a long time.

I am caught between the turmoil of my emotions and the serenity of his presence, wondering if this moment could possibly be real or if it's just a fleeting illusion. The world outside, with all its chaos and pain, seems distant, almost irrelevant, as we stand there, two souls intertwined in a silent promise of understanding and support."
"“Because of the intrinsic danger of a project like yours. For the past few months, I tried to get this project stopped in about ten different ways. Personal meetings, emails, appeals—I","tried it all. And even the people who agreed with me that it was too dangerous would not step in to prevent it. So no, you’re not the asshole, Hannah. They are.”",63,"have even gone as far as to speak with people in higher positions who could potentially pull the plug on it. Yet, here we are, at this critical juncture, with the project moving forward. The risks are immense: not just to the individuals directly involved, but to the broader community and the environment. The technology you're developing has the potential for both immense good and catastrophic misuse. I've seen enough to know that the safeguards in place are insufficient, and the oversight is lacking. We're playing with fire, and while I understand the allure of pushing boundaries, sometimes those boundaries are there for a reason. I urge you to reconsider, to find a way to redirect your considerable talents and resources towards a project that doesn't carry such a high stakes gamble. The world needs your brilliance, but it needs it harnessed responsibly. Please, think about the consequences beyond the immediate success or failure of this project."
"“Oh.” I swallow. “Merel was supposed to come for backup. But he wasn’t feeling well. I offered to wait for him, but he said we’d be losing valuable days of data and that I should just go","alone, and I . . .” I squeeze my fingers around the material of Ian’s shirt. “I went. And then, when I called in for help, he told me that the weather was turning, and . . .”",75,"and that I should just go ahead without him. I didn't want to leave him alone, especially since he's been having a rough time lately, but I also didn't want to jeopardize the mission. So, I took a deep breath, said a silent prayer for Merel's wellbeing, and headed out to the field alone. The silence of the early morning was almost deafening, and the weight of the responsibility on my shoulders felt heavier than I had anticipated. As I navigated through the dense foliage, I couldn't help but replay Merel's insistence in my mind, wondering if I was making the right decision. The thought of him alone at the base, possibly dealing with his personal issues, tugged at my conscience. I quickened my pace, trying to convince myself that I was doing the right thing for the greater good. Yet, the nagging doubt lingered, a shadow that accompanied me through the morning light."
"He shrugs. “I figured you might want to talk through your near-death experience with someone, so",I decided to tell Mara what happened. I did not expect her to come in person.”,32,"that's why I'm here,"" he adds, giving a small, encouraging smile, hoping his presence will provide the comfort she needs."
"“I was going to. Once I felt less whiny. And—whatever.” I roll my eyes. Wow,",I’m mature. “How did you go from not remembering Mara’s name to having her number?”,30,"she retorts, her voice dripping with sarcasm, clearly unimpressed by my lack of enthusiasm."
"“Well, still.” She shrugs. “I promise I don’t have anything against",you personally. I’m just not generally a fan of the Floyd family.”,23,you; I just think you should know what you're getting into.”
"“Yes,” Mara agrees. “Are you going to break my blood relative’s heart?","Don’t get me wrong, I’d still side with you. Hos before bros.”",24,"She asks, her voice trembling with a mix of fear and determination, hoping against hope that he won't, despite the pain it would cause her."
"“I guess we’ll see. I’m not sure he would want to date,” I say, staring at Sadie’s Froot Loops. The ensuing silence drags on so long,",I’m forced to look up. She and Mara are staring at me like I just announced that I’m quitting my job to take up macramé full-time. “What?”,53,"it feels like the cereal itself is judging me for my lack of insight into my best friend's love life. Finally, Sadie speaks up, her voice laced with a mix of frustration and hope, ""Well, what do you think? Should I ask him?"" The question hangs in the air, heavy with unspoken possibilities and the weight of our shared history watching from the corners of the small, cluttered kitchen."
"“Considering that he saved your life, contacted Great-Aunt Delphina, and put up two dudes he’s never seen",before so their girlfriends could hang out with you . . . I think maybe he does.”,34,"before, I'd say he's earned the right to ask for a favor in return,"" continued Sarah, her voice carrying a mix of gratitude and resolve."
"“Actually, they fixed the elevator. And this new cast is easy to walk on. So, no need. But you . . .” You can","do this, Hannah. Come on. You just survived polar bears thanks to this guy. You can say the words. “You could come up anyway.”",48,"continue to be a burden, dragging your feet and complaining about everything. It's high time you learned to appreciate the efforts others make to accommodate you and focus on being more self-reliant. We all have to adapt and adjust to changes; it's part of life. Consider this an opportunity to grow and become more independent."""
"“Right.” He sighs and bites into his lower lip. “Hannah, if that changes. If you ever find yourself able to believe that someone could care about you that much. And","if you wanted to actually . . . have dinner with that someone.” He lets out a laugh. “Well . . . Please, consider me. You know where to find me.”",61,"you want to give them a chance, don't hesitate. Because I... I might just be that person.” His voice trails off, a mix of vulnerability and hope lingering in the air between them."
“Hannah.” He gives me a skeptical look. “You have two friends who,dropped everything to be with you. And I assume sex wasn’t involved.”,24,are going to be in trouble when they find out you told me about their little secret.”
"“Hannah.” He unbuckles his seat belt and angles himself toward me, so that I have no choice but to look him in the eyes. He looks earnest and nearly offended. “I have thought about what happened in my office every day for the past five years. You offered to go down on me, and I just . . . embarrassed myself, and it should be the most mortifying memory I have, but for some reason it’s turned into the axis every fantasy of mine spins around, and”—he reaches up to pinch the bridge of his nose—“I want to fuck you.","Obviously. Always have. I just don’t want to fuck you once. I want to do it a lot. For a long time. I want you to come to me for sex, but also want you to come to me when you need help with your taxes and moving your furniture. I want fucking to be only one of the million things I do for you, and I want to be—” He stops. Seems to collect himself and straightens, as if to give me space. To give us space. “I’m sorry. I don’t want to crowd you. You can . . .”",201,
"He laughs, low and beautiful and a little rueful. And after looking at me like no","one else ever has before, what he says is, “Yes, Hannah. It is a yes on dinner.”",33,"one has ever looked before, he turns away, his laughter fading into the quiet of the room."
"“Um, I could make us a . . .” I scratch my head, studying the contents of my open fridge. Okay, so it’s full. The problem is, it’s full exclusively of stuff that needs to be cooked, chopped, baked, prepared. Stuff that’s healthy and doesn’t taste","particularly good. I am now 93 percent sure that Mara was the one who went shopping, because no one else would dare to impose broccoli on me. “How does one even . . . I could boil the broccoli, I guess? In a pot? With water?”",92,"particularly delicious. There's no instant food, no frozen pizza, no easy snacks. I sigh, closing the fridge door with a sense of defeat. My stomach growls, reminding me of the reality of the situation. I lean against the kitchen counter, pondering my options. I could make an omelet with the eggs I see, but that would require chopping vegetables and grating cheese. There's also a container of Greek yogurt that doesn't need much effort, but it's not exactly exciting. I could whip up a salad, but where's the dressing? I glance around the kitchen, taking in the array of fresh produce, the carton of eggs, the block of cheese, and the half-used bottle of olive oil. An idea starts to form. I could make a simple, yet satisfying meal. A salad with a homemade vinaigrette, using the olive oil and some balsamic vinegar I have. I could add grilled chicken, which I have in the freezer, defrosting it quickly in the microwave. To make it more interesting, I decide to add some sunflower seeds for crunch and a sprinkle of dried cranberries for sweetness. I move around the kitchen, gathering my ingredients. I defrost the chicken, chop some cucumber and tomatoes, and grate a bit of Parmesan cheese. I mix the vinaigrette in a small bowl, combining the olive oil and vinegar with a splash of lemon juice and a pinch of salt and pepper. The chicken goes on the grill pan, sizzling as it heats up. I toss the salad ingredients together, adding the vinaigrette just before serving. The chicken cooks quickly, the aroma filling the kitchen. I plate the salad, placing the grilled chicken on top, and garnish it with a few fresh basil leaves. It's not a five-star meal, but it's simple, healthy, and satisfying. I sit down to eat, grateful for the creativity that came from a moment of uncertainty. The meal is delicious, the flavors fresh and vibrant, a testament to the fact that sometimes, the best recipes come from the simplest of ingredients."
“Hannah.” His forehead touches mine. He laughs against my mouth. “Dinner is . . . it’s symbolic. A,"metaphor. If you tell me that you’re willing to see where things go, I believe you, and we can—”",37,"complete mockery of the traditional family meal, with each dish representing a facet of our crumbling relationship."""
"He is hot and huge. Closing his eyes, arching his neck before looking at me again with a half-warning, half-pleading expression. He finds me sitting","on his knees, his cock spasming in my grip as I lean over. “Hannah,” he says, even deeper than usual. “What are you . . .”",51,"on the edge of the bed, my expression likely one of confusion and curiosity. His gaze holds a mix of desire and a complex emotion I can't quite decipher, perhaps a hint of vulnerability. He takes a step closer, his presence filling the room with an intensity that makes my breath catch. His voice, when he speaks, is a low rumble, ""I need to tell you something, something I've kept hidden, fearing the reaction, the change it might bring between us. It's about my past, about things I've done, things I'm not proud of, but they've shaped who I am today. I hope you can understand, maybe even forgive, but most of all, I need you to know so that whatever happens next, it's with an open heart and no secrets between us."" His confession hangs heavy in the air, a mixture of relief and fear in his eyes, waiting for my response."
“Or maybe it’s the Vastitas Borealis.” He’s barely intelligible. Doing those little thrusts that are designed more to open me up than to,"fuck me properly, and yet we’re both this close to orgasm. It’s a little scary. “The oceans that used to fill it, Hannah.”",46,"communicate anything. His eyes, though, they're intense, like twin suns in the cold, dark void of space. They bore into me, making it hard to look away, hard to think of anything else but his words and the weight they carry. He's talking about the vastness of space, about how insignificant our problems are when we consider the universe. It's a strange comfort, in a way, to feel so small and yet so connected to the cosmos. His hands, which had been fidgeting, now rest on the table between us, fingers intertwined, as if he's trying to anchor himself to the moment, to the reality of our conversation. ""It's not just about the emptiness,"" he continues, his voice softer now, almost a whisper. ""It's about what's out there, waiting to be discovered, to be understood. It's about the potential, the endless possibilities. Maybe that's why it feels so... liberating."" His gaze softens, almost compassionate. ""Or maybe,"" he concludes, a small, sad smile playing on his lips, ""it's just the cold, reminding us that we're alone, more alone than we've ever been."" There's a long pause, heavy with unsaid things, before he finally stands up, pushing his chair back with a soft scrape against the floor. ""Anyway,"" he says, his voice back to its usual tone, ""I should probably get back to work."" He gives me a small, almost shy smile, as if he's sharing a secret, and then walks away, leaving me with the echo of his words and the weight of his silence."
