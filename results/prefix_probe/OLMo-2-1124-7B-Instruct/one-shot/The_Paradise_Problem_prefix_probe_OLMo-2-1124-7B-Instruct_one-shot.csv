The thought makes me a little sad, but then I remember I have the couch and T-virus zombies waiting for me inside.",73,completion
"“You, too.” West smiles that eye-crinkling smile again, and","damn, I really wish I’d seen it more. “Bye, Anna.”",19,"he reaches out, brushing a stray lock of hair from her face, his touch gentle and reassuring."
"I feel her attention move from the empty apartment to the side of my face, and when I smile","over at her, her blue eyes are round with worry. “Holy shit, Anna, I had no idea. Are you okay?”",39,"her eyes soften, reflecting a warmth that seems to fill the room, a silent acknowledgment of the bond we've formed in this unexpected solitude."
"“That is wonderful news, sweetheart! Oh, I’m so thrilled! Why don’t you fly down to John Wayne the night","before, stay at the house, and we’ll all take the plane over together? The flight to Singapore is a bear.”",39,"airport and surprise him with your presence? It will surely make his day and show him how much you care. Plus, it's a romantic gesture that could strengthen your bond and create unforgettable memories together."""
"“Anna?” he says, like he’s not entirely sure, and then does a full top-to-bottom sweep of my body, which recalls the lack of pants.","When he digs his hand into his luscious head of hair, I forget to be embarrassed again, because it all comes back to me.",48,"causing my cheeks to flush a deep crimson, a reaction he seems to find amusing, as a smirk plays on his lips, his eyes twinkling with a mix of curiosity and amusement at my evident discomfort."
The expression he makes is like the meme of that one kid who smiles and then immediately bursts into tears.,West is staring at me like he’s doomed but must pretend to be happy about it. “Anna. You look… great?”,40,"His eyes widen, a sudden shift from the innocent grin, as if he's just realized the gravity of the situation, his smile faltering, replaced by a look of sheer panic, his hands nervously fidgeting at his sides, betraying the inner turmoil that his outward demeanor desperately tries to conceal."
"Stepping aside, I let him pass, and he pulls up short at what’s on the television screen. Conan is",enthusiastically fucking a witch in a cave. We both clear our throats and look up at the ceiling instead.,38,"delivering a monologue about the absurdity of everyday life, his humor striking a chord with the late-night audience, his delivery impeccable, the laughter filling the room, a testament to his unique brand of comedy, a blend of wit and absurdity that has made him a household name, his presence on the screen a comforting familiarity, a beacon of light in the often-serious world of late-night talk shows, his ability to make people laugh a powerful tool, Conan O'Brien, the man behind the persona, known for his kindness and humility off-screen, a beloved figure in the entertainment industry, his show a blend of interviews, sketches, and his iconic 'In the Year 2000' segments, which have become a part of pop culture, his ability to connect with his audience genuine, his show a refuge for those seeking laughter and a break from the stresses of life, Conan's success a result of hard work, creativity, and an unwavering dedication to his craft."
"He adjusts his posture on the sofa, turning slightly to face me. Oh, right. He came here to","ask me for help. I sit up, too, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. Focus, Anna.",37,"discuss the matter of the missing artifact. His expression is serious, a stark contrast to the casual way he entered my home. He crosses his arms, leaning forward slightly, as if this conversation were of utmost importance."
"“I knew what Jake ordered for lunch and what kinds of stupid movies would make him laugh, and I could predict all his pickup lines","at parties, but we didn’t ever, like, sit down and do backstory. He didn’t even mention he had a brother until he suggested I marry you.”",51,"because he was as predictable as the sunrise. Yet, there was something about today that felt different. It was as if the usual patterns of his life had been disrupted by an unseen force, leaving him unusually quiet and contemplative. I noticed he didn't crack a single joke during our walk home, and when he finally spoke, his voice carried a weight it never had before. 'Hey, are you okay?' I asked, genuinely concerned. He paused, looking at the ground, and then he said something that caught me completely off guard: 'I've been thinking about the future, about what we're going to do next.' This was not the Jake I knew, the one who lived day by day without a care for tomorrow. It was as if a switch had been flipped, and suddenly, he was contemplating the very things he used to avoid. His change in demeanor puzzled me, and I couldn't help but wonder if something had happened that I wasn't aware of. Was there a new girl? A job change? Or perhaps, he was just growing up, realizing that the carefree days of youth were slipping away. Whatever it was, it was clear that Jake was at a crossroads, and I, his friend, was about to play a role I hadn't anticipated."""
"“I definitely need to go back to the beginning,” I say, wiping my eyes. I mime an explosion at my temples. “Like—my mind is blown right now. You dressed like a middle schooler around the house. All basketball shorts, all the time. You drove a Honda! West, you’re incognito rich!","No wonder Jake never told me anything about his family! I would have made him pay for Jersey Mike’s every fucking time! Wait. Why did you need to live on campus? If you’re the grandson of the founder of Weston’s, you could probably buy an entire apartment building on Sunset.”",100,
"That lands in a puddle of silence, and it hits me after a couple of seconds filled only",with the sound of Conan kicking someone’s ass on TV that West expects me to catch his meaning.,36,"with the weight of my own thoughts, each more heavy than the last, drowning out any hope of an answer or escape from the quiet that now seemed to suffocate me."
“Correct.” He looks down to his lap. “Only Jake knew the real situation. The rest of my family was disappointed that,"I didn’t let them throw me a big wedding, but I guess they weren’t all that surprised. I’ve always been private.”",42,"their plans for my future were not coming to fruition as they had hoped. I couldn't tell them the truth about my decision to leave, fearing their disappointment would be unbearable, and I was too proud to accept their pity. Instead, I chose to disappear, hoping that time would heal the wounds of our fractured relationship and that one day they might understand my choice."
"He looks me over again, top to bottom, and the defeat in his eyes makes me realize the true extent of my unshowered, feral chaos. “Actually,","Anna,” he says, “I need you to come with me to my sister’s wedding in Indonesia and convincingly play the part of my very loving wife.”",52,"it's not just the dirt and the grime that's the issue; it's the fact that I've let myself go completely, that I've become unrecognizable even to myself. He shakes his head, a mixture of disappointment and concern etched on his features, and I feel a pang of guilt for having let him down so thoroughly. ""You need to clean up,"" he says, his voice firm yet gentle, ""not just your appearance, but your life. This isn't you, and it's high time you started living up to who you really are."""
"It’s surreal to be here with her after all this time. I was so close to being done with this, so near to the finish line, yet here I am, having to improvise an intricate plan B at the eleventh hour with a Muppet in human form as my co-conspirator. Don’t get me wrong, beneath the baked, unshowered disarray, Anna is still a beautiful woman, with enormous brown eyes, creamy skin, and long, willowy limbs. I’d always been fascinated with the perfect beauty mark just above her lip. Unfortunately, right now she looks like","she’s fallen out of a tree and crawled through a field of tangly briers to get back to her apartment. This is probably the closest I’ve ever seen to her natural hair color because the pink has grown out a good inch, leaving a stripe of brown at her roots. Her makeup is, I presume, from yesterday; shadows of mascara carve dark circles beneath her eyes. Despite the old makeup and frazzled appearance, there’s still something striking about her. Her eyes are enormous and bright, framed with dark lashes, her steady gaze entirely without artifice.",189,
"Though I am nearly certain her mind has wandered to something other than the topic at hand, I let her stare at the wall",a little longer so I can stare at her and reconcile this version of Anna with the one I lived with for two years.,48,"for a few moments longer, hoping she will eventually share her thoughts, even if they are far removed from our conversation. Her silence stretches on, a thick veil over whatever storm is raging within her, and I find myself growing increasingly anxious, wondering if I should gently prompt her or give her the space she might need to collect her thoughts and find the words to express what's troubling her. The room seems to grow quieter, the ticking of the clock sounding louder in the absence of her voice, and I realize that sometimes the most profound conversations require patience and a willingness to sit in the uncomfortable space of uncertainty, trusting that eventually, the silence will break and the truth will emerge."
"As roommates, we didn’t know each other well—that much is probably obvious—but there is an intimacy to sharing a space with someone, a certain kind of kinship that comes with daily proximity. Anna was reasonably tidy and paid her half of the rent when it was due, but she’d never struck me as the organized, driven, premed type. The one time we talked about it, she","said something about medicine being the most palatable of the “real job” options, but she seemed overwhelmed a lot, studying late into the night and painting to decompress in what little free time she had. That she ultimately switched her major to fine art makes a certain amount of sense, but I want to punch myself for not realizing she wasn’t studying medicine at all anymore.",132,
"Anna squints at me. “You said ‘small,’ but I think you meant","‘private.’ Your sister is getting married on a private island, isn’t she?”",24,"large’” she accuses, her voice laced with suspicion and a hint of amusement."
"“Yes.” I work to not let my gaze do another sweep of her apartment. I’ve never been to Pulau Jingga, but my mom has been sending me info that I’ve mostly ignored for months. I know the basic idea—a luxury resort and conservation area set in the Indonesian archipelago—and it’s about","as far from this dark, cramped living room as I can imagine. Right now, I need Anna to believe she can do this. Yes, she may be at rock bottom, but I need her to think she is just one fairy godmother moment away from sliding gracefully into the world she’s imagining.",103,"the backdrop for the wedding of a distant cousin I barely remember. My mother, however, has been planning for this event as if it were her own daughter's wedding. She's sent me countless photos of the island's pristine beaches, luxurious villas, and the elaborate wedding cake that seems to dominate every photo she's sent. She's mentioned the traditional Indonesian attire she plans to wear, the fusion cuisine that will be served, and the cultural performances that will entertain the guests. She's even gone so far as to suggest that I, as the closest family member, should wear a traditional batik sarong, despite my protests that I have no interest in participating in a cultural display I know little about. My mother's enthusiasm is infectious, yet I find myself conflicted. On one hand, I want to appease her by showing some interest, on the other, I dread the thought of spending a week in a place that feels so foreign to me, especially when I'm already overwhelmed with my current responsibilities at work. The idea of a beach vacation sounds lovely, but the reality of attending a relative's wedding, especially one so far from home and so foreign to my own experiences, fills me with a sense of dread. I wonder if I should just bite the bullet and agree to go, perhaps it would be a good opportunity to step out of my comfort zone. But then again, I worry about the expense, the time off work, and the effort it would take to prepare for such a trip. As I stand there, lost in thought, I realize that I need to have a conversation with my mother, to discuss my reservations and perhaps find a compromise that would satisfy both our desires."
"Anna looks down at herself and I follow her attention to the front of her shirt, where a Froot Loop adheres to the cotton over her left breast.",She plucks it off and pops it into her mouth. “Why not just find someone who can pretend to be me and who knows how to behave around societay?”,57,"It's a bizarre sight, a colorful cereal loop seemingly glued to her shirt, and it causes a mixture of confusion and amusement among the group of us who had gathered around Anna in the break room. She looks embarrassed yet slightly amused herself, her cheeks flushing a rosy hue. She tries to flick it off, but it remains stubbornly in place. I reach out, gently plucking the Froot Loop from her shirt, holding it up between my fingers for all to see. The room erupts in laughter, the tension from earlier dissipating as we share a moment of levity. Anna rolls her eyes but can't hide a small smile, grateful for the distraction. I pocket the Froot Loop, musing about the strange turn of events that led to this moment, and how it will become one of those absurd stories we recount whenever we gather as a group."

"Anna points at me again. “Okay, I see that look, and so",let me ask: what manner of clothes are required on this trip?”,24,"you think you're special or something,” she says, rolling her eyes."
"“No, no, no.” Anna sits up and runs her fingers under her eyes, clearing away much of the mascara there. She pulls her ponytail free and reties it. Both actions do wonders for how chaotic she looks.",“This is much more demanding. I’ll have to act. I’ll have to learn about everyone I’ll be meeting. I’ll have to manage your complete lack of humor. I’ll have to hobnob. This is an entirely new skill set.”,75,"As she smooths down her shirt and adjusts her posture, trying to regain some semblance of composure, her eyes dart around the room, searching for an escape or perhaps a sympathetic face. Her breathing, though slightly calmer than before, still betrays her inner turmoil. She opens her mouth as if to speak, but no words come out, her throat seemingly seized by a sudden, inexplicable tightness. Anna's hands, once steady, now tremble slightly, and she clasps them together in her lap, her knuckles turning white from the pressure. The silence in the room, once filled with the hum of conversation and the clinking of glasses, now seems deafening, each sound echoing in the cavern of her mind. She wonders if anyone else notices the storm raging within her, or if they too are caught up in their own worlds, oblivious to the turmoil of the young woman sitting among them."
"“Babe, babe,” she says, cupping my cheeks. “There is",no downside here. Are you kidding? This is life-altering good.”,19,"something I need to tell you, something important.” Her eyes, wide with a mix of fear and urgency, hold mine, demanding the truth."
"“Insurance,” she says. “These people insure everything.” While I continue to stare at the rock, she returns to the list and laughs. “Get","this: ‘Anna, please feel free to schedule any hair, nails, spa, or grooming appointments and use the card to pay for those.’ ”",46,"their insurance for sunsets, for crying out loud!” She shakes her head, amused by the absurdity, and I finally break my gaze away from the rock, feeling a bit embarrassed for having been so captivated by something so ordinary. “I guess nothing is too mundane to protect with insurance these days,” I remark, trying to join in her amusement and lighten the mood. “Next, they’ll be insuring the air we breathe,” I joke, though deep down, the thought doesn’t seem as far-fetched as it should. She chuckles, nodding in agreement, and we both share a moment of laughter, the sound mingling with the gentle rustle of the leaves around us. “Well, at least it keeps the insurance brokers busy,” she says, her tone shifting to one of mild sympathy for the industry. “I suppose in a way, it’s a form of job security.” Our conversation flows easily from there, the initial awkwardness melting away as we discuss the quirks of human nature and the lengths to which people will go to safeguard their interests, no matter how trivial they may seem to an outsider.

"I can’t entirely refute this idea. I’ve been out of my parents’ circle long enough to understand how disorienting it will be for Anna to step into it.

Frankly, they’re so pointy I’m worried she’ll scratch her own cornea.","“But I asked the woman at the spa what the really rich ladies get, and she said it’s this fancy hard gel.

"“Okay, okay. I’m on my way.” Slinging her purse over my shoulder and collecting our carry-ons, I make my way to the ladies’ room, where","Anna peeks out into the hallway. As soon as she sees me, she reaches forward, grabbing the front of my shirt and jerking me inside.",50,"my reflection stares back at me, a mix of nerves and excitement painting my face. I take a deep breath, steadying myself for the journey ahead, knowing that this trip with Alex is more than just a vacation; it's a leap into the unknown, a chance to explore not only new places but also the depths of our relationship. As I step out of the restroom, my heart races with anticipation, ready to face the adventures that await us, hand in hand."
Apologizing over her shoulder to a woman washing her hands at the sink—“I swear we,aren’t going to have sex in here!”—Anna pulls me into a stall and flips the lock.,31,"she didn't mean to bump into her,” she continued, her voice tinged with a mix of embarrassment and concern, as she hurriedly gathered her things and exited the small, cramped space of the kitchen, leaving the woman with a look of mild annoyance but also a hint of understanding in her eyes."
"“I need you there,” I clarify. “And I need you to look like you’re comfortable with me, comfortable","being married to me. But I don’t need you to pretend to not be Anna Green, Muppet-human hybrid.”",36,"because we're friends and it's just us hanging out, nothing more, nothing less,"" I add, hoping my words convey the simplicity and platonic nature of my request, aiming to ease any potential confusion or misinterpretation of my intentions."

"Once, when we were roommates, Anna flew to Seattle with a friend. It had been her first time on an airplane, and she struggled so much navigating the travel website that she brought me her laptop at midnight and asked for help. I finished the transaction for her, prebooked the car","to the airport, and then quietly tracked the ride the day she left to make sure she got there okay. When she got home, she made a point of thanking me for the help. Apparently, the trip itself was fine, but the highlight for her had been flying on an airplane.",102,"and arranged the accommodations. She was so grateful that she cried, overwhelmed by the relief of not having to handle everything alone. That night, as I lay in bed, I thought about how we often underestimate the challenges others face, assuming our own experiences are universal. The next day, Anna's friend texted me, thanking me profusely for my help, saying it made the trip much less stressful. It was a small act, but it reminded me of the importance of compassion and support in our lives. As the years passed, we drifted apart, but that memory stayed with me, a testament to the impact of kindness and understanding."

I feel her looking at me for a quiet beat. “I think you’re joking. I’m,not sure.” Anna downs the rest of her prosecco. “A hint of danger. I like it.”,31,"not sure what you're implying, but I'm not laughing,” I reply, trying to keep my voice steady, though my heart is pounding with a mix of confusion and concern."
“Is now a good time to discuss how you looked at me like I was lobotomized when I thought,your name was West Weston and yet a man named Kellan McKellan actually exists and will soon be your relative?”,39,you were utterly confused and had no idea what I was talking about?”

She wears a simple, yet elegant dress, indicative of her taste, which has always been impeccable. Her hair, now graying gracefully, is styled in a way that suggests she's made no concessions to age, holding onto her youthful spirit with grace. She extends a hand, her fingers adorned with simple yet elegant jewelry, a testament to her refined taste. Her smile, though practiced, doesn't quite reach her eyes, a subtle hint of the past's pain lingering beneath the surface. ""How have you been, dear?"" she asks, her voice carrying the melody of a lifetime spent in genteel society, yet there's an edge to it, a reminder of the hardships she's endured. Her presence is a mix of the old world charm and the resilience of someone who's navigated through life's storms. As I sit across from her, I realize this meeting, however fraught with emotional complexity, is a step towards understanding the woman who raised the man I married. Her gaze lingers on me, as if trying to decipher the person I've become, a blend of her influence and the choices I've made along the way. It's a moment heavy with the weight of our shared history, yet also filled with the potential for healing and reconciliation."

"I walk back inside, realizing I’d been so focused on the sleeping situation, I haven’t properly flailed over the sheer bliss that is our bungalow. In fact, I’m pretty sure the only thing in here I could afford is the roll of eco-friendly toilet paper I can clearly see from where I stand. And even that looks pretty fancy.

I need to get my act together, focus on the game, not the consequences of getting caught. I take a deep breath, trying to center myself, reminding myself of the plan. I'll fake an injury, something with my knee, maybe a charade of sudden pain. That'll buy me time, give me a chance to get out of this without digging a deeper hole.

Will this moment, this simple exchange of words, be the beginning of something beautiful? Or is it just a fleeting comfort in a world that often seems cold and indifferent? As I stand there, lost in thought, the sun begins to set, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink. The day ends, but the warmth of her smile lingers, a promise of something yet to come."
"Her hand falls away. “That’s Anna motherfucking Green-hyphen-Weston to you.” She lets out a happy squeal, jogging over",to hug him as well as she can without spilling the shots on either of them. “You look amazing!”,37,"to embrace her tightly, tears streaming down her cheeks, a mixture of relief and joy evident in her expression."
"The two of them walk back to me, and Jake looks over",his shoulder to make sure we’re alone. “How are my favorite liars doing?”,25,"with a mix of pride and concern, as if he's both impressed by my presence and worried about what might happen next."
"“Describe her,” Jake says, leaning in, his hair falling over his forehead in thick waves. There are moments where I see the man he could someday be: playful but grounded, flirtatious but loyal,",clever but humble. I want to know that version of him and worry he will forever be frozen in this caricature of the irresponsible youngest son as long as he works for Weston’s.,66,"possessing a gentle strength that could weather any storm. Yet, there's a flicker in his eyes, a shadow that suggests he's seen more than his years should allow, hinting at a past filled with complexities and perhaps pain. He looks at me, waiting for my description, as if my words could capture the essence of a soul that's both familiar and enigmatic. I take a breath, trying to piece together the myriad of impressions she leaves on me. She carries herself with an air of quiet confidence, her movements graceful yet deliberate, as if every step is a choice, a decision made after careful consideration. Her voice, when she speaks, is soft yet commands attention, weaving through the noise effortlessly. She has this way of listening that feels profound, as if she's truly present, understanding more than what's being said. Her laughter is rare but infectious, a sound that lights up the room and makes you want to be around her. Her eyes, they're a deep blue, like the ocean at dusk, reflecting a depth of emotion and a reservoir of untold stories. She has this unique ability to make you feel seen, understood, as if she's peering into the very core of your being. Yet, there's a certain distance, a veil that she keeps, hinting at a guarded heart, perhaps protecting herself from getting too close. Despite this, or maybe because of it, there's an undeniable pull towards her, an instinctive desire to break through that barrier and know her fully. She's a puzzle, a mystery wrapped in the guise of a woman, and I find myself utterly captivated, unable to look away."
"Anna barks out a bawdy laugh before covering her mouth with her hand. “Sorry,” she says",from behind it. The diamond on her ring flashes in the flickering light. “That surprised me.”,32,"but the mischief in her eyes betrays her. She leans in closer, lowering her voice to a conspiratorial whisper, ""but it's just too good not to share."" Her gaze flits to the others at the table, ensuring her secret is safe with them before she continues, ""You should've seen the look on his face when he realized what was happening."" Her laughter bubbles up again, a bit more subdued this time, but still full of glee."
"“Good. Anna has no poker face. How’s she taking everything?” he asks, and","I know what he’s referring to: the planes, the island, the money. The family.",27,"she tries to maintain her composure, but her eyes betray a flicker of sadness, hinting at the emotional turmoil she's experiencing inside."
"With a laugh, Jake rids himself of our shot glasses and snags two tumblers of whiskey off a passing tray. He","hands me one before lifting his own. “Well, whatever. To the final few months: if you pull this off, you’re free.”",42,"raises them in a toast, ""To new beginnings!"" The crowd in the dimly lit bar echoes his sentiment with a chorus of clinks and laughter, the sound mingling with the low hum of conversation and the occasional clatter of glasses being set down on the worn wooden bar. Jake takes a sip, his eyes scanning the room, a smirk playing on his lips as he takes in the scene around him, clearly enjoying the sense of camaraderie and the thrill of the moment. His friends gather closer, their faces alight with excitement and anticipation for whatever adventure comes next, their voices rising and falling in a lively cadence as they share stories and jokes, the atmosphere thick with the heady mix of alcohol and the promise of excitement. The bar, a place often frequented by those seeking solace or escape, tonight becomes a hub of vibrant life, all centered around Jake's infectious enthusiasm and the unspoken bond of friendship that ties them together."
"He looks past me at the party, and I take stock of how he seems from the outside. He’s got Dad’s dark wavy hair and light brown eyes, but like me, he got his height from our mother, who","is almost six feet tall without the benefit of heels. Jake is good-looking, charismatic, and always up for some (mostly) good-hearted shit-stirring. My stomach sours with guilt for what I’m keeping from him. What I could potentially fuck up.",78,"stands at a modest five foot ten. His posture is relaxed, yet there's a certain confidence in the way he holds himself. His smile, warm and genuine, lights up his face, revealing a set of straight, white teeth. He's wearing a well-fitted suit that accentuates his athletic build, suggesting he takes care of his physical health. His hands, which are clasped behind his back, appear steady and sure. As he moves through the crowd, people seem to gravitate towards him, drawn by his easygoing demeanor and the way he listens intently when others speak. His laughter is infectious, and it's clear he's well-liked by those around him. He carries himself with a sense of purpose, as if he knows exactly who he is and where he's going. It's this self-assurance that makes him stand out, not with arrogance, but with a quiet strength that seems to say he's in control of his destiny. His presence is both comforting and intriguing, leaving me with a sense of admiration and a slight pang of familial rivalry. I wonder what his story is, what he's accomplished, and what he hopes to achieve. He seems like the kind of person who leaves a lasting impression on everyone he meets, and I can't help but feel a bit envious of the impact he effortlessly exudes."
"She laughs, angling her wrist so the diamond catches the lights overhead. “I know, right? For six months I just walked",around taking photos where I had to casually point at something with my left hand.” She scans the crowd. “Where’s Anna?”,42,"around with this thing on my finger, pretending it was just a piece of jewelry. But now, it's like a part of me, a symbol of my new life,” she concludes, her voice filled with a mix of pride and a hint of melancholy, as if the ring were both a trophy and a reminder of a past she's trying to leave behind."
"I look up, too, searching the room again. She’s over by the dance floor, jumping around with little Nixon’s hands in hers.","The band is playing covers of pop hits, and Anna is entirely in her element: laughing, dancing, blissfully forgetting where she is.",44,"Her laughter fills the air, infectious and bright, as she twirls him around, clearly enjoying the moment. Nixon's face lights up with pure joy, his small frame barely reaching her waist as they dance. It's a simple, innocent scene, yet it strikes a chord within me, reminding me of the beauty found in the smallest of moments. I find myself smiling, watching them, wishing for a moment that life could be as uncomplicated and joyful as that dance. It's a stark contrast to the complexities and challenges that seem to shadow my own life, making me question what I'm truly searching for amidst the chaos. Perhaps, in some way, I envy their simplicity, their ability to find happiness in each other's presence without a care for the world outside. As I continue to watch, lost in thought, I realize how much I miss those simple joys, the kind that doesn't require much but the presence of someone who makes you feel loved and understood. It's a poignant reminder of the human condition, the need for connection and love, no matter the age or circumstance. In that moment, surrounded by the noise of the party, their dance stands out as a beacon of pure, unadulterated happiness."
"Janet smiles tightly. “Exactly.” Welp, there it is. She turns her",laser focus to me. “How do your professors react to your hair?”,23,"eyes to the floor, avoiding any further eye contact, her mind racing with the implications of her own admission."
"“It’s unlikely,” I say, and every head turns my way. “Everyone needs seven to nine hours of sleep a night. You can try to convince yourself","you don’t need more, but over time you’ll build up a sleep debt. It probably affects your mental and physical health more than you realize, Alex.”",52,"that you're getting enough, but your body will eventually rebel against the lack of rest. The truth is, sleep is a vital component of our overall health, allowing our bodies to repair and rejuvenate themselves, consolidating memories, and maintaining optimal function across all systems. Without sufficient sleep, cognitive performance declines, mood swings become more frequent, and the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease increases. Moreover, adequate sleep is crucial for cognitive processes like learning, decision-making, and problem-solving. It's a non-negotiable part of a healthy lifestyle, and while some may boast about their ability to function on less, they're likely compromising their long-term well-being."
"“And what’s the deal with Alex? Based on the way you talked about him on the plane, I expected you","two to jovially poke at each other, but that was like dragging a proverbial sword through each other with your eyeballs.”",41,"to be best friends or something. He seems like a cool guy, but you barely mentioned him since we've been here."""
"“Well, mostly because he’s an asshole. But also, kids growing up in a normal family get to be themselves, whoever that may be. But in families like","ours, one where everything basically revolves around keeping a single person happy—my dad—everybody has a role. My therapist used to refer to Alex as a flying monkey.”",54,"his, they often have to wear a mask, pretending to be something they're not, just to fit in or to avoid conflict. It's like they're constantly walking on eggshells, never knowing when they might say or do something 'wrong' that could upset the precarious balance in the household. This constant pressure to conform can stunt their emotional growth and make it harder for them to form healthy, authentic relationships later in life. It's a sad cycle that perpetuates dysfunction and leaves lasting scars on the psyche."
"“Like in The Wizard of Oz? Alex was my dad’s willing henchman, doing everything he said, kissing his ass, stirring up","shit just to turn us all in, then sit back and look like the good guy. He’s never grown out of it.”",43,"his orders without question, even when they were clearly wrong or harmful. It was a twisted bond, one built on fear and obedience rather than love or respect. Alex never questioned his father's authority, no matter how cruel or irrational his demands might be. This blind loyalty led to a series of unfortunate events, causing pain not only to others but also to Alex himself, who never had the chance to see beyond the facade of power and dominance his father projected. In the end, it was a sad display of how toxic relationships can warp individuals, making them complicit in actions they would otherwise never consider. The consequences of such blind obedience were far-reaching, affecting everyone involved in the web of manipulation and control that Alex's father had woven around him and others."
"“What does that mean?” I ask. If Alex knew enough, he wouldn’t try",to take West down? Is this about the mysterious loophole in the trust?,26,"to explain it to me. His silence is deafening, and I feel a growing sense of unease as I realize he might not know the answer himself, which contradicts the image of him as the knowledgeable one in our group."
West sits on the bench and pulls a shoe off. I set my clutch down on a shelf in the open closet. “I’m thinking Alex will take a keen,"interest in exactly how happy we seem.” I narrow my eyes, staring into the distance. “West… this assignment is no longer just ‘show up and wear a wedding ring.’ ”",59,"interest in cars,” I continue, hoping my casual demeanor masks the nervousness that's knotting my stomach. “He's always been good with his hands, you know? Maybe he'll want to work on them as a hobby, or even something more.” I pause, letting the silence fill the space as I try to gauge his reaction, hoping my suggestion doesn't come off as too pushy or presumptuous. “It's just an idea,” I add, trying to soften the potential imposition of my thoughts. “But if he's interested, there are plenty of resources around here. Workshops, online courses, even some community groups that meet up to tinker on weekends. Could be a good way for him to make friends, too, you know?” My voice trails off, leaving the possibility hanging in the air, hoping it might spark a thought or interest in his mind. I shift slightly, feeling the weight of the moment, wishing I could read his thoughts as easily as I read the manuals and repair guides I've grown so fond of. “Anyway,” I say, trying to break the tension, “I just thought it might be something to consider. It's just an idea, after all.”"
"I woke up around two this morning to find Anna wrapped around me. Despite what she’d told me about sleeping in one place all night, at some point she’d migrated across the massive bed to throw a","leg over my hip, send an arm over my torso, and press her face to my neck. It took monumental focus to not go hard against her inner thigh, and because of it, I’d slept like absolute shit.",75,"warm and protective embrace. Her soft breath tickled my neck, and I felt a warmth spread through me, a mixture of affection and concern for her well-being. I gently untangled myself from her arms, careful not to wake her, and got out of bed, my feet touching the cold floor, which seemed to jolt me back to reality. The moonlight streamed through the slightly ajar curtains, casting a ghostly glow over the room. I walked over to the window, pulling the curtains shut to block out the light, and looked out into the quiet street below. The city was asleep, save for the occasional distant sound of a car passing by or the hoot of an owl. It was a rare moment of solitude in our bustling lives, and I took a moment to appreciate it. I then turned back towards the bedroom, where Anna still slept peacefully, her face relaxed and free of the usual tension that marked her waking hours. I couldn't help but smile at the thought of her, knowing that despite her tough exterior, she was vulnerable and human underneath. I decided to make her a cup of coffee, a small gesture that might bring a bit of warmth to her morning. As I moved around the kitchen, the familiar sounds and sensations grounded me, the quiet hum of the refrigerator, the soft clink of cups, the aroma of coffee beans grinding. It was a simple routine, but it was mine, and in that moment, it felt like a precious piece of normalcy in our chaotic lives."
"My father’s question penetrates my fog, finally, and I straighten, pushing my salt-water-and-sweat damp hair off my forehead. The sun has only","just come up and it’s already sweltering. I bet Anna has already kicked off the blankets, letting the air cool her overheated skin.",45,"just begun to set, casting a golden glow over the water and the beach, making everything look almost ethereal. I take a deep breath, the salty air filling my lungs, grounding me in the moment. My father's gaze is steady, expectant, and I realize this is more than just a casual visit; it's a test, a moment to prove something to him. He's always been the stoic one, the one who never showed his emotions, but now, standing here, I sense a vulnerability in him that I've never seen before. It's as if the years of silence between us, the unspoken words and the distance we've built, are all converging here, on this beach, under the fading light of the day. I search his face for clues, for a hint of what he expects from me, but all I find is the same unreadable expression he's worn for as long as I can remember. Yet, despite the uncertainty, I feel a surge of determination. I will not let this moment slip away. I will bridge the gap that has grown between us, not with words, but with actions. I take a step closer, my heart pounding with a mix of fear and resolve. ""Dad,"" I begin, my voice steady, ""I know we've not been close, and there's a lot we've never talked about. But standing here now, I feel like we have a chance to change that. I want to understand you, and I want you to understand me. Let's talk,"" I propose, extending my hand towards him, a symbol of my willingness to bridge the divide. The sun dips lower, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, a beautiful backdrop to what could be the beginning of a new chapter in our lives."
"“JESUS CHRIST,” I BLURT, the second I turn at the corner of our bridge and step onto the deck of our bungalow. Anna is curled up in","a papasan, with a sketch pad in her seemingly bare lap. Honestly, from the first glimpse I get, I think she might be naked. “What are you doing?”",55,"the couch, her eyes closed, a serene smile playing on her lips. The suddenness of my exclamation startles her awake, her eyes fluttering open to meet mine, filled with confusion and concern. ""What's wrong?"" she asks, her voice laced with sleep and worry. I stand there, dumbstruck, the words I had so hastily prepared sticking in my throat. My heart pounds against my chest, a drumbeat of panic and disbelief. ""I... I thought you were..."" I stutter, my mind racing to find a coherent thought amidst the chaos of my emotions. ""Thought I was what?"" Anna prompts gently, her expression softening, trying to understand the turmoil she sees painted across my face. ""I thought you were..."" I swallow hard, the words finally breaking free, ""I thought you were gone."" My voice is a mere whisper, barely audible over the sound of the waves gently lapping against the bungalow's wooden sides. Anna sits up, concern etching deeper lines into her face as she takes in my disheveled appearance, my hands trembling slightly. ""Gone?"" she echoes, her confusion growing into something more profound. ""Why would you think that?"" she asks, her voice steady, trying to anchor me in the present moment. I take a step closer, my feet heavy on the wooden planks, my gaze never leaving hers. ""I saw it,"" I confess, the admission feeling like a weight being lifted off my chest, yet somehow also dragging me deeper into the abyss of my own fears. ""I saw it in the water,"" I continue, my voice gaining strength, ""a shadow, something... something that shouldn't be there. It was fleeting, just a glimpse, but it was unmistakable."" Anna listens, her eyes never leaving mine, her expression shifting from confusion to concern, then to something akin to resolve. ""You saw a shadow,"" she says slowly, as if unraveling a complex puzzle, ""and you assumed it was me?"" I nod, feeling foolish yet unable to deny the irrational leap my mind had made. ""I'm sorry,"" I say, the words feeling inadequate against the depth of my fear and relief. ""I overreacted. It was just a shadow, nothing more."" Anna stands, moving closer, her presence a comfort. ""Let's look,"" she suggests, her voice calm, her eyes reflecting a determination to face whatever fear I had conjured. We step outside, the night air cool against our skin, the moon casting a silver glow over the water. As we scan the horizon, the bridge behind us, the bungalow before us, the fear that had gripped me moments ago begins to dissipate. The night is peaceful, the only sounds the gentle lapping of the waves and the distant call of nocturnal creatures. ""See?"" Anna says softly, her hand finding mine, her warmth seeping through my skin. ""It's just the night, just the water. You're safe."" I nod, a deep breath filling my lungs with the salty air, the irrationality of my fear now clear. ""Thank you,"" I whisper, feeling a profound sense of relief and gratitude. ""For not letting me face this alone."" We stand there for a moment longer, the bridge behind us a reminder of the leap I had taken, both in fear and in trust. As we turn to head back inside, the night feels different, less ominous, filled with the promise of peace and understanding. The shadow I had seen was just that—a shadow, a trick of the light, a manifestation of my own anxieties. And in the quiet aftermath, I realize how much stronger I feel, having shared my fear with Anna, having faced it together."
"Anna follows me. She’s loosely made the bed, but it still looks rumpled.",Slept in. By both of us. I squeeze my eyes shut against the reminder.,27,"Anna's actions suggest a lack of care, perhaps indicative of her current emotional state or disinterest in the environment around her."
I sigh. I know she’s right but I’m already sleep-deprived and functioning on less than full brain power today.,I’m not sure I’m capable of dealing with both my family and Anna in this suit after last night. “Fine.”,39,"My responsibilities won't let me afford to fall apart now, even though every fiber of my being is screaming for rest and understanding."
“Oh!” Anna jerks a hand over her eyes. “Your Goddamn! Right there!” She turns away. “Sorry! I just—spaced,out—on your—God. And you’re not even harrrrrrr—Fuck me.” She coughs. “Okay. I’ll just meet you down at the restaurant.”,37,"out for a second. I didn't mean to startle you,"" he says, his voice gentle, trying to ease the tension he inadvertently caused."
"I can feel Anna’s eyes on the side of my face. This is how it always starts with Alex, and whatever suspicion he has about my marriage will only make it","worse. I know it’s irrational and a remnant of how we used to one-up each other for our dad’s approval when we were kids, but I want to beat him. At everything.",63,"grow stronger. He's like a detective, piecing together fragments of a puzzle that he shouldn't even be interested in. His curiosity, mixed with a hint of concern, is both infuriating and disarming. I can almost hear the questions brewing behind his gaze, questions that I've practiced deflecting for years. Yet, despite my readiness to confront his inquiries, there's a part of me that wonders if he's onto something, if the facade I've maintained for so long might finally crumble under his scrutiny. The tension in the room thickens as I prepare to engage in the dance of deception and truth, a dance I've grown all too familiar with."
"Anna slams the brakes on this line of thinking by putting an arm around my back, resting the other hand on my stomach","and gently scratching, just like she unconsciously did last night. I work to suppress a shiver. Turning, she looks at him over her shoulder.",47,"and gently squeezing, a silent promise of protection and support. Her eyes, filled with concern and a hint of fear, meet mine, conveying more than words ever could. ""We need to figure this out together,"" she whispers, her voice steady but betraying the turmoil within. ""Whatever it is, we'll face it head-on."" Her presence alone is a balm to my racing heart, reminding me that even in the darkest times, love and friendship are the anchors that keep us grounded. We sit in silence for a moment, the car's engine humming softly in the background, as we gather our thoughts and muster the courage to confront the unknown challenges ahead."
"Eko goes through the basics of paddling, giving us tips about what areas of the",reef to avoid as we approach. “Is everyone comfortable with the basics of kayaking?” she asks.,31,"boat to grip, how to position our bodies for balance, and the importance of maintaining a steady rhythm in our strokes. He emphasizes the need to stay calm and focused, reminding us that even the slightest panic can disrupt our balance and control. As we practice, he circles around us, offering encouragement and corrections, making sure we understand the nuances of each movement. He explains how reading the water and the wind can give us an edge, allowing us to navigate more efficiently and safely. Eko's passion for the sport is infectious, and his patience in teaching us is evident. He believes that mastering the basics is crucial before attempting more complex maneuvers, ensuring that we have a solid foundation to build upon. By the end of the session, we feel more confident and equipped with the knowledge to improve our paddling skills significantly."
"I reach back, pulling my T-shirt up and off, tossing it to the side. Alex hesitates and","then does the same, his expression turning homicidal when I smirk down at his soft little paunch.",34,"finally speaks, ""Are you sure about this? It's a bit sudden, don't you think?"""
"Alex snorts, looking at her derisively, like she’s an idiot. In a hot","flush, my hackles are up, and every rational thought goes out the window.",26,uninformed child who doesn't understand the complexities of real life and relationships.
"“Course you are, sweetheart,” I say, steadying my voice and looking down at Anna.",“I went running without you this morning and you really let me have it.”,28,"“You're my little fighter,” I add, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder, hoping to convey strength and unwavering support."
"“We work out together every morning.” I’m speaking to Alex but holding Anna’s gaze. Maybe it’s the pent-up frustration from last night, or maybe my brother just","brings out the worst in me and the best way to drag him is through his wife’s dissatisfaction, but I keep going. “Gets the blood flowing, doesn’t it?”",55,"it's just the way he talks about her, like she's some kind of trophy he's showing off, not a person. ""Yeah, well, at least someone here is getting some exercise,"" I snap back, trying to mask my irritation with a smirk. Anna rolls her eyes, but there's a hint of amusement in them, suggesting she's used to this dynamic. ""You know, you could join us,"" Alex suggests, his tone light but his eyes serious, as if he's probing for a reaction. ""I mean, it's not like you're doing much sitting around anyway."" His words hang in the air, a challenge and an invitation all at once, leaving me with a choice to either rise to the bait or consider his offer."
"And that much is immediately apparent. She trips as she tries to climb in. I hold the boat steady for her, but she still ends up getting","in backward and then having to awkwardly turn around in the tiny space. I pretend to scratch my shoulder with my chin, glancing behind us. Fuck. Alex noticed.",55,"immersed in the water, her dress clinging to her, revealing more than she likely intended. Her face flushes with embarrassment and frustration, but she manages a small, determined smile as she clambers back into the boat. ""Thank you,"" she says, her voice a mix of gratitude and an underlying resolve. I nod, offering a reassuring smile, and help her settle more comfortably. ""We'll get you across safely,"" I assure her, my words meant to bolster her spirits. As we push off from the bank again, I keep a firm grip on the oars, ready to steady us against any further mishaps. Our journey across the water is fraught with minor challenges, but together, we navigate them, each small victory strengthening the bond between us. By the time we reach the other side, she's not just a passenger; she's a companion, her initial hesitance replaced with a newfound confidence. The experience has taught us both about resilience and the power of support in overcoming obstacles."
"Just then, Anna looks over and lets out a high-pitched shriek. “West! A sea turtle!” She","leans to the side, and her oar slides off her lap and into the clear water.",32,"quickly grabs her camera, rushing towards the shore, her heart pounding with excitement and the thrill of capturing such a rare moment on film. West, ever the patient companion, follows at a distance, curious about the commotion but understanding the importance of Anna's pursuit. As they reach the water's edge, Anna's eyes scan the surf, searching for the elusive creature. Suddenly, a dark shape emerges, and with a burst of energy, the sea turtle flaps its flippers and pulls itself onto the sand. Anna snaps a series of photos, her hands steady despite the adrenaline coursing through her veins. West sits nearby, watching the turtle with a mixture of awe and curiosity, his tail wagging gently. The turtle, seemingly unbothered by the human presence, begins to make its way back to the water, leaving a trail of wet sand behind. Anna and West stand in silence, the only sound the gentle lapping of the waves against the shore, each lost in their own thoughts about the incredible encounter they've just witnessed."
"“He and I have never been close,” I say quickly, suddenly and deeply uninterested in spending the morning anywhere but right","here with Anna. “I think from the moment he was born, the only thing he cared about was impressing our father.”",42,"else but right here, in this familiar, quiet room. The thought of his laughter, his boisterous energy, feels like a foreign invasion, something I want nothing to do with. My heart beats rapidly, not from excitement, but from a strange, unsettling sense of detachment. I wonder if this is what indifference feels like, this sudden, sharp disconnection from someone who was once a constant in my life. I glance around the room, taking in the familiar sights and sounds, seeking comfort in the mundane. The morning light filters through the curtains, casting a soft glow that seems to emphasize the solitude I've chosen. I realize, with a pang of something akin to regret, that this distance might be permanent, a new normal that I'll have to adjust to. Yet, there's a part of me that's relieved, a part that's eager to explore this newfound freedom from obligation and expectation. As I sit there, the silence becomes a companion, and I'm left to ponder the complexities of human relationships and the unexpected turns they can take."
“You drive Alex crazy because he can’t ever beat you even though he’s the older,brother. He’s probably jealous because you’re tall and hot and smart and he’s short and—”,30,"brother,” she teased, her eyes twinkling with mischief. “But don't worry, I'll let you win sometimes just for old times' sake,” she added with a playful wink, knowing full well that Alex would never admit defeat so easily."
"Anna pulls her hand from the water and sends it absently down her stomach, leaving a trail of water that quickly pulls",into droplets and evaporates in the heat. “Is it weird that we lived together for two years and you don’t remember this?”,44,"dry, creating a peculiar sensation on her skin. She stares at the droplets, her mind wandering to the unpredictability of life, much like how water can suddenly vanish, leaving nothing but the memory of its presence. The droplets remind her of tears, both hers and those she's witnessed, each one a testament to emotions too complex to be contained by mere liquid. She wonders if the world is similar, a vast ocean where feelings and experiences evaporate into the air, leaving behind only the echo of their existence. Anna's contemplation deepens, pondering the transient nature of everything, including love and pain, which seem to ebb away just as quickly as the water from her hand."
"Gingerly, Anna lifts the ice, gasping at the small wound there.","She sets the ice back down, flushed, and nods decisively. “You’ll live.”",23,"She examines it closely, her heart racing with a mix of fear and relief, realizing it's not as bad as it could have been."
"Anna scowls at him, and with the circle of people watching, crouches down, setting","two fingers on his leg. She immediately jerks her arm back. “Wow, it’s hot.”",28,"her hand on the dog's head, whispering something into its ear, as if trying to reassure both the animal and herself in the midst of the crowd's judgmental gaze."
"Anna laughs. “Well, technically the twelfth, but the fifth was when he wrote me a song and got on his knees to","sing it to me, so that’s the night I see as our actual marriage.” She looks up at me, eyes soft. “He cried.”",45,"pro propose, which was both incredibly sweet and utterly embarrassing, especially since it happened in front of his entire family during a holiday gathering. Ever since then, he's been a bit over the top with his romantic gestures, trying to live up to that moment, which has led to a series of both endearing and awkward situations. Despite the occasional cringe-worthy display, Anna can't help but feel a deep affection for him, knowing that he's willing to go to such lengths to express his feelings. Their relationship, though not without its challenges, is built on a foundation of genuine care and a shared sense of humor about their quirks."

"But because this is a Weston Party™, it doesn’t end there. Clustered down the center of each table are vases bursting with white orchids and sprays of spiky green palms. The plates are bone china, and they look old, rich old, vintage, with","about seventeen matching smaller plates and crystal champagne flutes at each place setting. I wonder idly if Janet had these brought over from her own collection, and then I realize she’d be more likely to just buy an entirely new set of priceless china.",87,"ornate patterns that seem to tell stories of their own.

The room's atmosphere thickened, each person present absorbing the gravity of his unspoken words, their expressions a mix of confusion and concern.

"“I was only fifteen when Grandpa died. We were all at the reading of the will, but you can imagine in a situation like that, especially for kids, a lot of the details sort of go over your head. The reading took hours. I understood,","basically, that he was leaving us each a very large sum of money. I understood that it was contingent on us being married.
