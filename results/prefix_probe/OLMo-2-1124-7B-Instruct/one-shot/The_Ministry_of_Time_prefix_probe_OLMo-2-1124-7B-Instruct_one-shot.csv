"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking. Lacerations too, from a Taser—he’d shot at two of the team members who’d come to expatriate him, and a third was forced to fire.",103,
"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into","his eighties. As it was, he was thirty-seven years old and had not experienced crinolines, A Tale of Two Cities, or the enfranchisement of the working classes.",53,"the era. It was a modest structure, with a front garden that had seen better days, the hedges overgrown and the path cracked and uneven. The house itself had a sagging porch, where the paint was peeling to reveal the underlying red brick, and the windows, though large, were grimy and needed cleaning. The interior was equally unassuming, with heavy wooden beams supporting the ceiling of the main hall, which was adorned with a dusty chandelier that had seen more prosperous times. The kitchen was small and functional, with a large wooden table that served as both a dining area and a workspace. The living room, though spacious, was cluttered with mismatched furniture and outdated decor, giving off an air of neglect. Despite its apparent dilapidation, the house held a certain charm, with its original features still intact, telling a story of a bygone era."
“Mm. Beside your elbow is a white box with a handle. It’s a refrigerator—a,"fridge, we call it. Could you open the door and take out the milk, please?”",29,"device used to store perishable foods at low temperatures, preventing bacterial growth and spoilage, thus keeping the contents fresh for longer periods."
"Gore was already fully dressed and sitting on the edge of the bath, smoking. The bottom of the bath",had a low-tide mark of cigarette ash and soap scum. Two cigarettes were crushed out in the soap dish.,38,"was filled with water, which he had evidently been using to wash himself. The room was dimly lit, casting long shadows across the walls, and the air was thick with the scent of tobacco, mingling with the more clinical, antiseptic smell of the medical facility. Gore looked up as Pendergast entered, his expression unreadable in the dim light. His hands, though trembling slightly, were steady enough as he took another drag from his cigarette, exhaling the smoke slowly. ""I trust you've come with good news, Agent Pendergast,"" Gore said, his voice a low rumble, betraying none of the tension that might have been expected under the circumstances. ""I've been expecting you."" Pendergast, ever the picture of calm, nodded. ""I believe we have a lead on the identity of the perpetrator,"" he replied, his eyes scanning the room, taking in every detail. ""And we have reason to believe that this individual may be planning another attack."" Gore's eyes narrowed, his interest piqued. ""Another attack?"" he echoed, his tone laced with a mix of curiosity and concern. ""Yes,"" Pendergast continued, ""and we believe it could be imminent. Your expertise in forensic psychology is exactly what we need to anticipate and prevent it."" Gore considered this for a moment, the flickering light casting shifting shadows across his face. ""Very well,"" he finally said, rising from the bath with a grace that belied his age. ""Let's get to work then."" The two men, each a master of their respective fields, began to collaborate, their minds sharp and focused, driven by a shared purpose to stop a potential catastrophe before it could unfold."
"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale. A vile smell was seeping up from the floor.",39,"whole room seemed to be drowning in crimson, the color of the freshly spilled blood that trickled from the pipe onto the already stained floor. Gore, with his typically stoic demeanor, showed a rare flicker of concern as he hastily tried to stem the flow with whatever makeshift solution he could conjure. His usual calm was disrupted, revealing a glimpse of the chaos that was about to unfold. The water-supply line, a fragile lifeline in the midst of impending disaster, continued to spew blood-red liquid, a stark and horrifying symbol of the violence to come."
"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer. I’m sure he knew plenty about ship’s rigging, but he’d probably never handled an instrument more technologically complex than a sextant. Men in their right minds are","not usually overcome with a mania for pulling the plumbing apart. I suggested he might like to wash his hands at the sink downstairs, and I could, perhaps, call a plumber, and we could, potentially, take a constitutional walk on the nearby heath.",85,"unlikely to volunteer for the kind of work that requires a deep understanding of steam engines and the intricacies of coal-fired boilers. Yet, as the world transitioned from the canvas of the open sea to the ironclad battleships of the Industrial Age, men like Gore found themselves thrust into roles that demanded a blend of old-world naval tactics and new-world technological acumen. Despite his lack of formal training in engineering, Gore's experience navigating the unpredictable waters of the Atlantic and his keen observational skills could have been invaluable assets in the complex and often chaotic environment of a naval vessel during the American Civil War. He would have had to quickly adapt, learning the ropes of steam propulsion, understanding the nuances of boiler pressure, and mastering the art of coal logistics—all while maintaining the discipline and leadership expected of an officer. His ability to command respect and inspire his crew would have been as crucial as his technical knowledge, ensuring that the ship operated at peak efficiency and that the men under his command remained loyal and effective in the face of battle. In the heat of conflict, Gore's decisions could mean the difference between victory and defeat, making his role far more than just that of a figurehead officer; he would have been a linchpin in the operational success of the Union's naval efforts."
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people. Hunting was out of the question, and socializing was limited by order of the Ministry. By the end of the first week he was visibly going bonkers with no one but me to talk to.",79,"reading. These hobbies were not mere pastimes for him; they were expressions of his deep-seated nature. He approached each with the same meticulous care and dedication he applied to his political career, ensuring he was always improving and never merely going through the motions. His ability to immerse himself fully in these activities was something I found both admirable and slightly intimidating. It made me question how I pursued my own interests, whether I was as committed as he was. Gore's life was a testament to the idea that one's passions, when pursued with genuine enthusiasm and effort, could lead to a life of remarkable fulfillment and authenticity. His ability to balance these various aspects of his life without letting them interfere with his responsibilities was another lesson in discipline and prioritization. As I spent more time with him, I began to understand that his approach to life was not just about the individual hobbies but about a philosophy of living that valued depth, quality, and genuine engagement with the world. This realization profoundly influenced my own outlook, encouraging me to reassess my priorities and strive for a life that is as rich and multifaceted as his."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea. He told me stories as if he were trying to catch himself in amber. Just like my mother, though I didn’t tell him that.",105,"the changes occurring in the bustling cities. His mind, steeped in the past, could not reconcile the rapid advancements of technology and societal norms. The industrial revolution, with its steam engines and factories, would have seemed like a fantastical dream to him. The horse-drawn carriages would have been replaced by automobiles, their internal combustion engines roaring through the streets, leaving trails of smoke in their wake. The once clear skies of his time would now be obscured by the smog of progress, a stark contrast to the open seas he so often gazed upon. The telegraph, with its ability to send messages instantaneously across vast distances, would have been a marvel, yet also a source of bewilderment. The telephone, with its voice carried through wires, would have been utterly foreign. The photographs, capturing moments in time with precision, would have been a revelation, replacing the paintings and sketches of yesteryears. The advancements in medicine, with vaccines and antibiotics, would have saved countless lives, yet also introduced new fears of contagion and the unknown. The political landscape, with its shifting alliances and the rise of nationalism, would have been as tumultuous as the seas he navigated. The abolition of slavery, the women's suffrage movement, and the gradual erosion of class distinctions would have been signs of a world in constant, sometimes violent, transformation. The arts, with their exploration of human emotion and experience, would have evolved, reflecting the inner turmoil and triumphs of a society in flux. And yet, despite the overwhelming changes, there would have been constants: the sun rising and setting, the pull of the tides, and the enduring human capacity for love, loss, and resilience. Gore, in his displaced time, would have been a silent observer, a man out of time, forever anchored to an era that had long since passed."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake. Another person’s unguardedness in that moment can be very useful, interpersonally, as long as you don’t soften. There is language I could use about this if I were the melodramatic type: behind enemy lines, for example, or double agent. My sister might use these terms, or she might call me a fraud.",119,"he inevitably would, I hoped it wouldn't shatter his perception of me irreparably. I had grown fond of the image I projected, the respect it garnered from those around me. Yet, the thought of revealing my deception gnawed at me, a constant reminder of the web of lies I wove. It was a delicate balance, maintaining the illusion while grappling with the moral implications of my actions. I feared that once the mask fell, the person beneath might not be as admirable, or even as likable, as the one people had come to know. The truth, once out, could not be taken back, and I wasn't sure if I was prepared for the consequences of my deception being unveiled. As I contemplated my next move, I realized that the greatest risk was not in being found out, but in losing myself in the process of maintaining the facade."
Gore lifts his hand. He’s left a smear on the table the color of tamarind flesh.,"There is a sour, steady pain in his palm that he briefly misunderstands as a taste.",32,"His fingers, stained with the evidence, tremble slightly as he lowers them, revealing the crimson mark on the polished wood, a testament to the violence that had just transpired."
"Gore considers the weight of the sack he’d carried, which had felt so meaningful. “Three partridges,”","he says, “and a boatswain gull too far off to hit. Nothing else. Not even tracks.”",32,"he muttered to himself, a small victory in a world that had seemed increasingly barren and devoid of purpose."
"At this, Stanley leans in. He is a fussy, short-tempered, handsome man who does not enjoy his job. “I must impress upon",the meeting that the debility that wracks those in the sick bay will doubtless find ample footholds should we reduce the men’s rations.”,45,"you the importance of this task,” he says, his voice barely above a whisper, betraying his frustration. “This is not just about paperwork; it's about ensuring the safety and security of our operations. We cannot afford any slip-ups, not with the kind of stakes involved. You will need to work late tonight, review every detail, and prepare a comprehensive report by morning. I expect nothing less than your absolute best.”"
"Gore is looking at his left palm. The sour pain is still there, seeping","through the bandages. So is the blood, but it seems melodramatic to observe this.",28,"into his consciousness, a reminder of the accident that had irrevocably altered his life just hours ago."
The ice outside shifts—the Arctic stammering its jaws as a cat does when it sees a bird. The ship’s cat died in convulsions during,"their second winter. Gore had liked that cat. He’d become quite attached to it, especially as his dog had died in the first spring.",48,"its futile pursuit through the storm-tossed deck, its fur matted with salt and its eyes wide with the terror of the endless white wilderness it could never conquer. Now, the ship itself seems to mimic the feline's final moments, shuddering and trembling as if it too were alive, haunted by the ghost of the creature it once sheltered. The crew, wrapped in layers of oilskins and wool, moves with a grim determination, their faces etched with the resolve to press on despite the merciless grip of the elements. The captain, standing tall on the bridge, surveys the churning sea with a steely gaze, his orders barked into the howling gale, commanding the ship to forge ahead. The engines roar in response, a defiant challenge to the storm, as the vessel struggles to maintain its course, a lone warrior in a battle against nature's fury."
"Once we arrived at the Ministry, an escort of subtly armed suits took Gore to meet the other expats. I was expecting he’d","go through a group therapy session, but Gore was in a sunny mood, so he must have been envisaging something closer to a salon.",47,"be overwhelmed with questions about the recent events, but to my surprise, he seemed calm and collected, almost as if he had anticipated this moment. The expats, a diverse group of individuals, gathered in a secure conference room, their faces a mixture of curiosity and concern. Gore, with his usual eloquence, began to speak, outlining the situation back home and the reasons for their unexpected relocation. His words, though carefully chosen, hinted at a deeper turmoil beneath his composed exterior. The room fell silent, each person processing the gravity of the situation. As the meeting progressed, it became clear that this was not just a gathering of displaced individuals but a council of sorts, with each member bringing their unique skills and perspectives to the table. The Ministry, it seemed, had more than just relocation in mind; they were assembling a team to navigate the complex political landscape that had led to this point. My role, as I gathered, was to assist in bridging the gap between the expats and their new environment, leveraging my local knowledge and connections to ensure their integration and effectiveness. The task ahead was daunting, but the sense of purpose and unity in the room gave me hope. Together, we would face the challenges ahead, not just for ourselves but for the broader implications our actions would have on the world."
"“Complex,” said Adela. “Thanks for your input. Given their histories, mental trauma is to be anticipated.

By examining their resilience and coping strategies, we hope to identify universal principles that can be applied to broader contexts, ultimately improving the quality of life for many individuals."
"“We can’t risk the temporal repercussions,” said Adela. “They are supposed to be dead. As long as they’re here, it’s functionally as if they are dead in","their own time.

"We’d arrived in the central lobby. Gore was standing in a shaft of sunlight, staring up",at the steel-and-glass ceiling. He looked dazzled into boyishness by the half sky of the building’s skull.,33,"at the ceiling as if searching for answers among the scattered beams. His face was pale, his eyes wide with a mixture of shock and something else, something more profound, perhaps a realization of the gravity of the situation or the weight of the secrets he carried. His hands, which moments before had been fidgeting nervously, were now clasped tightly together, as if in prayer or to stifle a tremor. The lobby, once a place of mundane arrivals and departures, now seemed to hold its breath, the air thick with anticipation and the unspoken events that had led to this moment. My gaze shifted between Gore and the sunlight, pondering the metaphorical light he was seeking, and the shadows it might reveal."
"We went for lunch at a small bistro near the Ministry. Gore came from an era of service à la française, private dining rooms and putting everything into jelly. When I began to","explain, in tones of motherly patience, how twenty-first-century restaurants operated, he said, “I’ve eaten kangaroo on the uninhabited shores of the Albert River. I understand how a knife and fork work. Please sit down.”",67,"mention the modern shift towards a more informal and flexible dining experience, he seemed somewhat nostalgic. He reminisced about the precision and formality of his time, where each course was meticulously prepared and served with military-like precision. The waitstaff moved with practiced choreography, clearing plates and presenting new ones with an elegance that was almost theatrical. In contrast, the bistro we visited offered a more relaxed atmosphere, with patrons dining at communal tables and servers juggling multiple orders with a casual efficiency. Gore observed the diners' freedom to choose their own pace and order, a concept that, while liberating, lacked the structured elegance he favored. He noted how the simplicity of a dish like coq au vin was elevated by the traditional methods and care, something that seemed to be lost in the rush for innovation and convenience. As we ate, Gore shared stories of grand banquets and the art of presentation, his eyes occasionally wandering to the bustling kitchen, where the modern chefs worked with a speed and energy that belied the meticulousness of their craft. Despite the differences, he found a certain charm in the new ways, appreciating the adaptability and creativity they represented. Yet, there was a wistful note in his voice, a longing for the days when dining was an event, a performance, and not merely sustenance for the busy day."
"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to",take us to”—here he raised his eyebrows—“a public house. I am looking forward to seeing what visions of sin this era has concocted for the humble tavern.”,53,"be rebuilt, and I told him I'd help him in any way I could. Little did I know how much that would involve,"" Gore concluded, a hint of regret lacing his voice."
"Back at the house I was still struggling to think of as “home,” Gore shyly asked me if I would also “come for a drink.” He had done well, at lunch, to hide his deep embarrassment over my payment",of the bill (with a Ministry expense card); he was adjusting with gold-star alacrity in recognizing that it wouldn’t be a reputation-detonating act for a respectable woman to be seen in a public house in the company of bachelors.,78,"of the check. His cheeks had flushed a deep crimson, and I could tell it took a great effort for him to maintain his composure. Now, in the privacy of his living room, he seemed to relax slightly, though his hands still fidgeted nervously on the arms of his chair. I nodded, accepting his invitation, and he let out a breath he seemed to have been holding. ""I'm not much of a host,"" he began, his voice tinged with a hint of melancholy, ""but I thought maybe we could talk over a drink. Just you and me."" He gestured vaguely towards the small bar area, where a bottle of whiskey and two glasses sat waiting. ""I've been meaning to clear out some of this stuff,"" he continued, his eyes not meeting mine, ""but it's hard to let go of things, isn't it? Memories, I mean. They stick around, even when you wish they wouldn't."" His words seemed to carry a weight, a heaviness that spoke of past regrets and unspoken sorrows. As I settled onto the couch, I realized this drink might be more than just a social nicety; it was an opportunity to connect on a level deeper than polite conversation. I nodded again, signaling my understanding and agreement to his unspoken terms. ""I'm glad you're here,"" Gore said softly, pouring us each a drink. ""Let's make a toast,"" he proposed, lifting his glass. ""To new beginnings,"" he said, his voice steady now. I clinked my glass against his, feeling a sense of camaraderie and anticipation for the conversation to come."
"I coughed at my half-pint. Ralph, a snide and etiolated former field agent, was my",least favorite bridge. He had somehow managed to get assigned the only young woman expat.,30,"partner in crime, stood beside me, his pale hands clasped behind his back, his eyes scanning the dimly lit bar with a practiced, yet weary, scrutiny. He had been through the wringer, a man who'd seen too much, and his demeanor reflected a soul that had been stretched thin by the weight of his past. His once sharp features now bore the lines of countless sleepless nights and the kind of quiet desperation that comes from living in the shadows, always one step ahead of those who sought to drag him back into the fray. I knew that look all too well; it mirrored my own. We were two ghosts in search of redemption, or perhaps just a fleeting moment of peace in a world that never seemed to offer either. As I took another sip of my drink, I couldn't help but wonder if this night would lead us closer to finding it, or just deeper into the abyss."
“No. Apparently it was very awkward when Ralph came in here for a lunchtime gallon of merlot and spotted him. He’s part of Defence’s tracking,team. You know they don’t much like the fact that the Ministry is a separate institution. They thought the time-door ought to fall under their remit.”,51,"unit, and seeing his old boss in such a vulnerable position was more than he could handle. It's become the talk of the office, with everyone speculating about the nature of their relationship and what this incident implies about their past interactions and current dynamics within the department. The incident has also sparked a debate about office privacy and the unexpected encounters that can occur when personal and professional spheres overlap in such confined spaces. Some argue that it highlights the need for more stringent policies regarding visitor access during lunch hours, while others see it as a humorous anecdote that lightens the otherwise tense atmosphere of the office. Regardless, it's clear that this encounter has left a lasting impression on everyone involved and has inadvertently become a case study in workplace etiquette and the complexities of human relationships within a professional setting."

How’s your expat managing the news of your miscegenation?”",34,"malice,” I explained, hoping to mitigate any potential offense, “but it's important to be mindful of the language we use today.”"
I choked. “Uh. We don’t use that word anymore. We just say,"‘Black.’ As an adjective. You would say, ‘She is a Black woman.’ ”",25,"politically incorrect.” My voice sounded strained, as if I was trying to swallow the word itself."
"Graham used other words too, not wrong, exactly, but not right, like “your people,” or “your culture.” When I said, in a wincingly tight voice, that we had the same people and culture, he replied, mildly, “But I don’t think that we do.” Then came the image searches about Cambodia, on food and dress","and customs. I had to do those for him, in the early days, because he still didn’t know how, and the English-language internet was not on my side. Exotic, friendly, conservative, resilient. The way he couched his questions, too, was imperfect. I had to correct “ancestor” for “grandparent,” “sacred” for “polite,” “tribal leaders” for “farmers.”",109,
"He smiled, dimples curving. “I think, as we are ‘housemates,’","and also, I hope, friends, that you should call me Graham.”",21,we should introduce ourselves properly and establish some ground rules for our shared living space to ensure harmony and respect for each other's boundaries and privacy.
"“After you returned home yesterday, the Brigadier came back to see Arthur. They had a conversation","about television, which Arthur seems to think is a wonderful invention. The Brigadier mentioned ‘Auntie’s output.’ ”",33,"that seemed to last for quite some time. The Brigadier left without saying much about what was discussed, but Arthur appeared thoughtful and somewhat troubled afterward. He spent the evening in his room, poring over old letters and photographs, his expression shifting from one of nostalgia to deep concern. Later, when you tried to engage him in conversation, he was distant, his mind clearly elsewhere. This unusual behavior piqued your curiosity, leading you to wonder about the nature of the Brigadier's visit and its impact on Arthur."
"This old wound, formerly healed, he’d received in Australia with Captain Stokes. A gun had exploded in his hands. They were rowing up a river in the captain’s gig, charting its","course. The cockatoos they’d spotted on the opposite bank were so dense as to be cloudlike, billowing from tree to tree. He’d taken up his fowling piece and sighted along the barrel.",63,"banks for the Royal Navy. The explosion had torn through his hand, shattering his thumb and mangling his fingers. The pain was excruciating, but the crew managed to get him ashore to a makeshift hospital. The injury had been severe enough to warrant amputation, but the medical facilities were rudimentary, and the operation was botched. The result was a festering wound that refused to heal properly. Despite the primitive conditions, the ship's surgeon, a man named Dr. Livesey, took a personal interest in his recovery. He cleaned the wound obsessively, applying poultices and ointments, and insisted on a regimen of rest and strict confinement to prevent infection. Yet, the wound remained stubbornly inflamed, and the constant pain became a part of the sailor's life. The man, whose name was Tom, grew increasingly despondent as the months passed without significant improvement. His spirits lifted only slightly when Captain Stokes, recognizing the toll the injury was taking on his crewman, arranged for a transfer back to England. The voyage home was long and uncomfortable, with Tom confined to his hammock, his bandaged hand a constant reminder of the accident. Upon arrival in Portsmouth, Tom was immediately taken to the naval hospital, where he hoped for better care. However, the medical standards of the time were not advanced enough to provide the kind of treatment that could fully mend his damaged hand. Instead, Tom endured more surgeries and treatments, each one bringing temporary relief at best. The psychological impact of his injury was profound, leaving him with bouts of depression and anxiety. He found solace in the company of fellow sailors who had suffered their own injuries, forming a bond that helped him cope with his new reality. Eventually, Tom was deemed well enough to return to active duty, though his hand would never fully function as it once did. He adapted, learning to perform his duties with his remaining fingers, a testament to his resilience. The old wound, though never fully healed in the traditional sense, became a symbol of his survival and adaptability, a reminder of the harsh realities of naval life in the 19th century."
"It’s surprising, then, that I allowed Graham’s drawing of the projection device to enter my files as a joke, like a coin minted 70 BC. I thought it was a form of juvenilia, drawn in","his earliest years as a modern man, something to remind him of on a significant anniversary of his arrival here; and not, as it would turn out to be, a red letter from another era.",70,"the whimsical spirit of a bored afternoon. Little did I know that this seemingly trivial piece of art would become the cornerstone of our latest breakthrough in quantum computing. The device, as absurd as it appeared, contained within its lines a concept so revolutionary that it redefined our understanding of data processing. As I delved deeper into the intricacies of Graham's sketch, I realized that the antiquated design held within it the blueprint for a quantum gate, a key component that had eluded scientists for decades. The realization hit me with the force of a tidal wave, altering the course of my career and the trajectory of our research. The drawing, with its archaic charm, concealed a future that was both unexpected and groundbreaking. It was a testament to the fact that sometimes, the most profound insights come from the most unlikely sources. As we began to develop the actual device based on Graham's drawing, skepticism was met with awe as the theoretical became tangible. The device, once a laughingstock, stood as a beacon of innovation, proving that even in the most serious of scientific endeavors, there is room for humor and serendipity."
"By the start of that summer, Graham was practically a native of the era. He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle. Most mornings he rose—hours before me—and",went for a run. He would sometimes wake me up with a juicy smoker’s wheeze on his return to the house. He started giving me custody of his cigarettes and enforced a predinner smoking ban.,70,"spent time on his porch, watching the sun rise over the sleepy town. He had a ritual of sipping coffee from a chipped mug, the handle taped with duct tape, while the world around him slowly stirred to life. His neighbors, initially wary of the stranger who had appeared out of nowhere, began to warm up to him. They saw him tending his garden, waving politely as they passed by, and eventually, he was invited to various community gatherings. Graham's presence became a comforting constant in the lives of those around him, a reminder that change, though sometimes abrupt and unexpected, could bring about a sense of belonging and community. His transformation from a stranger to a cherished fixture of the neighborhood was a testament to the human capacity for adaptation and connection."
"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past. I was prickly and defensive about","this; I could not look at why directly. I heard the way I spoke to him about it: adjustment, reasonable, citizen, responsibility, values. He blew a lot of pensive cigarette smoke at me.",65,"his heritage, insisting that clinging to old ways was not a sign of stubbornness but a testament to his identity. I tried to explain that progress wasn't about forgetting where you came from but about evolving, embracing change while holding onto the values that defined who we were. Yet, Graham saw the modern world as a relentless force eroding the essence of what he held dear, and I struggled to bridge the gap between his nostalgia and my vision of a future enriched by diversity and innovation. Our conversations often circled back to this theme, with Graham expressing a deep-seated fear that the rapid changes sweeping through society would strip away the very fabric of his being. He spoke of traditions lost to time, of languages fading into obscurity, and of customs that were no longer observed, leaving him feeling adrift in a sea of unfamiliarity. I, on the other hand, argued that while some aspects of the past might be irreplaceable, the beauty of humanity lay in our ability to adapt and grow, to learn from history without being its prisoner. Despite our differing views, I admired Graham's unwavering commitment to his beliefs and his determination to preserve what he considered the soul of his culture. In him, I saw a man grappling with the inevitable passage of time, fighting to keep his past alive in a world that often seemed indifferent to its value. Our exchanges were a poignant reminder of the delicate balance between honoring one's roots and moving forward, a balance that each generation must navigate as it charts its course through the ever-changing landscape of human existence."
"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them. Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled","to focus on the tests—eyes moving rapidly. I once found him the sole occupant of the fifth-floor smoking area (a pigeon-shit-encrusted balcony), methodically shredding a filter of a finished cigarette. I watched him for a while, interested in the way that only his fingers moved. Most people ripple with surplus motion unless they are concentrating, but Graham only ever moved the parts of him that he wanted to move.",137,"to pace back and forth, muttering about the absurdity of it all. The researchers, initially perplexed, soon realized that the association with the hospital environment was too strong and potentially contaminating the results. Consequently, the tests were moved to a more neutral setting—a nondescript room on the second floor of the building. This change helped somewhat, but the psychological toll remained high. Participants were still unnerved by the unpredictability of the tests and the invasive nature of the stimuli they were subjected to. Some expats began to exhibit signs of stress-related disorders, such as insomnia and heightened startle responses. In an attempt to mitigate these effects, the researchers introduced a debriefing session after each test, providing participants with information about the purpose and expected outcomes of the study. This measure, while well-intentioned, did little to alleviate the deep-seated unease many expats felt about being used as guinea pigs in a psychological experiment. The ethical implications of the study were increasingly scrutinized, leading to debates within the research team about the necessity of the experiments and the potential harm being done to the participants. As the study progressed, the researchers found themselves questioning the very objectives they had set out to achieve, caught in a moral quandary between scientific curiosity and the well-being of their subjects."
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too. Even Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had","fought in large-scale battles, were laid out by the ultramodern scope of the harm. They began to resist the exams psychologically, spoiling our hard-won data. It was agreed that we’d delay introducing them to Hiroshima, Auschwitz, and the Twin Towers. Control promised to provide a timeline for the revelations, but it hadn’t materialized.",105,"seen their fair share of conflict, found the images deeply disturbing. The test was defended by some as a means to understand the psychological impact of war, but others criticized it for its potential to traumatize subjects unnecessarily. The debate raged on within the small community of expatriates, reflecting a broader societal struggle with the ethics of psychological experimentation. Meanwhile, Nineteen-sixteen, despite his sedation, began to articulate a poignant critique of the test, questioning the value of inflicting emotional distress in the pursuit of knowledge. This sparked a deeper conversation about the responsibilities of researchers and the inherent risks involved in exploring the human psyche. The incident also led to more stringent ethical guidelines being proposed for future psychological experiments, emphasizing informed consent and the protection of subjects from undue harm. As the expatriates navigated these complex issues, they found themselves not only grappling with the challenges of their new environment but also reflecting on the broader implications of their work and its impact on individuals and society."
"Adela was always present at the honesty exams, often intervening in them. I got the impression that she was listening to offstage prompts that only she could","hear, being the only one among us who was aware she was on a stage, and was trying to chivvy us along the right course of action.",54,"hear. Her actions seemed rehearsed, as if she were reading from a script that guided her responses to steer the outcomes in a particular direction. It was peculiar and somewhat suspicious, leading me to wonder about the integrity of these exams and the role Adela played in them. Was she genuinely helping the candidates, or was there a hidden agenda? Perhaps she was ensuring certain individuals passed or failed based on criteria that went beyond mere honesty. The more I observed, the more convinced I became that there was a complex web of influence and manipulation at play, with Adela at its center. Her presence seemed to cast a shadow over the entire process, raising questions about the fairness and transparency of the exams."
"Adela smiled with about a third of her mouth. Her face had changed again. She looked pinched and hungry,",and hauntingly as if her skin was held in place by a bulldog clip at the back of her skull.,39,"as if the joy she had felt moments before had been replaced by a gnawing emptiness that no feast could satisfy. Her eyes, once bright with anticipation, now held a shadow of something lost, something that perhaps only she could understand or reclaim. The room, once filled with the warmth of companionship, seemed to grow colder, as if the very air around her had turned against her, whispering secrets she was not meant to hear. Adela's smile faltered, her hand reaching unconsciously to her throat, as if to soothe the ache that had suddenly manifested there, a physical reminder of an emotional turmoil she could not yet name."
"I went along to one of the earliest dinners, chicken bag slung over my shoulder. Bridges tended not to eat at the Ministry canteen with administrative staff and the operators on the Wellness team—the office-based employees—and the decorous hostility with which the paper pushers met me was adorable. When I got to the","kitchen itself, the first thing I saw was Graham leaning down to light a cigarette on the gas ring, his curls dangerously close to the hob. We’d had to disable smoke detectors in every Ministry room that Graham used. If he couldn’t have a cigarette, he’d throw whatever experiment he was strapped into.",106,"room, I was greeted with a mixture of curiosity and thinly veiled disdain. The staff seemed unsure how to react to my presence, a stark contrast to the usual clientele. I found a seat at the far end of the dining area, away from the clusters of colleagues engaged in their polite banter and the occasional clinking of cutlery against china. The chicken bag, a humble brown paper parcel tied with string, sat on my lap, drawing a few raised eyebrows and whispers that I could hear even over the murmur of conversation. I smiled to myself, unfazed, and began to unpack my meal. The aroma of roasted chicken, spices, and fresh herbs quickly filled the space, causing a few heads to turn in my direction. Some expressions softened, perhaps intrigued by the unfamiliar scent, or maybe reminded of home-cooked meals. I carved a piece of chicken and took a bite, savoring the flavors that were a comforting reminder of simpler times. The staff, initially hesitant, began to approach, curious about the meal and where I had acquired such a delicacy. I shared a few bites with those who dared to come closer, and to my surprise, the ice began to thaw. Conversations started to flow more freely, and soon, I was engaged in discussions about food, travel, and the occasional work-related anecdote. By the end of the meal, the earlier hostility had transformed into a warm camaraderie, all thanks to the simple act of sharing food. It was a poignant reminder of how something as basic as a meal could bridge gaps and foster connections among people who, on the surface, had little in common. As I left the dining area, I felt a sense of accomplishment and a renewed appreciation for the power of food to unite and heal. The experience was a testament to the idea that sometimes, the most profound interactions can stem from the most unexpected and humble beginnings."
"She put a glass down in front of me—ice, water, an oily suggestion of cordial, and,","sure enough, some fussy edible garnishes. I blinked at it and then at Margaret, who smiled.",32,"as she watched my face, a flicker of something unreadable passed through her eyes."
"Graham said, “Hm!” and pulled hard on his cigarette. He wandered off with the expansive air of a man who might pick up some parsley, not because",he has been told to but because that might be a jolly thing to do en route to his next footloose and fancy-free destination. I watched him go.,55,"he needed it for dinner, but because he happened to be passing that way and it was there to be picked."" Graham's actions seemed to reflect a man lost in thought, his mind wandering through the corridors of his own introspection, perhaps pondering the triviality of his own pursuits amidst the grandeur of life's complexities. His cigarette, now a mere stub, dangled loosely from his fingers, a symbol of his momentary pause in the relentless march of time. As he walked, the world around him continued its rhythmic dance, indifferent to the musings of a solitary figure meandering through its midst. The sun began its descent, casting long shadows that stretched out like the arms of an embracing giant, welcoming the dusk with a serene quietude. Graham's steps eventually led him to a small, neglected garden at the edge of the property, where a few stubborn flowers clung to life, defiant against the encroaching neglect. He paused, his gaze lingering on a particularly vibrant bloom, its colors a stark contrast to the greys and browns of the fading day. In that moment, the garden seemed to whisper secrets of resilience and beauty, lessons that seemed to resonate with the man's own inner turmoil. With a deep, contemplative breath, he dropped the cigarette to the ground, where it was promptly crushed underfoot, a small act of defiance against the habit that had long held him in its grip. Graham's journey through the garden was not merely a physical one; it was a mental meandering through the landscapes of his soul, a search for meaning and purpose in a world that often seemed devoid of both. As he emerged from the garden, the setting sun casting his silhouette against the horizon, there was a subtle shift in his demeanor—a newfound resolve, a spark of determination. He had picked up something, not parsley, but perhaps a fragment of wisdom, a reminder of the beauty and resilience that could be found even in the most forsaken places. With a renewed sense of purpose, Graham returned to the house, his steps now carrying the weight of his introspective journey, ready to face whatever lay ahead with a clearer perspective."
"“No,” said Margaret. She shrugged at my expression. “An’ I forsake this duty,” she said, “we’ll sicken. Forty-seven",thinks tobacco is an herb. But womenfolk were cordoned at the stove for centuries. The men mun take lessons.”,37,"years of neglect will have taken their toll on our land and our people. We must persevere, for it is our responsibility to the generations that come after us, to ensure they inherit a home that is strong and vibrant, not one wracked by the consequences of our inaction and selfishness."""
The Brigadier drifted closer. He did look hungry. He looked like I did as a student when I ate nothing but buttered,toast and apples. He turned the white of used candlewax when Margaret opened the oven to better squint at her roast potatoes.,44,"white bread and tea, except he was a lot taller and scarier. His uniform was crisp, his boots polished to a shine that could blind you if the sun hit them just right. He approached the table where I sat, his shadow looming over me, making the already cold room feel even chillier. ""Mind if I join you?"" he asked, his voice deep and authoritative, yet oddly polite. I hesitated, my fork frozen midway to my mouth. The other patrons watched with a mix of curiosity and apprehension. ""Go ahead,"" I managed to say, trying to sound more confident than I felt. He sat down, his presence dominating the small space. ""Thank you,"" he said, nodding slightly. ""I'm Brigadier General Hastings, by the way,"" he introduced himself, extending a large, calloused hand. I shook it, feeling the firm grip, a stark contrast to the softness of the bread in my fingers. ""I'm Alex,"" I replied, feeling oddly formal in his presence. ""You look like you've been on the move for a while,"" he observed, his eyes scanning the room before returning to me. ""Something like that,"" I said, not sure how much I wanted to divulge. ""I've been transferred,"" he continued, taking a bite of his own meal, which seemed to be a much more substantial affair than mine. ""Been a long day,"" he added, almost as an afterthought. ""I can imagine,"" I said, trying to sound empathetic. ""You look like you could use some rest,"" he noted, his gaze piercing. ""Yes, I suppose I could,"" I admitted, feeling oddly vulnerable under his scrutiny. ""Well, you should get some,"" he said, standing up abruptly. ""I've kept you long enough."" His departure was as sudden as his arrival, leaving me to finish my meal in the silence that followed, the echoes of his voice lingering in the air. It was a strange encounter, one that left me with more questions than answers, and a peculiar sense of being both observed and understood in a way I hadn't anticipated."
"“ ’Tis all the same to me, sir,” said Margaret, “though I fear",this cod will grow legs and walk afore my ‘colleague’ returns with my parsley.”,27,"she might be branded as a witch, for I have seen no proof of such"
"Because we lived in a government-owned residence, there were also restrictions on how","long we could have the air-conditioning on. Graham picked at this, irritating and irritated.",27,"we could decorate our home, with certain items being prohibited to maintain a uniform appearance for all residents. This meant that our personal touches were limited, and the sense of individuality was somewhat suppressed by the collective nature of our living situation. However, it also fostered a strong sense of community among us, as we often shared ideas and resources to create a comfortable and welcoming environment within the constraints given to us. Despite the restrictions, we found ways to express our personalities through the small freedoms we had, like choosing specific colors for our furniture or arranging our bookshelves in a way that reflected our interests. These small acts of rebellion against the monotony of the regulations brought a sense of camaraderie and understanding among us, as we all navigated the same set of rules and limitations."
"Movement was anathema. I slept, mostly, naked and poaching in my sweat. The water ration forced Graham to switch finally to thirty-second showers. I didn’t see him for the whole of the heat wave.",We left our bedroom doors open with the intention of letting the air circulate—though the air hung like an executed corpse—and said lackluster things about making a salad to each other from our separate cells.,69,"to avoid further depleting the already scarce supply. The silence between us grew heavier each day, a tangible thing that filled the air of our shared apartment. I tried to reach out, leaving notes on the fridge door, suggesting we meet for a walk or a movie, anything to break the monotony and the oppressive stillness. Yet, Graham seemed to retreat further, his responses brief, his door always closed. I began to worry, wondering if he was alright, if the heat wave had taken a toll on his health, or if something deeper was troubling him. My attempts to communicate were met with silence, and I felt a growing sense of isolation. The city buzzed outside our windows, life continuing unabated, while inside our home, a different story unfolded. I contemplated inviting friends over, hoping they might bridge the gap between Graham and me, but hesitated, unsure how he would react. The days blurred into one another, each one a reminder of the chasm that had formed between us. I tried to occupy my mind with work and other distractions, but thoughts of Graham and our shared past lingered, a constant undercurrent. As the weather began to cool, a small glimmer of hope sparked within me. Perhaps the change in seasons would also bring a change in Graham's demeanor, a sign that he was ready to talk. Yet, until then, I remained patient, waiting, hoping that the silence would soon be broken."
"Adela took bridge meetings in a soundproof room deep in the Ministry’s chest. She always arrived first, and we’d find her sitting at the top of",a long table like a mannequin awaiting the gift of demonic possession. But this time I arrived a quarter of an hour early and she wasn’t there.,53,"the table, her eyes fixed on the cards, lost in thought. Her colleagues often remarked on her peculiar habit, attributing it to her intense dedication to her work. Yet, there was something more profound at play, a method to her solitude that only she understood. Each meeting was not merely a game of bridge but a strategic maneuver in a much larger, unseen battle. Her mind, sharp and calculating, saw connections and consequences that others overlooked, positioning her as a key player in the intricate dance of political alliances and rivalries. Adela's solitary sessions were her sanctuary, a place where she could plot her moves without the distractions of office politics or the judgments of her peers. In those quiet moments, surrounded by the silence of the soundproof room, she was at her most powerful, a solitary figure shaping the course of events from behind the scenes."
Adela was standing at the sink and anarchically disobeying the water ration by running her wrists under cold,"water. She looked unwell, but God alone knows how her plastic surgeon thought she was supposed to look.",36,"the tap, her eyes closed, savoring the forbidden luxury of the chilled liquid cascading over her hands. The water, a scarce commodity in these times of drought, was a symbol of rebellion against the austere measures imposed by the government in a futile attempt to conserve this precious resource. Adela's act of defiance was small, yet it resonated with the silent discontent simmering within her and others, a quiet protest against the oppressive restrictions that governed every aspect of their lives. Unbeknownst to her, this seemingly trivial act of running water over her hands would later serve as a catalyst for a larger movement, a collective voice demanding change and a return to a semblance of normalcy. Her actions, though individual, echoed the sentiments of many, encapsulating the broader struggle for freedom and the right to live without constant surveillance and control. As the water flowed, Adela stood there, a figure of quiet rebellion, unaware of the impact her small act of defiance would have on the future of her society."
"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it,","was a mystery. She didn’t enjoy the prestige, as the Secretary did, and she seemed bizarrely overworked for the proxy boss of a project in its pilot stage.",56,"we couldn't fathom, considering her lackluster performance in previous roles and her notorious aversion to hard work. Yet, here she was, standing before us, delivering a lecture on the importance of punctuality and diligence, as if she had been the epitome of these virtues her entire career. Her words, dripping with condescension and thinly veiled contempt, seemed to imply that our very existence was a nuisance to her, that our presence in the room was an affront to her self-proclaimed superiority. She spoke of teamwork as if it were a foreign concept, one she had merely read about in books, never having had the need to practice it herself. Her tone was one of superiority, her body language closed off, and her eyes seemed to scan us not as colleagues but as subjects of a study on human inefficiency. It was as if she believed that by berating us, she could instill in us a sudden epiphany of diligence, as if her disdain was a magic potion that would transform us into model employees overnight. The irony of her speech was not lost on those of us who knew her work history; her tenure had been marked by missed deadlines, half-hearted efforts, and a general air of apathy. Yet, here she was, the self-appointed guardian of time and productivity, lecturing us on the virtues she so conspicuously failed to embody. It was a performance so absurd, so divorced from reality, that it left us in a state of bewildered silence, unsure whether to laugh at the sheer audacity of it all or to feel insulted by the blatant hypocrisy. As she concluded her tirade, Adela walked away, leaving behind a room filled with a mix of bewilderment and suppressed laughter, her back stiff and her head held high, as if she truly believed she had imparted wisdom rather than delivered a performance of comic proportions."
"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had","just discovered that a woman with whom he was spending a lot of time would never be interested in him. I frowned, and he frowned, and we were frowning into our tea.",64,"found something unexpectedly moving in the mundane act of drinking tea. His eyes, a soft blue that seemed to hold a depth of unspoken stories, met mine, and for a moment, we were both suspended in time, connected by a silent understanding that words could not fully convey. It was as if he had seen something in me, a vulnerability or a truth that I usually kept hidden, and in that instant, our usual barriers fell away. He offered a small, almost shy smile, one that suggested he was as surprised by the connection as I was, and I felt a warmth spread through me, a feeling of being seen and accepted for who I truly was. The room, with its worn furniture and the faint smell of old books, seemed to fade into the background, no longer just a space but a backdrop to this unexpected intimacy. I realized then that moments like these, fleeting and fragile, were what made life truly rich and meaningful. As I returned his smile, I knew that this brief encounter would leave a lasting impression on me, a reminder of the beauty found in the simplest of human connections."
"Graham blew smoke out through his nose reflectively. “I see,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s fair to call him ‘grim,’ though you wouldn’t be the","first to say it. He was a severe disciplinarian, it’s true. Held grudges. But he was a very lonely person. Romantic, too, which made his loneliness worse.”",53,first to do so.”
"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders. The bridges kept turning in their core reports, and the experiments kept running. Given how much of our working day the data collection took, we all assumed that the time-travel project was running to the stated purpose. Every day I had to record his heart rate, his blood pressure, his temperature; every day a written record of what he wore, what he ate, how much","exercise he took; every week checking progress against the imaginary benchmarks set by Control, use of phone, use of transport, use of media and the assessment of how harmful or useful each medium was; all the time the corrective tests for vocabulary and habit; novelistic observations on his character and temperament. It seemed that the job continued. I suppose if you switch on your lights and boil your kettle with energy provided by a nuclear power station, you don’t spend much time reflecting on the fact that the atom had originally been split to kill cities.",192,"symptoms he exhibited, and any deviations from his normal behavior. This meticulous documentation was not just a part of my job; it felt like a sacred duty to capture every detail of his transformation. I noticed subtle changes in his demeanor, his speech patterns, and even his handwriting. One afternoon, as I was recording his vitals, I noticed his eyes darting around the room, avoiding my gaze. His skin had a peculiar pallor, and his breaths were shallow and quick. I asked him if he was feeling alright, to which he responded with a forced smile, assuring me that he was fine. Yet, his reassurance did not match the tension in his voice. That evening, after he had retired to his room, I decided to review the previous day's recordings. His heart rate had spiked at odd intervals, and his blood pressure readings were erratic. The notes I had scribbled down seemed to tell a story of someone grappling with an unseen fear or anxiety. The next morning, I brought up my concerns to Adela, but she dismissed them with a wave of her hand, attributing his behavior to stress from the project. I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was profoundly wrong. The data I collected seemed to corroborate my suspicions, yet Adela's authority and the project's secrecy shielded us from any deeper investigation. As the days turned into weeks, the man we were monitoring seemed to be unraveling before our very eyes, but trapped within the confines of our experiment. The ethical implications of our work began to weigh heavily on me, and I found myself questioning the very foundation of our research. Was the pursuit of knowledge at any cost justifiable? Or were we inadvertently causing harm to a person, perhaps irreparable harm? These questions gnawed at me, but the answers were shrouded in the same secrecy that surrounded the project. I continued to document, to observe, and to silently pray that the truth would reveal itself before it was too late."
"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events. He’d lain motionless in the garden for two hours, on","a wet and putrid night, to shoot a fox, and pulled out one of his own rotting teeth (he showed it to me afterward; it was the color of a tombstone, caped with gelatinous red)—was this Victorian, or was this “irregularities”?",81,"the afternoon sun beating down, his eyes closed, his breathing steady and deep. When he finally stirred, it was with a start that seemed to shake him from a profound sleep rather than from a trance-like state. He sat up, brushing dirt off his clothes, and looked around as if seeing the garden for the first time. ""What a peculiar nap,"" he remarked, more to himself than to me, his voice carrying a hint of confusion. ""I don't remember falling asleep."" His words were simple, yet they carried weight, suggesting a disconnection from the time that had passed. I watched him stand, his movements deliberate and measured, as if each step was calculated. ""Did you feel anything unusual?"" I asked, hoping to understand if this was a symptom of something more serious. ""Just a profound sense of peace,"" he replied, scratching his head in bewilderment. ""Like being submerged in calmness."" His response was unexpected, and it left me pondering the nature of his experience. Was it a manifestation of some internal struggle, or perhaps a momentary escape from his usually guarded demeanor? As he walked back into the house, his expression was one of mild curiosity mixed with a touch of concern. It was clear that this incident had unsettled him, and I couldn't help but wonder what lay behind his enigmatic facade. The incident raised more questions than it answered, leaving me to contemplate the complexities of Graham's character and the potential implications of his mysterious episode."
"So I was anxious about Graham’s disdain for the twenty-first century, because never mind that I felt rejected by it, I was worried that the universe would feel the atemporal sting of his contempt and take","him away. My England wasn’t like this, he’d told me—but this was the natural evolution of his England. I was the natural evolution. I was his lens if he would only raise me and look with me.",73,"its revenge upon him in ways we could never predict or comprehend. The fabric of time, after all, is not as rigid as we perceive it to be, and the disdain of a single individual, no matter how profound, could potentially ripple through the cosmic timeline, altering events or perceptions in unforeseen manners. Perhaps it would mean that certain innovations or cultural shifts that define our era would never come to pass, leaving the future in a state of perpetual antiquity. Or maybe, in a more poetic twist, Graham himself would find himself inexplicably transported to a time that better suited his preferences, only to discover that even then, the essence of the twenty-first century had already permeated every corner of existence, rendering his disdain moot. Regardless, the thought that his feelings could have such a profound and universal impact was enough to keep me awake at night, pondering the strange and intricate ways in which we are all connected to the fabric of time and each other."
"I persuaded Graham to use the tiny office, in which I ordinarily worked, to cram for the test. The Ministry gave no indication of what format","the test would take, or what manner of questions would be asked, or tasks set. I thought this was unfair, and suggested as much to him.",52,"the test would take, so we had to prepare for every possibility. We spent hours going over practice questions, reviewing the latest regulations, and creating flashcards for key terms. Graham, who was usually so confident and composed, showed a rare vulnerability as he struggled to absorb the complex information. I found myself explaining concepts over and over, sometimes repeating the same explanations several times before he seemed to grasp them. Despite his initial reluctance, he eventually opened up about the pressure he felt, not just from the test, but from the expectations placed upon him by his family and the Ministry itself. This test wasn't just a hurdle to clear; it was a defining moment that could shape his entire career. As we worked through the night, the office became a sanctuary of focus and determination, a place where we were both fighting against the clock and the weight of the future. When the sun finally rose, casting its first light through the blinds, we were exhausted but satisfied, knowing we had done everything we could. Graham's confidence had returned, bolstered by our joint effort, and he left the office with a renewed sense of purpose, ready to face whatever the test threw at him."
"There was an embarrassed silence, then: “Shame!” yelled Margaret","from the audience. “Fie! Rhubarb, rhubarb! And diverse other curses!”",19,"she felt compelled to shout, her cheeks burning with the heat of her own condemnation and the collective judgment of the room."
"The person I was referring to was lurking at the far edge of the auditorium, with hair the color of wet earth under moonlight and a pinched, unhappy expression. I don’t think Salese could have looked more disapproving if we’d all started","sucking at one another’s fleshly parts and chanting “Hail, Satan!” The Brigadier was standing beside Salese. They were speaking, heads close together. They looked as if they were in an invisible bell jar of gloom which blocked out the room’s miniature festivities.",84,"stripping off our clothes and dancing naked. Her eyes seemed to bore into us, judging every move, every misplaced step as if it were a betrayal of some sacred trust. The atmosphere she exuded was one of cold, unyielding judgment, a stark contrast to the warmth and joviality that Salese usually brought to any gathering. It was as if Salese's very presence was a beacon of light in the otherwise oppressive gloom Salese cast over the room. Her frown deepened, creasing her forehead in a way that suggested she was not just unhappy but actively disapproving of the entire scene. It was as if she was silently screaming at us to stop, to return to some imagined state of propriety that she alone seemed to uphold. Her arms were folded tightly across her chest, a physical manifestation of her internal disapproval, and her gaze never wavered from us, unblinking and intense. It was uncomfortable, being under the scrutiny of such a stern, disapproving gaze, and it made the frivolity of our actions seem all the more foolish and frivolous. The music continued to play, but its lively beat seemed to falter, unable to compete with the weight of Salese's disapproval. It was as if the very air around her had grown heavier, laden with her disapproval, making it difficult to breathe, to laugh, to continue. I couldn't help but wonder what had led Salese to such a state of unhappiness and judgment. Was there a personal grievance, a misunderstanding, or perhaps a deeper, more profound disappointment that we were oblivious to? Her expression was a puzzle, one that I felt compelled to solve, not just for my own peace of mind but also out of a sense of responsibility to our friend. We needed to understand what had caused this shift in Salese's demeanor, to somehow mend the rift her disapproval had created in our group. Only then could we hope to return to the harmony and camaraderie that had defined our interactions before this unsettling incident."
"“I’m afraid I’ve only ever met the Secretary,” said the Brigadier.",“But I would very much like to meet Vice Secretary Adela.”,22,and never had the pleasure of meeting you before this urgent meeting.
"I went home and, on arrival, checked my emails. As with a driving",test—or the lieutenants’ exam—the acclimatization exam results were delivered immediately. Graham had passed.,26,"car accident, I found several urgent messages from my boss demanding my immediate presence at the office to address a critical situation that had arisen overnight."
"I cycled up to the nice grocery store to buy a bottle of champagne, pausing on the way home for a soft-serve ice cream. I sat on the bench to lick the ripple into a mound and think about the","Brigadier. A man of bivouac experience, I felt; there was something disturbingly makeshift about both him and Salese, as if they’d been dropped behind enemy lines and were mimicking familiarity while waiting for the right moment to cut a throat.",80,"celebration that awaited me. The sun was setting, casting a warm glow over the quiet street, and the gentle hum of evening activity began to fill the air. As I savored the last sweet bite, I felt a sense of anticipation and joy. My mind wandered to the gathering of friends and family, the clinking of glasses, and the shared laughter that would soon echo through the room. The bottle of champagne, now chilling in my basket, seemed to sparkle a little brighter in the fading light, a symbol of the happiness and toasts to come. With a contented sigh, I mounted my bike, eager to share in the festivities and the warmth of human connection."

One of the panel was a Scotsman, and I think he liked that.”",34,"find a secluded spot to live out our days without drawing too much attention to ourselves,” I added, trying to sound more confident than I felt."
"When I brought the glass up—stoppering the rest of the bottle for dinner—I could hear Graham singing “I love to steal awhile away,” occasionally muffled by his drags on a cigarette. Water plashed against the tub.","He dropped to humming and presumably soaping. I slid quietly to the floor and leaned my head against the wall. I wasn’t going to see a Ministry therapist. I knew I should, and I knew I wouldn’t.",73,"His voice, a mix of joy and melancholy, seemed to float above the sound of the water, creating a peculiar ambiance in the small bathroom. I couldn't help but smile at the sight; it was a rare moment of vulnerability and happiness. Graham, usually so guarded and stoic, let his guard down in the privacy of his own bathroom, surrounded by steam and the soothing sound of water. The song choice was oddly fitting for his life—a life that had been anything but stable or predictable. ""I love to steal awhile away,"" he sang, the words resonating with a deeper meaning, perhaps about his longing for moments of peace amidst the chaos of his existence. The cigarette smoke mingled with the steam, creating a soft haze that added to the intimate atmosphere. It was a picture of solitude and introspection, a stark contrast to the public persona he maintained. I stood there, quietly observing, feeling a sense of connection and understanding that transcended our usual interactions. In that moment, I realized how much we all seek solace in our own ways, often in the most unexpected places and times. Graham's song choice, his solitary act of smoking and singing, spoke volumes about his inner world, a world that was usually hidden behind his stoic facade. It was a reminder that beneath the surface, everyone has a story, a set of dreams, and a longing for moments of escape and happiness. As I capped the bottle and prepared to leave the bathroom, I carried with me a newfound appreciation for the small, seemingly insignificant moments that can reveal so much about the human condition."
"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century. On ships there were cooks and officers’ stewards; at home, on the few occasions he was at home, there were women. Nevertheless, he had taken to cooking in a way he had failed to take to","television or texting or the use of deodorants (“I bathe every day,” he’d said to me with hurt dignity). Tonight, he hummed with a busyness that hardly shielded nervousness. He burned the onions and automatically reached for his cigarettes. I took them away—I didn’t want ashy Bolognese—and he accused me of “nanny-stating” him, a turn of phrase I found very alarming because I certainly hadn’t taught it to him. Where was he picking this stuff up?",152,"cooking in the past. It was a practical skill, one that he had come to appreciate deeply during his time in the wilderness of the Canadian north, where the ability to transform raw ingredients into sustenance was not just a luxury but a necessity for survival. In the vast, untamed landscapes, where the nearest store was often days away, Graham had learned to forage for berries, hunt small game, and fish the clear streams. He had mastered the art of starting a fire with flint and steel, and he could tell by the smell of the air when a storm was brewing. Cooking became a meditative practice for him, a way to connect with the land and the elements. He would start each day by gathering fresh ingredients from the surrounding forest, and by evening, he would sit by a crackling fire, knife in hand, preparing a meal that was as much about sustenance as it was about the simple pleasure of creating something from nothing. He found a strange comfort in the routine, a sense of accomplishment that came from knowing he could provide for himself. As he honed his skills, he discovered a joy in the process that he had never anticipated. Cooking was no longer just about filling his stomach; it was about preserving the memories of the places he had been and the experiences he had gathered along the way. When he finally returned to the modern world, carrying with him the knowledge and skills of the wilderness, he approached the kitchen with a newfound confidence. He was no longer a novice, but a chef, drawing upon his experiences to create dishes that were as innovative as they were delicious. Graham's journey from a man who had never cooked to a skilled chef was a testament to his adaptability and his ability to find beauty and purpose in the most unexpected places."
Margaret was wearing high-waisted cerulean bell-bottoms and a white blouse clocked with lace. She looked like a disco,"goddess, an astonishing concoction given that she was only barely older than the piano, never mind the synth.",36,"queen, her hair styled in voluminous curls framing her face, her smile radiant and infectious, as she twirled around in the dance floor, her laughter mingling with the music, drawing everyone into her joyful celebration of life."
"Arthur was happy and flushed. He was one of those unusual extroverts who have all the attributes of an introvert, save that they like being around other people. He had a gift for gentleness too, one of the rarest virtues in","any gender and especially in the kind of man Arthur was supposed to be. I eased some biography out of him: half-decent public school; classics at Oxford, where he’d had a lot of fun and failed his exams; retraining as a doctor.",83,"human society. His laughter was infectious, and he had a way of making others feel seen and valued. He approached life with a childlike wonder, always eager to learn and explore. Despite his outgoing nature, he was deeply thoughtful and could hold long conversations about philosophy, literature, and the human condition. His friends often found themselves confiding in him, drawn to his empathetic ear and his ability to offer comfort without judgment. In a world that sometimes prized loud voices and aggressive personalities, Arthur's quiet strength and genuine kindness stood out, leaving a lasting impression on all who crossed his path."
I saw Graham’s eyebrow quirk in a rascally way as he did,"the math. “You became a captain extremely quickly, Sixteen. Found your forte?”",24,"he pretended not to notice the way I fumbled with my words, a mischievous glint in his eye."
"Arthur grimaced. I saw his hand shiver momentarily on his glass, and then he","swallowed everything in it with a wet click. “Promotion was—fast—in the war,” he said shortly.",29,"regained its former composure, betraying nothing of the inward struggle that had just taken place."
"Margaret, incidentally, listened to the men talk about their careers with a suffused urgency that only I noticed. In her own era, she’d slept in the room next to the one where she had been born.","She thought Scotland was far-flung and semi-barbaric. When we came round to talking about my time working as a translator in Cambodia, I felt her attention all over me. I may have talked slightly too much.",72,"she had watched her mother bring forth her siblings, the sounds of life and labor echoing through the thin walls. Her own childhood was a tapestry woven with these memories, each thread a story of resilience and unspoken sacrifice. Now, as she sat among these strangers, their voices a distant murmur, Margaret felt a profound connection to her past and a deep-seated drive to ensure that her own legacy would be one of empowerment and understanding. She realized that her time was limited, yet the stories she had to share were endless, each one a beacon of hope for those who listened. In her heart, she knew that her true calling was to bridge the gap between generations, to impart the wisdom of her experiences to those who would listen, and in doing so, to inspire them to carve their own paths with the same courage and determination that she had exhibited throughout her life."
"How the topic of weed came up I couldn’t remember—probably during one of the vigorous debates about what the twenty-first century had genuinely improved, which in",the opinion of the expats was a mixed bag. I was shortly handing my grinder and papers to Graham (who was far more adept at rolling).,52,"our discussion seemed to be mostly about the ways it hadn't. As the conversation meandered through various examples of technological advancements that had promised to revolutionize daily life but ultimately fell short, someone mentioned the legalization of marijuana in some states. This sparked a lively debate among us, ranging from the potential economic benefits to the societal implications. Some argued that it was a step towards a more progressive and less punitive society, while others feared it could lead to increased addiction and a loss of productivity. The conversation swirled around the idea that despite the promises of innovation and freedom, many aspects of life remained stubbornly unchanged, with the legalization of weed serving as a metaphor for both the progress and the limitations of societal evolution."
"Meeting Margaret made me vivid and receptive. Sentences weighed more. I kept a half-conscious catalog of where the men were looking. I’ve seen people deal with this in different ways. By “this,” I mean power. I mean magnetism. I try to absorb it. Within twenty minutes Margaret","and I were planning a girls-take-Soho night out, which necessitated me explaining the history of Soho, the concept of clubbing, the genre of R & B, the club night R & She, and dancing. I hadn’t been clubbing since I was an assistant in Languages. No matter.",94,"had effortlessly become the center of attention. Her presence was commanding yet graceful, drawing the eyes and minds of those around her without uttering a single word. She carried herself with an air of confidence that was both alluring and intimidating. I observed how the men in the room subtly adjusted their postures, trying to mirror her poise, while their gazes lingered a moment too long, betraying their attempts at nonchalance. Some leaned in slightly, as if to catch every nuance of her expression, while others maintained a distance, perhaps out of respect or a more cautious approach to her influence. Her laughter, when it came, was light and musical, echoing through the space and leaving a lingering warmth that seemed to soften the edges of the room. I realized then that Margaret possessed a rare gift, one that allowed her to command a room not through overt displays of power, but through the subtle art of presence. She was not just a person in the room; she was the room itself, the gravitational center around which everything else revolved. As I watched her interact with the others, I felt a mix of admiration and a subtle envy. I wondered how one could cultivate such an aura, and whether it was a skill that could be learned or merely an innate quality that some were blessed with. In that moment, Margaret taught me more about influence and magnetism than any book or lecture could. She embodied the idea that true power is not about dominating others, but about inspiring them, drawing them in not with force, but with the sheer pull of one's own being."
"“Such matters are between myself and God,” he said gravely. “Oh, stop frowning, Sixty-five.","Arthur, will you please lead her in a polka, if you can still stand.”",28,"It is not your place to judge or interfere, and I trust you will respect that boundary."
"“In this age, musicians are imprinted inside music boxes, and there is no need for the band to","keep time,” said Margaret. “You will instruct me in the polka, or I will step on your toes.”",36,"perform live, as every note can be perfectly replicated by these mechanical musicians. The authenticity of a live performance, with its unpredictable elements and emotional connection, has become a rare commodity, cherished by those who seek a deeper experience beyond the mechanical precision of the music boxes. The human element, once the heart and soul of music, now competes with the flawless execution offered by technology, leading to a society where the line between human creativity and mechanical reproduction blurs, raising questions about the future of art and the value we place on imperfection and genuine human expression."
"Arthur, by contrast, danced beautifully. He dipped me, and I bent like","a reed. He spun me, and I was, with such satisfaction, spun.",24,"an elegant swan, my dress trailing behind like water lilies in a pond."
"As soon as she stepped in, I started making a tally of the evidence of unbeauty. There was a chair whose seat was filled with clothes too dirty for the wardrobe but too clean for the washing basket. My bedside table sprouted two water glasses and a mug. Dust crouched on the skirting boards and in the seams of","my chest of drawers. When a woman is as impossibly attractive as Margaret, the mediocrity shed by a woman like me bustles around her like a horde of pigeons. Or so I thought, at that time. Truthfully, I’d been foxed by how beautiful she was. I felt a complicated anguish when I saw her little besocked toes treadling the carpet.",119,"the carpet. The air was thick with the scent of yesterday's lunch, a mix of half-eaten sandwich and cold coffee, lingering long after the plate and cup had been abandoned on the coffee table. The walls, covered in a patterned wallpaper that had seen better days, seemed to close in with the weight of untended chores. A stack of unwashed dishes stood sentinel in the sink, their surfaces crusted with the remnants of meals past. The television, a relic from a bygone era, squatted in the corner, its screen speckled with the ghostly images of programs long concluded. It was a room that spoke volumes of neglect, a silent witness to the absence of care and the presence of life's mundane, often overlooked details."
Margaret appeared unaware of any of these concerns. She didn’t even glance at herself,in the mirror. She gave me an interested grin as I pulled out my lipsticks.,29,"in the mirror, focusing instead on the young girl who was eagerly awaiting her turn to try on the fancy dress. Her innocence and excitement seemed to fill the room with a warm, comforting glow, momentarily overshadowing the tension that had been building among the adults."
"I’d stopped wearing it—I was, at the time, thinking of the way my face might be received by a Victorian who didn’t approve of cosmetics—but I demonstrated the coverage of my sole foundation. Margaret","was amazed by the smoothness of its application and the faithfulness of its shade. She drew an arrow with it on her cheek. On her fair skin, it looked like clay. We started giggling.",68,"watched, her eyes widening slightly as I pressed my bare foot onto a white napkin, then lifted it to show the faintest trace of my skin tone, almost invisible against the cloth. ""It's like magic,"" she murmured, a mix of fascination and disbelief in her voice. She reached out, touching the napkin gently, as if expecting the ghostly imprint to vanish at her touch. Instead, it remained, a testament to the product's effectiveness. Margaret's curiosity was piqued, and she began to pepper me with questions about the foundation, its application, and its benefits. I explained how it worked to even out skin tone, cover blemishes, and provide a matte finish that lasted for hours without feeling heavy or cakey. She listened intently, her mind racing with possibilities. Perhaps this was the breakthrough she had been seeking, a way to bridge the gap between her old-fashioned ideals and the modern world's embrace of personal expression through makeup. As we continued our conversation, Margaret's initial judgment seemed to soften, replaced by a growing respect for my choices and a newfound openness to exploring the world of cosmetics herself."
"The door grumbled shut and I fell back into a doze. Margaret was snoring lightly, like a puppy being squeezed. The door reopened, and I","surfaced to vague consciousness. I felt a wave of cool air, and then a gentle warmth. He had spread a blanket over the pair of us.",51,"woke with a start, the sound of footsteps echoing in the empty hallway. The moonlight streamed through the slightly ajar door, casting long shadows across the room. I listened intently, my heart pounding, as the steps grew louder, closer. A chill ran down my spine as I realized I wasn't alone in the house. The intruder was near, and I had to decide whether to confront them or hide, hoping they wouldn't find me. The suspense was unbearable, each creak of the floorboards a potential threat, as I lay there, trapped between fear and the need to protect Margaret."
"All the expats had phones, paid for (and tapped) by the Ministry. Graham had switched his own phone on a total of three times in the seven","months he had been in the twenty-first century. I was therefore unsurprised when, about half an hour after their plane landed, I got a call from Arthur’s phone.",55,"months since arriving in the city. Each time, he'd listened to the static-filled line ring out, the silence on the other end a confirmation of the isolation he felt. Graham knew the risks of communicating in such a manner, but the need to speak to someone who understood his situation, who could offer advice or simply a sympathetic ear, outweighed his fears. He had considered using coded language, substituting innocuous words for those that carried the true weight of his messages, but the complexity of maintaining such a facade worried him. It was safer, he reasoned, to remain silent, to let the Ministry believe they had the upper hand by intercepting his communications. Yet, today, a sense of urgency gnawed at him. He had received a message, a whisper of a lead on a way out, a path to freedom that might never present itself again. Graham's fingers trembled slightly as he dialed, the familiar weight of the phone heavy in his hand. He took a deep breath, steadying himself, and then pressed the call button."
"Arthur was striding up the street, bent slightly against a wind which didn’t exist. He was wearing a tweed jacket and looked like a period piece,","but then again, so did Pimlico. I hadn’t seen him since the men had got back from Scotland and I asked him whether he enjoyed his trip.",53,"his face set in a determined expression that seemed incongruous with the whimsical setting. His brow furrowed in concentration, as if wrestling with an invisible adversary, his hands tucked into the pockets of his jacket. The town, with its quaint shops and cobblestone streets, seemed oblivious to the battle he faced within himself, a conflict between the modernity he represented and the timeless charm of the bygone era he embodied."
"It paid off in the early autumn. When I came down for breakfast one morning, I found","Graham at the counter with a dictionary and a tin of protein powder, performing exegesis on the label.",35,"the table set for two, and a note from my wife saying she had gone to the market and would be back soon. It was a moment of pure joy, seeing the fruits of our labor and the small acts of love she had prepared, knowing that despite the hardships, our bond had grown stronger through shared experiences and mutual support."
"Adela was of the “never been to the GP in my life because I’m not a pussy” school of care, and nothing changed. If the expats were","dangerously ill, they’d be removed to the wards and never mind the trigger; if they could get a grip and deal with it at home, they should.",54,"she had, she would have been diagnosed with a severe case of hypochondria, convinced she was dying from every minor ailment. Her stubbornness and pride prevented her from seeking medical advice, even when it was clearly needed. This attitude not only endangered her health but also made her a burden to those around her who had to watch helplessly as she deteriorated. Eventually, a crisis point was reached when her condition became so dire that she could no longer ignore it, but by then, the damage was extensive, and recovery was a long and arduous process."
"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs. Given the prevalence of prostitution in Victorian England, the nonexistence of reliable barrier contraception in his era, and the fact that he was a sailor, this suggested he was either a virgin or very lucky. But then again, I knew enough about his biography to know that he was very, very lucky.",141,"of his diary from that period, in which he'd written, with a kind of horrified fascination, about the 'unbridled carnality' of the era. He seemed both repulsed and intrigued by it, as though he couldn't quite reconcile the fact that such a fundamental aspect of human nature was so different from the austere and restrained practices of his own time. This ambivalence made him an enigma, and I found myself both curious and cautious about how to approach the subject with him. One evening, after a particularly awkward silence, I decided to try to engage him in conversation about it. I began by asking if he'd ever read any of the contemporary sex advice books that were popular at the time, hoping to gauge his level of interest and openness. Graham looked at me for a moment, his expression unreadable, before he replied that he had indeed come across such works, though he found them 'overly simplistic and reductionist.' He went on to explain that he believed sexuality was a complex and multifaceted aspect of human existence that couldn't be adequately understood through the lens of quick fixes and superficial guidance. This struck a chord with me, as it echoed sentiments I'd felt myself about the commodification and trivialization of sex in modern culture. Our conversation continued into the night, delving deeper into the philosophical and ethical implications of sexuality in the twenty-first century. Despite the initial awkwardness, it was a conversation that brought us closer, as we discovered common ground in our critical perspectives and mutual curiosity about the human condition. Graham's insights, though coming from a vastly different context, offered a refreshing and thought-provoking counterpoint to my own views, enriching my understanding of the complexities surrounding sexuality and relationships. This dialogue marked a turning point in our interactions, as we began to communicate more openly and authentically about a range of topics, including the personal and the profound. It was a testament to the power of conversation to bridge gaps in understanding and to reveal the shared humanity that transcends time and cultural differences."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory. Every time I gave Graham a book, I was trying to shunt him along a story I’d been telling myself all my life.",101,
Graham was adamant about not informing the Ministry about his illness. It was the closest I had,ever seen him to entreating. I thought about it a lot. I liked being entreated by him.,34,"come to seeing him break down, a sight that was utterly foreign to me, his usually stoic demeanor shattered by the weight of his secret. He spoke of the stigma, the fear of losing his position, and the shame that would follow if his condition became public knowledge. His words painted a picture of a man trapped not only by his ailment but by the societal expectations and the rigid structure of the Ministry. I listened, feeling a mix of frustration and helplessness, realizing that in this world, even the most basic human right to health without fear of repercussion was a privilege afforded to few. It was a stark reminder of the injustices that permeated our society, and it left me questioning the very foundations upon which the Ministry stood."
"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled. Then again, whose upper management am I not describing? Who trusts their workplace? Who thinks their job is on the side of right? They fed us all poison from a bottle marked “prestige,” and we developed a high tolerance for bitterness. I would have been more frightened if the pressure lifted, like an indoor cat struck by sudden rain.",119,"and her stories seemed spun from air. Yet, I was drawn to her, perhaps by some inexplicable charm or a deeper, darker fascination. I wanted to believe her, to see the good in her, to think that she could be innocent, that her actions were driven by some misunderstood motive. I was blinded by my own desires and the hope for a simpler truth. Now, looking back, I see how my naivety was exploited, how I became an unwitting accomplice to a scheme that I would never have condoned had I fully understood its implications. The weight of my actions presses heavily on me, a constant reminder of the consequences of misplaced trust and the tragic flaw of overestimating the goodness in people. I am left to grapple with the reality that sometimes the most convincing facades hide the most malevolent intentions, and that the most innocent-seeming actions can lead to the gravest of outcomes."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.",39,"for me to have such authority over him. I explained the power dynamics at play, how his compliance was essential for the team's cohesion and success, and that my role demanded strict adherence to discipline. I emphasized that in a team setting, individual desires must sometimes yield to the collective good, a lesson he would come to understand more profoundly as he matured in his leadership role."
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.",56,"his fingers, staring blankly at the wall. His eyes, usually so vibrant and alive, were dull, and his posture slumped in a way that was entirely unlike him. ""Graham?"" I asked, my voice laced with concern as I approached him. He didn't respond, only continued to smoke, the smoke curling upwards and dissipating into the air. I set down my bag and took a seat next to him, my own worry growing. ""What's wrong?"" I finally ventured, my hand reaching out to gently touch his arm. He flinched slightly, turning his head to look at me, but his gaze was distant, as if he saw right through me. ""I'm fine,"" he muttered, though his tone belied the words. ""You don't seem fine,"" I pointed out, trying to keep my voice steady. ""You've been like this all day. You haven't eaten, you haven't spoken much, and now you're smoking."" I watched as he took another drag, the cigarette burning steadily between his fingers. ""I'm just thinking,"" he said after a moment, exhaling a stream of smoke. ""About what?"" I pressed, my curiosity piqued. ""About everything,"" he replied, a hint of frustration in his voice. ""About the past, about the future, about what it all means."" His words struck a chord within me, and I realized that perhaps his silence wasn't just a sign of being lost in thought, but a struggle with deeper, more complex emotions. ""Graham,"" I began, choosing my words carefully, ""it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Life can be tough, and sometimes it feels like too much. But you're not alone in this. I'm here for you, and so are your friends. We can help you figure things out, if you'll let us."" He looked at me then, really looked, and for a moment, I saw the flicker of the Graham I knew, the one who was strong and resilient. ""Do you really think we can?"" he asked, a hint of hope in his voice. ""Absolutely,"" I affirmed, squeezing his arm gently. ""We'll get through this together."" And in that moment, I felt a renewed sense of purpose, determined to support my friend through whatever storm he was navigating."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers. He took in anecdotes about my childhood meals as if they would contribute to a portrait of a whole woman. He ignored the fact that mostly I cooked assorted chicken pieces on rice. I could tell him things about galangal, and he found that very profound.",94,"he meticulously crafted in his studio. One day, he brought over a stack of cookbooks, their pages filled with recipes that seemed to dance off the pages, each more exotic than the last. ""I want to make something for you,"" he declared, his eyes alight with determination. ""Something that reminds me of home."" I watched as he poured over the recipes, his fingers tracing the lines of text, pausing at ingredients unfamiliar to my own kitchen. He decided on a dish from a small village in Thailand, a place he had once visited, where the flavors were as vibrant as the colors of the market stalls. He set to work, chopping, dicing, and stirring with a focus that was almost meditative. The kitchen filled with the aroma of lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime leaves, a fragrant symphony that stirred memories in my own heart. When the dish was ready, he presented it to me with a flourish, his eyes seeking my approval. I took a bite, and the flavors exploded in my mouth, a burst of citrus, spice, and warmth that transported me to a tropical paradise. It was more than just food; it was an expression of his affection, a bridge between two worlds. From that day on, our meals became a shared adventure, a journey through the diverse tapestry of Southeast Asian cuisine, each dish a story, each flavor a memory."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization. I wanted him in a role that didn’t require him to be at sea for months, possibly years,","at a time. It was too soon, I told myself. Whatever Adela said, he wasn’t ready, he’d barely left London, let alone land. But I wanted him to stay for other reasons too. It was humiliating to know that about myself and to say nothing into his implacable placidity.",98,"where he could be closer to home and the life we were beginning to build here. We discussed various options, from teaching English to working in international relations, leveraging his experience and language skills. Ultimately, he found a position with an organization that focused on disaster relief and international development, a role that allowed him to utilize his naval experience in coordinating rescue operations and providing strategic support to affected communities. This job offered the perfect balance: he would contribute to meaningful causes while remaining grounded in our new life. As he started this journey, I felt a mix of pride and anxiety; pride for his determination and the path he chose, and anxiety for the challenges that lay ahead. Yet, I knew that this was the beginning of a new chapter for us, one where we would continue to grow and adapt, just as the city around us was ever-changing."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.",64,"As the familiar melody filled the room, Graham's friends exchanged amused glances, knowing well of his peculiar taste in music. The song's upbeat tempo clashed with the somber mood of the farewell gathering, creating an odd juxtaposition that somehow seemed fitting for Graham's eccentric personality. Despite the incongruity, it served as a reminder of the unique bond they shared, one that was characterized by acceptance and a touch of the absurd. As the chorus approached, Graham, oblivious to the mixed reactions around him, tapped his foot in rhythm, a small smile playing on his lips. The moment was oddly endearing, encapsulating the essence of their friendship in a single, seemingly incongruous song choice. It was a testament to the idea that sometimes, it's the unexpected elements of life that leave the most lasting impressions."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes. One of his first searches was charmingly housewifely: “Most challenging recipes”; “How to make cheese soufflé”; “What is miso paste?”; “Where to buy miso paste”; “How long has Japan been open to Europe?” A day or so after I’d read this report, I received another that listed the following search terms:",122,
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing,","as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday. This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option. We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit. Still, we had not told them about the death camps.",151,
"“It’s better that we continue to work closely with Eighteen-forty-seven,” Adela","had said, “given that he seems likely to survive the year.”",22,"and maintain our strategic alliance, ensuring mutual benefits and continued prosperity for both parties involved,"" Adela concluded, her voice carrying the weight of the decision that would shape their future endeavors."
"Adela’s voice contracted on that last sentence. She wiped her gaze, concentrated in her one working eye, up and down my face, to see if I’d noticed, and continued, “Our first priority","is protecting the expats and the time-door. The time-door has been moved to a secure location. I suggest you retake the physical aptitude assessment, and then we can work on your lateral-reasoning scores—”",65,"is to secure the perimeter. We can't afford any surprises. I've already dispatched a team to scout the area and establish a defensive line. We need to know who we're dealing with and what resources they might have at their disposal. Additionally, I've contacted our contacts in the local law enforcement to inform them of the situation and request their assistance if necessary. It's crucial that we approach this with caution and strategy. We must consider all possible scenarios and prepare for the worst while hoping for the best. Our goal is to protect the community and ensure everyone's safety. We'll work through the night if needed, and I expect everyone to remain vigilant and focused on the task at hand."
"Arthur was gentle, no matter how grotty my behavior. He had found out about Scrabble, and he sometimes brought",his travel set along—my inner competitive bitch could stave off a black mood for half an hour or so.,38,"the game to our sessions, turning it into a friendly competition that brought us closer despite my initial reluctance to engage in such a cerebral activity. His patience and encouragement made me realize that Scrabble was not just a game but a tool for bonding and expressing creativity, even in the midst of my personal turmoil and resistance to change. Over time, I began to appreciate the quiet strength and unwavering support Arthur offered, transforming our dynamic from one of strained familial duty to genuine companionship built on mutual respect and shared moments of triumph and defeat on the Scrabble board."
"My email made a chiding noise. Adela was the originator, and she’d put me in blind copy.",It was a short email. Adela had a real gift for cramming apoplexy into a couple of lines.,35,"My phone vibrated with the incoming message, and I quickly glanced at the screen to see Adela's name accompanied by the dreaded 'blind copy' indicator, signaling that my response would be seen only by her, not the entire group chat, as was often her strategy to avoid group consensus and exert her will more discreetly."
The email told us that her death would be reported to the expats as,"a suicide. “This cannot be emphasized enough,” Adela had written, with a double underline.",28,"an unfortunate accident, which was to be kept under wraps to avoid unnecessary panic and speculation among the community."
"Arthur smiled and sat down beside me, stretching out his long legs. Twisting the signet ring on his finger—a tell as","clarion as my skin biting—he murmured, “We didn’t know her as well as we would have liked. I wish we had.”",42,"he had done countless times before when he was nervous or deep in thought. His eyes, usually so lively and full of mischief, were now fixed on a point in the distance, betraying a hint of sadness that was unusual for him. I waited, unsure of how to breach the silence that had settled between us, feeling the weight of his unspoken words. Finally, he spoke, his voice lower than usual, ""I've been thinking, Eames,"" he began, pausing as if the words were difficult to form, ""about our job tomorrow. It's not just another extraction, is it?"""
"Anne Spencer almost made it off those wards. After I read the email, an ancient and exuberant terror blazed through me. It was partly the terror that had grown in me alongside my very bones,","knowing as I did that I only existed because my mother had outrun almost; I don’t know at what point you stop feeling the need to run, generation by generation, when you’re born after that.",70,"partly the terror that had grown in me alongside my very bones, partly the terror that had been thrust upon me by the sudden, shocking revelation that someone I cared for deeply was in grave danger. My heart pounded against my ribs like a caged bird desperate for freedom, each beat a frantic plea for action. I sprang from my chair, the wood scraping against the floor with a sound that seemed to echo the urgency of my thoughts. I grabbed my coat, not bothering to check if it was properly buttoned or if my shoes were tied, and rushed out of the door, the cold air biting at my face as if it too was eager to see the outcome of my haste. The hospital loomed ahead, its sterile white walls a stark contrast to the grey sky, a beacon of hope and despair intertwined. I ran, my breath forming misty clouds in the air, each inhalation a gasp of fear and determination. I needed to get to Anne, to be there for her, to protect her from whatever malevolent force had ensnared her. My mind raced, formulating plans and scenarios, each more desperate than the last. The hospital doors swung open with a heavy thud, welcoming me into its labyrinthine corridors. I navigated them with a mixture of familiarity and panic, my footsteps echoing off the walls, a testament to the urgency of my mission. Nurses and doctors moved about with practiced calm, oblivious to the storm that raged within me. I finally reached the ward where Anne was, or at least, where I hoped she was. The door was ajar, a small crack letting in the faint sound of a television playing in the background. I pushed it open, my eyes scanning the room for Anne. There she was, sitting up in her bed, a look of confusion and fear etched across her face. She saw me, and for a moment, her expression softened, relief mingling with the fear. ""Alex,"" she whispered, her voice hoarse from disuse. ""It's okay, Anne,"" I said, stepping closer, trying to project calmness I didn't feel. ""I'm here now. Whatever it is, we'll face it together."""
"He was sitting at the noisome kitchen table, staring at nothing. Rogue Male was lying splayed and face down by the ashtray. The thing in my chest kicked again","as I realized he must have grabbed it as we left our home. When I came in, he didn’t move anything but his gaze, which swung up like a whip.",59,"with a force that made my breath catch. I reached out, my hand hovering over the lifeless form of Rogue Male, a symbol of my failed mission, a reminder of the danger I had escaped. The room was silent except for the distant hum of the city, a stark contrast to the cacophony of my thoughts. Each beat of my heart was a drumroll to the inevitable moment when I would have to confront the reality of my situation. The ashtray, filled with the remnants of my contemplative smoking, seemed to mock me with its permanence. I needed a plan, a way out, but first, I had to understand the implications of my failure. The mission was supposed to be simple: infiltrate, gather intelligence, and escape unnoticed. Yet, here I was, with a dead cat and a pounding heart, contemplating my next move. The weight of Rogue Male's lifeless body underlined the gravity of my predicament. I knew I couldn't stay here; the authorities would soon be on my trail. My mind raced, formulating options, each more dangerous than the last. The clock was ticking, and I had to act fast. The room seemed to close in on me, the air thick with the scent of cigarette smoke and fear. I took a deep breath, steadying myself, and made a decision. I had to move, to disappear into the city's labyrinthine streets, using my knowledge of the city's back alleys and forgotten places to evade capture. The journey ahead would be fraught with peril, but it was the only way to ensure my survival. As I stood up, ready to face the unknown, I couldn't help but feel a surge of defiance. I would not go down without a fight. Rogue Male's sacrifice would not be in vain. With determination fueling my steps, I prepared to embark on the most dangerous game of hide and seek I had ever played."
