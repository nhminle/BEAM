"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking. Lacerations too, from a Taser—he’d shot at two of the team members who’d come to expatriate him, and a third was forced to fire.","the remaining five were still struggling to come to terms with their new surroundings, a world that was both familiar and yet, utterly alien.

The culture shock was overwhelming, and Graham often found himself wondering if he had made a terrible mistake by agreeing to be part of the temporal relocation program. The memories of his life in the 19th century still lingered, and he couldn't help but feel a deep sense of loss and disconnection from the world he once knew. As he navigated the complexities of modern society, Graham couldn't shake off the feeling that he was a relic from another era, a stranger in a strange land. The language, the customs, the technology – everything was so different, and yet, he was expected to adapt and integrate seamlessly. The pressure was mounting, and Graham began to question whether he had the resilience to survive in this brave new world. He thought about the others, his fellow expats, and wondered how they were coping with their own struggles. Were they, like him, struggling to find their place in this unfamiliar world, or had they managed to find a way to thrive in this strange new reality? The uncertainty was suffocating, and Graham couldn't help but feel a deep sense of longing for the life he left behind, a life that was now nothing more than a distant memory."
"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into","his eighties. As it was, he was thirty-seven years old and had not experienced crinolines, A Tale of Two Cities, or the enfranchisement of the working classes.","the early twentieth century, and would have likely been familiar with the humble, unassuming nature of such dwellings.

The house itself was small, with a narrow facade and a steeply pitched roof, giving it a somewhat cramped and claustrophobic appearance. Despite its modest size, however, the house had a certain charm to it, with its intricate brickwork and ornate window frames, which seemed to speak of a bygone era. As Gore stepped inside, he was struck by the musty smell of old carpets and the faint scent of coal smoke, which lingered in the air like a ghostly presence. The interior was just as unassuming as the exterior, with plain plaster walls and simple wooden furnishings, but there was a sense of warmth and comfort to the place, a sense of being a real home, rather than just a temporary residence. Gore felt a pang of nostalgia as he looked around, remembering the countless other houses he had lived in over the years, each one a temporary refuge from the demands of his work. This one, however, felt different, felt like a place where he could finally rest and be himself, without the burden of his responsibilities weighing him down."

"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale. A vile smell was seeping up from the floor.","leak was causing a small flood in the corner of the room, and the air was thick with the smell of smoke and",39,"leak was causing a small flood in the corner of the room, and the air was thick with the smell of smoke and dampness, a stark contrast to the excitement and anticipation that filled the hearts of the team as they embarked on their new project, with Gore's nervous energy being a palpable force that seemed to drive everyone forward, despite the chaotic surroundings, and as they began to discuss their plans and objectives, it became clear that this was going to be a journey like no other, filled with challenges and obstacles, but also with opportunities for growth and discovery, and the team's collective sense of purpose and determination was evident in the way they tackled each problem that arose, from the leaking pipe to the outdated equipment, with a sense of camaraderie and shared responsibility that would ultimately define their experience and shape the outcome of their endeavors."
"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer. I’m sure he knew plenty about ship’s rigging, but he’d probably never handled an instrument more technologically complex than a sextant.

It's likely that he relied on the expertise of others to navigate the complexities of the new equipment, and it's possible that this lack of personal understanding may have led to some difficulties in his role. As the world around him continued to evolve at a rapid pace, Gore must have found himself struggling to keep up with the demands of his position, and it's a testament to his character that he was able to adapt and find a way to succeed despite these challenges. The transition from the Age of Sail to the era of modern technology was not an easy one, and it's fascinating to consider the ways in which individuals like Gore were able to bridge the gap between these two vastly different worlds. Despite the many advances that have been made since Gore's time, his story remains a compelling reminder of the importance of perseverance and determination in the face of uncertainty and change."
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people. Hunting was out of the question, and socializing was limited by order of the Ministry. By the end of the first week he was visibly going bonkers with no one but me to talk to.","reading classical literature, with a particular fondness for the works of Shakespeare and Dickens.

His interests were diverse and eclectic, reflecting a curious and adventurous spirit that had been nurtured from a young age. As I delved deeper into his life, I found that Gore's passions and hobbies were not merely passing fancies, but rather an integral part of his being, shaping his worldview and informing his interactions with others. His love of nature, for instance, had instilled in him a profound respect for the environment, and he had been an early advocate for conservation efforts in his community. Similarly, his artistic pursuits had given him a unique perspective on the world, allowing him to see beauty in unexpected places and to appreciate the intricate details that often go unnoticed. Through his many interests and activities, Gore had cultivated a rich inner life, one that was marked by a sense of wonder, a love of learning, and a deep appreciation for the complexities and mysteries of human experience."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea.

This unique perspective allowed him to observe the evolution of society with a mix of fascination and detachment, as if he were a chronicler of history rather than a participant. His thoughts were a rich tapestry of past and present, woven together by the threads of his experiences and observations. The world, to him, was a dynamic entity, constantly shifting and morphing, yet remaining somehow static in its essence. This dichotomy was reflected in his own persona, a blend of the traditional and the modern, the conservative and the progressive. As he walked through the bustling streets of the contemporary city, he carried with him the weight of centuries, his eyes seeing not just the skyscrapers and the neon lights, but the ghosts of empires risen and fallen, the whispers of forgotten eras, and the promises of a future yet to be written. His was a life of layers, each one revealing a new facet of his character, a new dimension to his understanding of the world and his place within it. And so, he stood at the crossroads of time, a traveler between eras, a bridge spanning the chasm between the past and the present, forever bound to the deck of his metaphorical ship, sailing the seas of history, charting a course through the uncharted waters of the human experience."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake. Another person’s unguardedness in that moment can be very useful, interpersonally, as long as you don’t soften. There is language I could use about this if I were the melodramatic type: behind enemy lines, for example, or double agent. My sister might use these terms, or she might call me a fraud.","he inevitably would, given the nature of our relationship and the fact that secrets have a way of unraveling over time - I wondered if he would feel betrayed, not by the fact itself, but by my decision to let him believe what he wanted to for so long.

It's a delicate balance, allowing someone to see you through the lens of their own perceptions without correcting them, especially when those perceptions are rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of who you are. This dance between truth and deception, or perhaps more accurately, between revelation and concealment, is one that many of us perform daily, often without even realizing it. We let people assume certain things about us, sometimes because it's easier, sometimes because it's safer, and sometimes because we're not sure how to articulate the truth even to ourselves. In my case, the truth was complex, layered with nuances that I was still uncovering. I had grown accustomed to the space his assumption had given me, a space to observe and learn without the burden of other people's expectations. But as our connection deepened, the weight of this unspoken truth began to feel more like a barrier than a bridge. I knew that eventually, I would have to decide whether to continue in the comfort of his misconception or to risk altering the dynamics of our relationship by revealing the reality of my identity, a decision that would undoubtedly change everything."

The air in the room appears to thicken, heavy with anticipation and a sense of foreboding, as all eyes turn to Stanley, awaiting his next statement, their faces reflecting a mix of curiosity and apprehension."

As the crew goes about their daily routines, they can't help but feel a sense of unease and vulnerability, their senses heightened as they wait for the inevitable moment when the ice will finally give way and the ship will be set free. But for now, they remain trapped, suspended in a state of limbo, at the mercy of the Arctic's unpredictable and often brutal whims. The creaking and groaning of the ship's wooden hull echoes through the stillness, a haunting melody that seems to reverberate deep within their very souls, a reminder that they are not alone in this desolate landscape, but are instead part of a much larger and more complex ecosystem, one that is both beautiful and terrifying in its power and majesty."
"Once we arrived at the Ministry, an escort of subtly armed suits took Gore to meet the other expats. I was expecting he’d","go through a group therapy session, but Gore was in a sunny mood, so he must have been envisaging something closer to a salon.","be ushered into some sort of high-level meeting or briefing, but instead, he was led to a nondescript conference room where a handful",47,"be ushered into some sort of high-level meeting or briefing, but instead, he was led to a nondescript conference room where a handful of individuals with varied expressions of curiosity and suspicion awaited his arrival.

As Gore entered, the room fell silent, all eyes fixed on him as if expecting some profound revelation or, perhaps, a confession. I watched from a distance, my presence seemingly forgotten in the midst of this peculiar gathering, and wondered what exactly the Ministry hoped to achieve with this clandestine meeting, and what role Gore was supposed to play in their mysterious plans."

This will not only aid in their recovery but also offer valuable insights into the complexities of the human psyche, ultimately enriching our understanding of trauma and its effects on mental health. Furthermore, it's essential to recognize that each person's response to trauma is distinct, influenced by a myriad of factors including their background, support systems, and personal resilience. Therefore, a one-size-fits-all approach is not only ineffective but also potentially harmful, as it may overlook critical aspects of an individual's experience. Instead, we should strive for a more nuanced and personalized approach, one that acknowledges the complexity of human suffering and the importance of empathy and understanding in the healing process."

"We went for lunch at a small bistro near the Ministry. Gore came from an era of service à la française, private dining rooms and putting everything into jelly. When I began to","explain, in tones of motherly patience, how twenty-first-century restaurants operated, he said, “I’ve eaten kangaroo on the uninhabited shores of the Albert River.

The waiter, noticing my confusion, approached our table with a charming smile and began to explain the daily specials, his French accent adding to the ambiance of the bistro. As we waited for our food to arrive, Gore regaled me with stories of his time in the service industry, recounting tales of lavish dinner parties and high-society gatherings, where the art of fine dining was a cornerstone of etiquette and refinement. His eyes sparkled with nostalgia as he spoke, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of fascination with the bygone era he described, one that seemed to be rapidly disappearing in the face of modernity and changing culinary trends. The arrival of our food interrupted Gore's reminiscences, and we spent the next hour savoring our meals and engaging in conversation that flowed effortlessly, touching on topics ranging from the nuances of wine pairings to the challenges of maintaining traditional cooking techniques in a contemporary setting."
"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to",take us to”—here he raised his eyebrows—“a public house.

The moon was full, casting an eerie glow over the deserted square, and the only sound was the distant hooting of an owl, which seemed to echo the beating of my heart. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows, and I recognized the bridge, dressed in a long, flowing cloak, her face obscured by a hood. Without a word, she beckoned me to follow her, and I trailed behind, my senses on high alert, as we made our way through the winding streets, the silence between us thick with anticipation and foreboding."
"Back at the house I was still struggling to think of as “home,” Gore shyly asked me if I would also “come for a drink.” He had done well, at lunch, to hide his deep embarrassment over my payment",of the bill (with a Ministry expense card); he was adjusting with gold-star alacrity in recognizing that it wouldn’t be a reputation-detonating act for a respectable woman to be seen in a public house in the company of bachelors.,"of the debt, and I could tell that he was genuinely trying to make an effort to move past the awkwardness that had settled between us.

Gore ordered us each a whiskey, and as we sat down at a small table by the window, I noticed the way he seemed to relax in my presence, his shoulders easing down from their defensive posture. The conversation flowed easily, and I found myself laughing and joking with him in a way that felt surprisingly natural. As the night wore on, I began to see Gore in a different light, as a complex and multifaceted person rather than just the embodiment of my financial obligations. And though I still had my reservations, I couldn't deny the spark of connection that had been ignited between us, a spark that I couldn't help but wonder might grow into something more."

The encounter left me feeling drained and disheartened, a stark reminder of the deep-seated biases and prejudices that still lingered in our society, waiting to be confronted and overcome."
"He smiled, dimples curving. “I think, as we are ‘housemates,’","and also, I hope, friends, that you should call me Graham.”",it would be only proper for us to get to know each other a bit,21,"it would be only proper for us to get to know each other a bit better, don't you agree, perhaps over a cup of coffee or dinner sometime this week, and I must say, I'm rather curious about what brought you to this place, and what you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking."
"“After you returned home yesterday, the Brigadier came back to see Arthur. They had a conversation","about television, which Arthur seems to think is a wonderful invention. The Brigadier mentioned ‘Auntie’s output.’ ”","that seemed to have left a lasting impression on both of them, as Arthur appeared rather contemplative and withdrawn",33,"that seemed to have left a lasting impression on both of them, as Arthur appeared rather contemplative and withdrawn for the remainder of the evening, and the Brigadier's expression was grave with concern, his eyes clouded by the weight of unspoken thoughts, which only added to the sense of unease that had been building up over the past few days, and it wasn't until much later, when the house had grown quiet and the darkness outside seemed to press in on them from all sides, that Arthur finally began to open up about the details of their conversation, his voice low and hesitant as he recounted the Brigadier's words, which had apparently been laced with a sense of urgency and foreboding."

The injury had been severe, but he had been fortunate to receive prompt medical attention, and after a lengthy recovery, he had been able to regain use of his hand, albeit with some lingering stiffness and pain. Despite this, he had continued to pursue his passion for discovery, undeterred by the risks involved, and had gone on to participate in many more expeditions, each one presenting its own unique challenges and opportunities for growth. As he sat now, reflecting on his past, he couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him, remembering the thrill of adventure and the camaraderie of his fellow explorers, and he knew that those experiences had shaped him into the person he was today."
"It’s surprising, then, that I allowed Graham’s drawing of the projection device to enter my files as a joke, like a coin minted 70 BC. I thought it was a form of juvenilia, drawn in","his earliest years as a modern man, something to remind him of on a significant anniversary of his arrival here; and not, as it would turn out to be, a red letter from another era.","the margins of a notebook, a fleeting expression of adolescent imagination, devoid of any real significance or substance.

But as I delved deeper into the mysteries of the device, I began to realize that Graham's drawing was more than just a careless doodle. It was a blueprint, a map to a hidden world that existed beyond the confines of our mundane reality. The lines and curves that danced across the page seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy, as if they were trying to convey a message that only the most attuned could decipher. I found myself becoming increasingly obsessed with the drawing, pouring over it for hours, searching for clues and hidden meanings that might unlock the secrets of the projection device. And then, one fateful night, I stumbled upon an unusual symbol etched into the corner of the page, a symbol that seemed to match the markings on an ancient artifact I had discovered in a long-forgotten archive. The connection was too striking to ignore, and I knew that I had to investigate further, to follow the thread of curiosity that Graham's drawing had so tantalizingly dangled before me."
"By the start of that summer, Graham was practically a native of the era. He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle. Most mornings he rose—hours before me—and",went for a run. He would sometimes wake me up with a juicy smoker’s wheeze on his return to the house. He started giving me custody of his cigarettes and enforced a predinner smoking ban.,"would quietly make his way to the kitchen, where he'd brew a pot of coffee and sit at the table, sipping it slowly as he stared out the window at the gradually brightening sky. The stillness",70,"would quietly make his way to the kitchen, where he'd brew a pot of coffee and sit at the table, sipping it slowly as he stared out the window at the gradually brightening sky. The stillness of those early morning hours seemed to suit him, and I often wondered what thoughts occupied his mind during that solitary time, whether he was reflecting on the vast differences between this life and the one he'd left behind, or simply enjoying the peacefulness of the moment. As the days turned into weeks, I grew accustomed to his gentle presence, and our conversations, though still somewhat stilted, began to feel more natural, like we were both slowly finding our footing in this strange, shared world. The way he'd carefully observe the smallest details, from the way the sunlight filtered through the blinds to the sound of birds chirping outside, was almost endearing, and I found myself looking forward to our daily interactions, eager to see what new discovery he'd made or what insight he'd gained from his observations of this era, so foreign to him yet so familiar to me."
"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past. I was prickly and defensive about","this; I could not look at why directly. I heard the way I spoke to him about it: adjustment, reasonable, citizen, responsibility, values. He blew a lot of pensive cigarette smoke at me.","the modern world, feeling like it was constantly being judged and found wanting by Graham's nostalgic gaze.

His aversion to technology, his preference for traditional clothing, and his old-fashioned mannerisms all seemed like a personal rejection of the life I had built for myself. I couldn't help but wonder if he would ever be able to fully accept me, or if his loyalty to the past would always create a barrier between us. As I watched him navigate the complexities of contemporary society, I felt a pang of sadness, knowing that he would never truly belong, and that a part of him would always remain rooted in a bygone era. Despite this, I was drawn to his old-world charm, and the way he seemed to carry himself with a quiet confidence that was both captivating and intimidating. I found myself wanting to understand him, to uncover the secrets of his past and to help him find a place in the world that felt like home. But as I delved deeper into his life, I began to realize that Graham's story was far more complex than I could have ever imagined, and that his struggles with the twenty-first century were only the tip of the iceberg."
"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them. Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled","to focus on the tests—eyes moving rapidly. I once found him the sole occupant of the fifth-floor smoking area (a pigeon-shit-encrusted balcony), methodically shredding a filter of a finished cigarette. I watched him for a while, interested in the way that only his fingers moved.

The researchers soon realized that they needed to change the environment to get more accurate results, so they decided to conduct the tests in a more neutral setting, such as a conference room or a cozy living room. This change of scenery seemed to help, as the expats began to relax and respond more naturally to the tests. However, the researchers soon encountered another challenge: the expats' cultural backgrounds and personal experiences influenced their reactions to the tests, making it difficult to establish a baseline for empathy and disgust. For instance, what one expat found disgusting, another might find perfectly normal. The researchers had to take this into account and adapt their tests to accommodate the diversity of the expat group. As the tests continued, the researchers started to notice some interesting patterns and correlations, which they hoped would eventually lead to a deeper understanding of the complex emotions they were studying. Despite the challenges, the expats remained cooperative and curious, eager to learn more about themselves and their emotional responses. The tests became a fascinating journey of self-discovery for them, and they began to see the world in a different light, as a complex tapestry of emotions and experiences that were unique to each individual. The researchers, too, were learning valuable lessons, not just about empathy and disgust, but also about the importance of cultural sensitivity and the need to approach their subjects with compassion and understanding. As the study progressed, it became clear that the expats were not just participants, but also active contributors, sharing their insights and perspectives to help the researchers refine their understanding of the human emotional experience."
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too. Even Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had","fought in large-scale battles, were laid out by the ultramodern scope of the harm.

As the days went by, the tension in the group grew, and the relationships between the expats started to fray. Nineteen-sixteen's sedation had an unexpected side effect, causing her to experience vivid and disturbing flashbacks to the war. The others tried to be supportive, but they were struggling with their own emotions, and the atmosphere in the group became increasingly volatile. Graham, who had always been the voice of reason, found himself at a loss for words, unable to comfort his fellow expats or make sense of the chaos that had erupted. The empathy exams, which were meant to bring the group closer together, had ultimately driven them further apart, and it seemed that the damage might be irreparable."
"Adela was always present at the honesty exams, often intervening in them. I got the impression that she was listening to offstage prompts that only she could","hear, being the only one among us who was aware she was on a stage, and was trying to chivvy us along the right course of action.","hear, guiding her actions with an uncanny intuition that sometimes made the examiners themselves feel like pawns in a game they didn't",54,"hear, guiding her actions with an uncanny intuition that sometimes made the examiners themselves feel like pawns in a game they didn't fully understand.

The students, too, seemed to sense this, their eyes often darting towards her as they answered questions, seeking some hidden cue or reassurance that only Adela could provide. Despite the initial skepticism, her interventions often led to surprising revelations, uncovering truths that had been skillfully concealed. It was as if Adela possessed a unique ability to see beyond the façade, to the very heart of the matter, and her role in the honesty exams became increasingly pivotal, making one wonder what the true purpose of these exams was and what Adela's ultimate goal might be."
"Adela smiled with about a third of her mouth. Her face had changed again. She looked pinched and hungry,",and hauntingly as if her skin was held in place by a bulldog clip at the back of her skull.,"and her eyes seemed to hold a deep sadness, as if the weight of her own secrets and desires",39,"and her eyes seemed to hold a deep sadness, as if the weight of her own secrets and desires was slowly consuming her from the inside out, leaving behind a fragile and vulnerable exterior that threatened to shatter at any moment, revealing the turmoil that churned beneath the surface of her carefully crafted facade, a facade that had been so meticulously constructed to conceal the true depths of her emotions and the unspoken longings that haunted her every waking moment."
"I went along to one of the earliest dinners, chicken bag slung over my shoulder. Bridges tended not to eat at the Ministry canteen with administrative staff and the operators on the Wellness team—the office-based employees—and the decorous hostility with which the paper pushers met me was adorable. When I got to the","kitchen itself, the first thing I saw was Graham leaning down to light a cigarette on the gas ring, his curls dangerously close to the hob.

The conversation was stilted at first, but as the night wore on and the wine flowed, the atmosphere began to relax, and I found myself laughing and joking with the team like I had been a part of it for years. It was a welcome respite from the tension that seemed to permeate every aspect of my work at the Ministry, and I felt a sense of belonging that I hadn't experienced since my first day on the job. As the evening drew to a close, I realized that I had been so caught up in the conversation that I had forgotten all about the chicken bag slung over my shoulder, and I made a mental note to grab a snack on the way back to my apartment, feeling grateful for the unexpected camaraderie and the promise of a brighter tomorrow."
"She put a glass down in front of me—ice, water, an oily suggestion of cordial, and,","sure enough, some fussy edible garnishes. I blinked at it and then at Margaret, who smiled.",a slice of lemon that seemed to glow with an otherworldly light in the dimly lit atmosphere,32,"a slice of lemon that seemed to glow with an otherworldly light in the dimly lit atmosphere of the old tavern, where the air was thick with the smell of smoke and worn leather, and the patrons spoke in hushed tones as if sharing secrets that only these walls could keep, their faces illuminated only by the faint flicker of candles that cast eerie shadows on the walls, making it seem as though the very spirits of the past were gathered around us, watching and waiting to see what would unfold next."
"Graham said, “Hm!” and pulled hard on his cigarette. He wandered off with the expansive air of a man who might pick up some parsley, not because",he has been told to but because that might be a jolly thing to do en route to his next footloose and fancy-free destination.

The worries of his daily life seemed to fade away with each step, and he found himself lost in the rhythm of the market, where the only concern was the present moment. His eyes wandered over the vibrant stalls, taking in the colorful array of fruits and vegetables on display, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of contentment wash over him. The world, for a brief moment, seemed like a more manageable and peaceful place, and Graham reveled in the tranquility that had settled over him, savoring the taste of his cigarette and the gentle hum of the market."
"“No,” said Margaret. She shrugged at my expression. “An’ I forsake this duty,” she said, “we’ll sicken. Forty-seven",thinks tobacco is an herb.

The Brigadier drifted closer. He did look hungry. He looked like I did as a student when I ate nothing but buttered,toast and apples.

As he drew closer, I could see the fine lines etched into his face, the deep creases that spoke of a life lived hard and fast, of struggles and hardships that had taken their toll on his body and mind. And yet, despite the air of desperation that clung to him, there was something else there, something that seemed to burn within him, a spark of determination that refused to be extinguished, a flame that flickered with a fierce and unyielding intensity."

"Movement was anathema. I slept, mostly, naked and poaching in my sweat. The water ration forced Graham to switch finally to thirty-second showers.

I felt like I was trapped in a never-ending nightmare, with no escape from the sweltering temperatures and the isolation that came with them. As the hours ticked by, I began to feel like a prisoner in my own home, longing for the freedom to step outside and feel the coolness of the night air on my skin. But for now, I was stuck, trapped in this sweltering purgatory, waiting for the heat wave to break and the world to return to some semblance of normalcy."
"Adela took bridge meetings in a soundproof room deep in the Ministry’s chest. She always arrived first, and we’d find her sitting at the top of",a long table like a mannequin awaiting the gift of demonic possession.

The room itself was a marvel of modern technology, with walls lined with screens that could display anything from real-time data streams to simulated environments, all designed to facilitate the delicate dance of international diplomacy. As we entered, Adela would nod curtly, her eyes never leaving the screens as she began to outline the day's agenda, her voice crisp and authoritative, leaving no doubt as to who was in charge. The air was thick with tension, the fate of nations hanging precariously in the balance, and yet, despite the gravity of the situation, Adela exuded an aura of calm, a sense of quiet confidence that was both reassuring and intimidating. As the meetings progressed, the room would grow thick with the smell of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of the screens, a constant reminder of the high stakes and the delicate balance of power that hung in the balance, waiting to be tipped one way or the other by the words and actions of the people gathered around that table."
Adela was standing at the sink and anarchically disobeying the water ration by running her wrists under cold,"water.

"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it,","was a mystery.

Her condescending attitude and sharp tongue made her few friends, and many wondered how someone so clearly ill-suited to a role that required diplomacy and tact had managed to secure such a prominent position. As the days turned into weeks, Adela's behavior became increasingly erratic, and her interactions with colleagues grew more strained, leading to a palpable sense of tension that hung in the air like a challenge, waiting to be addressed. Despite her prickly demeanor, there were whispers of a deeper vulnerability, a sense that Adela was struggling to keep her own demons at bay, and that her harsh exterior was merely a facade, a fragile shield designed to protect her from the slings and arrows of a world that seemed determined to bring her down. As we navigated the complex web of office politics, it became clear that Adela's story was far more nuanced than initially met the eye, and that the truth behind her enigmatic presence would only be revealed with time, patience, and a willingness to look beyond the surface level."
"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had","just discovered that a woman with whom he was spending a lot of time would never be interested in him.

The way he avoided eye contact, the way his shoulders slumped in defeat, it all spoke of a story untold, a narrative that I was desperate to unravel. And so, I took a step closer, my heart pounding in anticipation, as I wondered what secrets lay hidden beneath the surface of this enigmatic stranger, and what it would take to coax them out into the open."
"Graham blew smoke out through his nose reflectively. “I see,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s fair to call him ‘grim,’ though you wouldn’t be the","first to say it. He was a severe disciplinarian, it’s true. Held grudges. But he was a very lonely person.

"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders. The bridges kept turning in their core reports, and the experiments kept running. Given how much of our working day the data collection took, we all assumed that the time-travel project was running to the stated purpose.

I tried to brush it off as mere paranoia, but the sense of unease lingered, gnawing at the back of my mind like a persistent itch. And then, one day, everything changed. Adela called a meeting with the entire team, her expression grave and solemn. ""We've received a message from the future,"" she announced, her voice barely above a whisper. ""It seems that our actions have not gone unnoticed."" The room fell silent, as if the very air had been sucked out of it. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized that we had indeed been playing with fire, and now we were about to face the consequences."
"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events.

It was as if Graham's scorn had the power to reverberate throughout the fabric of time, leaving an indelible mark on the cosmos that would forever alter the trajectory of human experience. I couldn't shake the feeling that his disdain was not just a personal quirk, but a symptom of a larger malaise that threatened to engulf us all, a sense of disillusionment that would ultimately prove catastrophic if left unchecked. As I pondered the implications of Graham's attitude, I began to realize that my own feelings of rejection were merely a microcosm of a far more profound and pervasive issue, one that spoke to the very heart of our collective disillusionment with the modern world. The twenty-first century, with all its promises of progress and innovation, seemed to have delivered only a hollow sense of disconnection and discontent, leaving us feeling unmoored and uncertain about the future. And Graham, with his atemporal contempt, was merely a harbinger of this larger sense of disillusionment, a reminder that our individual experiences were inextricably linked to the broader cultural and historical context in which we lived."
"I persuaded Graham to use the tiny office, in which I ordinarily worked, to cram for the test. The Ministry gave no indication of what format","the test would take, or what manner of questions would be asked, or tasks set.

As the days passed, he became increasingly anxious, and I could sense his frustration and desperation. I tried to reassure him that he was well-prepared, but he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was going to fail. The night before the test, Graham stayed up late, pouring over his notes and making last-minute flashcards, while I tried to get some rest, knowing that I had to be sharp for my own work the next day. Despite the chaos, I was confident that Graham would do well, and I looked forward to seeing the results and finally putting the ordeal behind us. The next morning, Graham arrived at the test center, his face set in a determined expression, and I wished him luck as he disappeared into the crowded room. As I waited for the results, I couldn't help but think about the implications of the test and how it would affect our lives, and I found myself feeling a sense of trepidation about the future."

I couldn't help but wonder what had brought this enigmatic figure to our humble auditorium, and what their story was. As I glanced back, I noticed that Salese was now standing up, her eyes fixed on the stranger with a mixture of disdain and fascination, her expression a perfect reflection of the turmoil that was brewing inside me. The room was silent, except for the sound of shuffling feet and whispered conversations, as everyone seemed to be waiting with bated breath to see what would happen next. And then, just as suddenly as it had started, the moment was over, and the stranger vanished into the crowd, leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions and unspoken emotions."

"I cycled up to the nice grocery store to buy a bottle of champagne, pausing on the way home for a soft-serve ice cream. I sat on the bench to lick the ripple into a mound and think about the","Brigadier.

With a renewed sense of anticipation, I finished my ice cream, tossed the cone into a nearby trash can, and continued my journey home, the bottle of champagne securely tucked away in my bicycle basket, ready to pop the cork and toast to new beginnings."

"When I brought the glass up—stoppering the rest of the bottle for dinner—I could hear Graham singing “I love to steal awhile away,” occasionally muffled by his drags on a cigarette. Water plashed against the tub.","He dropped to humming and presumably soaping. I slid quietly to the floor and leaned my head against the wall. I wasn’t going to see a Ministry therapist.

As I listened, I felt my own worries and cares slowly drifting away, like the wisps of steam rising from the tub, vanishing into the air. The music, the wine, and the sound of the water all blended together in a sensory tapestry that was both calming and uplifting, a perfect antidote to the stresses of the day. I took a sip of the wine, feeling the cool liquid slide down my throat, and closed my eyes, letting the peacefulness of the scene wash over me. The world outside, with all its troubles and concerns, seemed to fade into the background, and for a brief, shining moment, everything felt right with the world."
"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century.

Nevertheless, he had taken to cooking in a way he had failed to take to","television or texting or the use of deodorants (“I bathe every day,” he’d said to me with hurt dignity).

As he navigated the unfamiliar kitchen, Graham discovered that the process of cooking was not just about following a recipe, but about understanding the nuances of flavor and texture. He began to experiment with different ingredients and techniques, often with surprising results. The first time he managed to cook a decent omelette, he felt an overwhelming sense of pride, as if he had accomplished something truly remarkable. This newfound passion for cooking also led him to explore the local markets and food stores, where he encountered a vast array of exotic spices, fresh produce, and artisanal products that further fueled his culinary curiosity. As the days turned into weeks, Graham's cooking skills improved dramatically, and he found himself looking forward to the daily ritual of preparing his meals, savoring the aromas and flavors that filled his small kitchen. The act of cooking had become a source of comfort and solace, a way for him to connect with his new surroundings and find a sense of belonging in this strange and unfamiliar world. And so, Graham continued to cook, to experiment, and to explore the endless possibilities of the culinary world, finding joy and satisfaction in the simple, yet profound, act of nourishing himself."

As I watched her, I couldn't help but wonder what she was thinking, what she was feeling, as she sat there, a woman out of time, trying to make sense of a world that was both familiar and yet, utterly foreign. The men, oblivious to her inner turmoil, continued to talk, their voices rising and falling in a soothing cadence, as they discussed their latest projects, their struggles, and their triumphs, and Margaret listened, her eyes shining with a mixture of curiosity and longing, as if she was trying to find a way to bridge the gap between her own life and the lives of these men, who seemed to embody a sense of freedom and possibility that she could only dream of."
"How the topic of weed came up I couldn’t remember—probably during one of the vigorous debates about what the twenty-first century had genuinely improved, which in",the opinion of the expats was a mixed bag.

Some people cited its potential medicinal uses, while others expressed concerns about its impact on mental health and productivity. The debate was lively, with no clear consensus, but it was interesting to see how perspectives varied across different age groups and cultural backgrounds. One thing that struck me, however, was how the discussion about weed seemed to transcend generations, with everyone having an opinion, whether based on personal experience or second-hand information. It was a rare topic that could bring together such a diverse group of people, each with their own unique viewpoint, and for a moment, it felt like we were all connected by our shared curiosity and willingness to engage in open and honest dialogue."

I, too, felt myself being drawn into her orbit, my senses heightened as I struggled to understand the source of her power. Was it her beauty, her intelligence, or something more intangible? Whatever it was, I was determined to learn from her, to absorb some of her magnetism and make it my own. As the evening wore on, I found myself becoming more and more entranced, my catalog of observations growing more detailed and nuanced.

"As soon as she stepped in, I started making a tally of the evidence of unbeauty. There was a chair whose seat was filled with clothes too dirty for the wardrobe but too clean for the washing basket.

The woman's eyes scanned the room, taking in every detail, and I could sense her disapproval, her judgment. I wanted to apologize, to explain that this wasn't normally how I lived, but something about her expression made me hesitate. Instead, I stood there, frozen, as she made her way deeper into the room, her footsteps echoing off the walls. She stopped in front of the window, gazing out at the view, and I followed her gaze, taking in the dull grey sky and the rooftops of the neighboring buildings. The silence between us was oppressive, heavy with unspoken words and unresolved tensions. I knew that I needed to break it, to say something, anything, to fill the void, but my mind was a blank, unable to come up with a single coherent thought.

As we talked, I couldn't help but think about the societal pressures that had led to the development of such products, and the ways in which they reflected and reinforced certain beauty standards. Margaret listened intently, her expression thoughtful, and I wondered what she was thinking - was she considering the ways in which her own life and experiences had been shaped by these same standards, or was she simply intrigued by the novelty of it all? The conversation flowed easily from there, touching on topics ranging from the history of cosmetics to the impact of social media on modern beauty culture, and I was struck by the ways in which something as seemingly mundane as a tube of foundation could serve as a catalyst for such a wide-ranging and thought-provoking discussion."

The messages were always vague, but they left him with a sense of unease, a feeling that he was being watched and waited for. Graham tried to brush it off as mere paranoia, but the sensation lingered, making him question his decision to take the job in the first place. He had thought it would be an adventure, a chance to experience a new culture and make a difference, but now he wasn't so sure. The Ministry's grip on the expat community seemed to be tightening, and Graham wondered if he would ever be able to escape the web of surveillance and control that had been spun around him. As he walked through the crowded streets, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was living in a fishbowl, with the Ministry watching his every move, waiting for him to slip up so they could pounce. The thought sent a shiver down his spine, and he quickened his pace, anxious to lose himself in the sea of faces and find some semblance of freedom, no matter how fleeting."

The sounds of car horns, chatter, and wailing sirens in the distance served as a jarring contrast to the image of Arthur, who seemed to be lost in thought, his eyes fixed on some point in the distance, oblivious to the commotion around him. As he turned a corner, the faint scent of old books and leather wafted from his direction, further solidifying the impression that he was a relic from another time, a time when life was simpler, yet more complicated, and the world was a very different place."

If the expats were","dangerously ill, they’d be removed to the wards and never mind the trigger; if they could get a grip and deal with it at home, they should.","going to get sick, they would just have to tough it out, or so she thought, until the day she woke up with a fever that refused to break, and",54,"going to get sick, they would just have to tough it out, or so she thought, until the day she woke up with a fever that refused to break, and her usual remedies of whiskey and denial were no match for the relentless chills that wracked her body, forcing her to reconsider her stance on seeking medical attention, a notion that was further solidified when her husband, usually a paragon of stoicism, came down with a similar affliction, prompting them to reluctantly seek out the local doctor, a man rumored to have a bedside manner that was as gruff as his reputation was impressive, and whose unorthodox methods would either cure them or kill them, a risk they were willing to take, given the alternative of suffering through the illness without any respite, a decision that would ultimately prove to be a turning point in their lives, one that would challenge their long-held beliefs and force them to reevaluate their priorities, all while navigating the complex and often baffling world of expat healthcare, where the lines between traditional medicine and folk remedies were constantly blurred, and the only constant was the nagging feeling that they were in over their heads."
"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs. Given the prevalence of prostitution in Victorian England, the nonexistence of reliable barrier contraception in his era, and the fact that he was a sailor, this suggested he was either a virgin or very lucky. But then again, I knew enough about his biography to know that he was very, very lucky.","of his file from the Ministry, which included a detailed account of his psychoanalytic sessions, and it was clear that Graham's views on sex were shaped by his upbringing and the strict moral code of the Ministry.

He had been taught to view sex as a necessary but unseemly aspect of human nature, something to be acknowledged but not indulged. As a result, he seemed to regard sex with a mixture of fascination and repulsion, unsure of how to navigate the complex and often contradictory messages he had received about it. This ambivalence was reflected in his behavior, which could be both prudish and provocative at the same time. I often found myself wondering what lay beneath his reserved exterior, whether he was struggling with desires he dared not express or simply indifferent to the whole subject. Our conversations about sex were always stilted and awkward, with Graham changing the subject or falling silent whenever I tried to broach the topic. It was as if he had been conditioned to regard sex as a taboo, something that could not be discussed openly or honestly. Despite this, I sensed that he was curious, that he wanted to understand the world around him even if he couldn't fully participate in it. I decided to try and approach the subject from a different angle, to see if I could help him open up and share his thoughts and feelings about sex. I started by asking him about his views on love and relationships, hoping to find a way into the more sensitive topics. To my surprise, he responded with a depth and nuance that I hadn't expected, revealing a rich inner life and a profound longing for connection and intimacy. As we talked, I realized that Graham's mystery was not just about sex, but about the complexities of human relationships and the ways in which we struggle to express ourselves and connect with others."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory. Every time I gave Graham a book, I was trying to shunt him along a story I’d been telling myself all my life.","a certain allure to her innocence, a sense of untapped potential that made me want to share my own experiences and insights with her, to watch her eyes light up with understanding and her face glow with the excitement of discovery.

As we sat together in the small café, sipping our coffee and discussing everything from literature to music, I found myself drawn to her eagerness, her willingness to learn and absorb the world around her. It was a refreshing change from the jaded cynicism that often characterized the expat community, and I found myself looking forward to our conversations, eager to see what new ideas and perspectives she would bring to the table. But as our discussions deepened, I began to realize that there was more to Margaret than met the eye, a complexity and depth that I had not initially suspected, and I found myself wondering what secrets she might be hiding beneath her cheerful, innocent exterior. As the days turned into weeks, our friendship blossomed, and I found myself becoming increasingly invested in her life, eager to help her navigate the challenges of living abroad and to share in her joys and sorrows. And yet, despite our growing closeness, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was still something she wasn't telling me, something that lingered just beneath the surface, waiting to be revealed."
Graham was adamant about not informing the Ministry about his illness. It was the closest I had,ever seen him to entreating. I thought about it a lot. I liked being entreated by him.,"ever come to understanding the complexities of his character, and it sparked a mix of emotions",34,"ever come to understanding the complexities of his character, and it sparked a mix of emotions within me, ranging from concern for his well-being to frustration at his stubbornness, as I struggled to reconcile the man I thought I knew with the secrets he kept hidden, secrets that could potentially put not just himself, but others at risk, given the sensitive nature of our work and the high stakes involved in our line of duty, where a single misstep could have far-reaching and devastating consequences."
"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled. Then again, whose upper management am I not describing? Who trusts their workplace? Who thinks their job is on the side of right? They fed us all poison from a bottle marked “prestige,” and we developed a high tolerance for bitterness. I would have been more frightened if the pressure lifted, like an indoor cat struck by sudden rain.","and her alibis were worse, but I had no concrete evidence to back up my doubts.

As I look back, I realize that I was blinded by my own naivety and my willingness to believe in the best in people. I thought that I was being open-minded and empathetic, but in reality, I was being reckless and irresponsible. The consequences of my actions, or rather my inaction, are still haunting me to this day. I often wonder what would have happened if I had been more vigilant, more proactive, and more willing to listen to my intuition. Would the outcome have been different? Would lives have been saved? These are questions that I will never have the answers to, and they will continue to haunt me for the rest of my life. The experience has left me with a deep sense of regret and a newfound appreciation for the importance of being cautious and discerning. I can only hope that others will learn from my mistakes and be more mindful of the potential consequences of their actions."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.","for someone like me, with no formal training or experience, to have stumbled upon such a significant discovery,",39,"for someone like me, with no formal training or experience, to have stumbled upon such a significant discovery, and he pressed me for every detail, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, in the hopes of understanding the underlying mechanisms that had led to my unexpected breakthrough, and as I recounted the events leading up to it, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment, knowing that my unorthodox methods had yielded something truly remarkable, and Graham's enthusiasm was infectious, drawing me into a world of excitement and possibility, where the boundaries of conventional thinking were pushed to the limit and the thrill of the unknown beckoned like a siren's call, urging us to explore further and uncover the secrets that lay hidden, waiting to be unearthed by curious and intrepid minds like ours."
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.","his lips, his eyes fixed intently on a piece of paper in front of him, which I soon realized was a letter. The room was filled with the warm, golden light of",56,"his lips, his eyes fixed intently on a piece of paper in front of him, which I soon realized was a letter. The room was filled with the warm, golden light of the setting sun, and the air was thick with the scent of roasting meat and freshly baked bread. As I entered, Graham looked up, a hint of a smile on his face, and beckoned me to come closer. I could see the faint lines of concentration on his forehead, and his hair was slightly disheveled, as if he had been running his hands through it while deep in thought. The cigarette smoke curled lazily upwards, carrying with it the faint tang of tobacco, and I felt a sense of comfort and tranquility wash over me as I took in the cozy scene before me. As I approached the table, Graham pushed the letter across to me, his eyes sparkling with a mixture of excitement and curiosity, and I couldn't help but wonder what it was that had captured his attention so thoroughly."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers. He took in anecdotes about my childhood meals as if they would contribute to a portrait of a whole woman. He ignored the fact that mostly I cooked assorted chicken pieces on rice. I could tell him things about galangal, and he found that very profound.","equipment, his eyes narrowing as he tried to pinpoint the exact balance of sweet and spicy, the way the flavors melded together in a harmonious union.

As he cooked, the kitchen was filled with the aromas of sizzling meat and steaming vegetables, transporting me back to my childhood and the countless hours I spent watching my mother prepare meals for our family. Graham's fascination with the culinary traditions of Southeast Asia was not just about the food itself, but about the cultural context and the stories behind each dish. He would often ask me to share stories about my family's history and the role that food played in our celebrations and gatherings. As we sat down to enjoy the meals he had prepared, I was struck by the way the flavors and textures seemed to evoke a sense of community and connection, a sense of belonging to a larger tradition that transcended borders and cultures. And as we ate, Graham would sketch the dishes, trying to capture the essence of the food and the emotions it evoked, his pencil moving deftly across the paper as he sought to convey the beauty and simplicity of the culinary experience."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization. I wanted him in a role that didn’t require him to be at sea for months, possibly years,","at a time. It was too soon, I told myself.

We spent countless hours scouring job listings, attending career fairs, and networking with people in our community, all in an effort to find the perfect fit for him. As we navigated this challenging process, I couldn't help but think about the significant adjustments we had already made as a couple, from leaving behind our families and friends to adapting to a new culture and way of life. The thought of him being away for extended periods, serving in a navy that was vastly different from the one he once knew, was daunting, and I worried about the potential strain it could put on our relationship. I knew that finding a job that aligned with his passions and values, while also providing a sense of stability and security, was crucial for our future together. With each passing day, the pressure to make a decision mounted, and I could sense his growing frustration and uncertainty. Despite the challenges, we remained committed to supporting each other, and I was determined to help him find a career path that would bring him fulfillment and allow us to build a life together, free from the stresses and anxieties of his previous role."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.","The soulful melody and harmonies filled the room, creating a stark contrast to the tense atmosphere that had settled over the group, and for a moment, everyone seemed to forget about their differences,",64,"The soulful melody and harmonies filled the room, creating a stark contrast to the tense atmosphere that had settled over the group, and for a moment, everyone seemed to forget about their differences, lost in the nostalgic sound that evoked memories of a bygone era, one that was simpler and less complicated. As the music played on, it was as if time itself had slowed down, allowing them to momentarily escape the weight of their responsibilities and the uncertainty that lay ahead. The song's themes of love and longing seemed to take on a deeper meaning in this context, and Graham, noticing the effect it was having, let it play on, hoping the music could somehow bridge the gaps between them and bring a sense of unity to the fractured group. But as the final notes of the song faded away, reality set back in, and the silence that followed was a harsh reminder of the challenges they still faced, and the difficult decisions that had to be made."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes. One of his first searches was charmingly housewifely: “Most challenging recipes”; “How to make cheese soufflé”; “What is miso paste?”; “Where to buy miso paste”; “How long has Japan been open to Europe?” A day or so after I’d read this report, I received another that listed the following search terms:","and that his late-night browsing sessions would uncover a plethora of disturbing and explicit content, leaving me to wonder how I could possibly address such issues with him.

I couldn't help but think about the potential repercussions on our working relationship and the overall dynamics of our team, and I found myself questioning whether I was truly prepared to handle such a sensitive and delicate matter. As the days went by, my apprehension grew, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was walking on thin ice, waiting for the inevitable moment when I would have to confront Graham about his online behavior and face the possibility of an extremely uncomfortable and potentially explosive conversation. The weight of responsibility rested heavily on my shoulders, and I couldn't help but wonder if I was truly equipped to deal with the fallout that might ensue, or if I would end up making things worse by trying to intervene. The uncertainty and anticipation were suffocating, and I couldn't help but feel like I was trapped in a precarious situation, with no clear escape route in sight."
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing,","as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday. This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option. We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit. Still, we had not told them about the death camps.","but to me, it just looked like a desperate attempt to hold back the inevitable.

The sound of laughter and chatter was a thin veneer, a brave face put on by people who were secretly scared. I quickened my pace, my heart racing with anticipation, as I made my way through the flooded streets to check on my own home. The water was already lapping at the doorstep, and I knew I had to act fast if I was to save my belongings from the deluge. I grabbed a sandbag and began to barricade the door, my hands moving swiftly as I tried to stem the tide. But despite my best efforts, I couldn't shake the feeling that it was already too late, that the floodwaters would soon overwhelm us all. As I worked, I caught glimpses of my neighbors, all of us united in our struggle against the rising waters. There was Mrs. Jenkins, her silver hair plastered to her head, as she desperately tried to save her garden; and Mr. Thompson, his face set in a determined grimace, as he battled to keep the water out of his shop. It was a surreal scene, like something out of a disaster movie, and yet it was all too real. The floodwaters were a reminder of the power of nature, a force that we could hardly comprehend, let alone control. And as I stood there, up to my knees in water, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the sheer scale of it all."

Suddenly, the silence in the room was shattered by the sound of Rogue Male's labored breathing, and I felt a jolt of fear as I realized that he wasn't dead after all. I took a step back, my eyes fixed on the prone figure, as a creeping sense of dread began to seep into my bones. What was happening? And what was that thing inside me, kicking and squirming like a living entity?
