"Not quite the stuff of childhood dreams. Then again, I’m no dreamer. I only ever contemplated marriage once, back in the gloomy days of my childhood.

The harsh realities of my upbringing had instilled in me a sense of pragmatism, a belief that love was a luxury I could ill afford. And yet, as I navigated the complexities of adulthood, I began to realize that perhaps I had been wrong to dismiss the idea of marriage so readily. The notion of having a partner, someone to share the burdens and joys of life with, began to take on a new appeal. But it was a notion that I approached with caution, wary of repeating the mistakes of my past and unsure if I was truly ready to open myself up to the vulnerabilities that came with loving someone else."
"That was fourteen years ago, though, and Serena never married me. In fact, she’s long gone.

The memories of our time together linger, a bittersweet reminder of what could have been if fate had dealt us a different hand. I often find myself wandering the empty halls of my apartment, haunted by the ghosts of our past, and wondering what became of the girl who once captured my heart. The city outside is bustling with life, but in here, time stands still, frozen in the moment when Serena walked out the door, leaving me with a shattered dream and a deep sense of longing that refuses to subside. As the years go by, the pain has dulled, but the ache remains, a constant reminder of the love we shared, and the future we never got to build together."

They assured me that it was just a normal part of the wedding process and that I would likely exchange a few pleasantries with my soon-to-be spouse before the ceremony, but I couldn't shake off the feeling of anxiety that had been building up inside me. I had always been a private person, and the thought of having to make small talk with someone I barely knew, in front of a crowd of people, was daunting to say the least. As the days went by, I found myself becoming increasingly withdrawn, unable to focus on the upcoming wedding and all the joy it was supposed to bring. My mind kept wandering back to the awkward encounter that awaited me, and I couldn't help but wonder if I was making a huge mistake. The pressure to put on a happy face and pretend that everything was fine was starting to take a toll on me, and I began to feel like I was losing myself in the process. I knew I needed to find a way to calm my nerves and get a grip on my emotions, but as the wedding day drew closer, I couldn't help but feel like I was running out of time."

The agent, a stern-looking woman with a clipboard, eyes us warily, her hand resting on the grip of her stun gun, a habitual gesture that speaks to the tension that always seems to simmer just below the surface in these interactions. As we wait, I take the opportunity to glance around, taking in the opulent decorations that adorn the walls and ceiling of the foyer, a jarring contrast to the stark, utilitarian aesthetic that prevails in the rest of the city. The sound of muted voices and shuffling footsteps echoes from beyond the doors, growing louder with each passing moment, and I can feel my anxiety spiking in anticipation of the meeting to come, my mind racing with all the possible outcomes and scenarios that could play out. Suddenly, the agent's comms device crackles to life, and she nods curtly, stepping aside to allow us to pass, her expression a mask of formal courtesy. ""The Council is ready for you now,"" she says, her voice dripping with an unctuous deference that only serves to heighten my unease."

"The first things I notice are the two walls of windows, which is exactly what Father wants.

The walls of windows in Father's new study are a testament to this, allowing the warm, golden light of the setting sun to filter in and dance across the room, casting a gentle, ethereal glow over the space. It's a clever design, one that acknowledges our unique needs while also showcasing the beauty of the world outside. As I step further into the room, I notice the plush, velvet drapes that can be drawn to block out the light when necessary, and the carefully placed mirrors that reflect and amplify the available light, creating a sense of brightness and airiness. The overall effect is one of understated elegance, a perfect blend of form and function that reflects Father's refined taste and attention to detail. I can almost imagine him sitting at the large, ornate desk, surrounded by his books and papers, basking in the warm, golden light as he works. It's a peaceful, serene scene, one that fills me with a sense of comfort and belonging. And yet, as I look around the room, I'm also aware of the subtle hints of Vampyre culture that are woven throughout the design, the small touches that speak to our unique history and traditions. It's a delicate balance, one that requires a deep understanding of our needs and preferences, and I'm impressed by the way Father has managed to achieve it. As I continue to explore the room, I notice the intricate carvings on the wooden paneling, the subtle patterns and symbols that reflect our mythology and folklore. It's a beautiful, nuanced space, one that feels both deeply personal and profoundly Vampyre. I can feel the weight of our history and culture in every detail, every carefully chosen element that reflects our values and traditions. And as I stand there, surrounded by the beauty and elegance of Father's new study, I'm filled with a sense of pride and connection to my heritage, a sense of belonging to a community that is both ancient and timeless."
"“Whose? Yours? Are you going to . . .” I don’t bother finishing the sentence—the sheer thought is ludicrous. It’s not just weddings that have gone out of fashion hundreds of years ago, but the entire idea","of long-term relationships. As it turns out, when your species sucks at producing children, encouraging sexual walkabouts and the search for reproductively compatible partners takes precedence over romance.

The concept of dedicating one's life to another person, through thick and thin, seems almost archaic now. People have become so focused on their own personal growth and individual pursuits that the idea of sacrificing for someone else appears quaint, even foolish. The world has changed so much that even the notion of a long-term partnership is seen as a relic of the past, a reminder of a bygone era when people were more naive and less self-aware. As I stand there, trying to process the absurdity of the situation, I am struck by the realization that our society has evolved to prioritize independence and self-reliance above all else, leaving little room for the kind of vulnerability and trust that a romantic relationship requires. The thought sends a shiver down my spine, and I am left wondering what the future holds for humanity, now that the very fabric of our emotional connections seems to be unraveling before our eyes."

The music from their phones and the sound of their voices carried across the river, mingling with the night air. But as the hours slipped by, the group's excitement began to wane, and they realized they were farther from the shore than they had intended. The darkness seemed to close in around them, and the water, which had seemed so inviting just hours before, now appeared ominous and deep. It was then that they noticed a figure standing on the riverbank, watching them. At first, they thought it might be a park ranger or a police officer, but as they drew closer, they saw it was a woman, her long hair blowing in the wind, her eyes fixed intently on them. She didn't seem to be doing anything, just standing there, but there was something unnerving about her presence. Abel, feeling a shiver run down his spine, suggested they head back to shore, but as they turned the boat around, they realized that the woman was now gone. The group exchanged nervous glances, wondering if they had really seen her at all. It wasn't until they were back on dry land, walking away from the river, that they heard the whisper. It was soft and low, but it sent chills down their spines. ""You shouldn't be here,"" it seemed to say. And then, everything went black."

However, we are pretty useless in the middle of the day, even inside.","Lethargic and weak and crawly and headachy, especially during late spring and summer, when the rays hit at that pesky steep angle. “This crepuscularity of yours is really cramping my brunch lifestyle,” Serena used to say. “Also, the fact that you don’t eat.”","Our skin is extremely sensitive to the ultraviolet rays, and even with the protection of windows or heavy curtains, we can feel our energy being drained away, leaving us lethargic and disoriented.

It's not uncommon for us to spend our days holed up in dark, quiet spaces, waiting for the sun to set and the world to transform into a more hospitable place. The night, with its soft, silvery light, is when we come alive, our senses heightened and our powers at their peak. We move unseen, our footsteps quiet on the pavement, as we go about our business, whether that's hunting, socializing, or simply enjoying the freedom that the darkness brings. And yet, despite the limitations that sunlight imposes on us, we've learned to adapt, to find ways to navigate the human world without being detected, to live alongside them without being discovered. It's a delicate balancing act, one that requires patience, cunning, and a deep understanding of the world and its rhythms. But for us, it's a small price to pay for the gift of immortality, for the chance to experience the world in all its beauty and complexity, to watch civilizations rise and fall, and to leave our own mark on the passage of time."

"“It will be different here.” Her eyes move from mine and trace the contours of the room, still a mess of moving boxes and piles of clothes. Her gaze hiccups on the bare mattress, now stripped of the sheets and blankets that I dragged inside the closet, then stops on the only thing I put up on the wall: a Polaroid of me and Serena","looking away from the camera during that sunset lake tour we did two years ago. Some guy took it without asking, while we were dangling our feet in the water. Then he showed it to us and said he’d only return it if one of us gave him our number.

I can almost see the memories she's trying to conjure up, the ones we made together in this very room, now tainted by the uncertainty that hangs in the air like a challenge. The silence between us grows thicker, a palpable entity that presses against my skin, making my heart beat faster. I want to reach out, to bridge the gap that's forming between us, but my hands feel heavy, as if rooted to the spot. She turns back to me, her eyes searching for something, a glimmer of reassurance perhaps, or a promise that things will indeed be different here. I try to offer her a smile, but it feels forced, a weak attempt to mask the doubts that are creeping in. The room, once a symbol of our new beginning, now feels like a battleground, a space where our past and present are colliding in a messy, unpredictable dance. As we stand there, suspended in this fragile moment, I realize that the real challenge lies not in the external circumstances, but in the unspoken fears and expectations that we've brought with us, the ones that threaten to derail our fragile attempt at a fresh start."
"No shit. “And I don’t know you enough to make a judgment. Your jeans are cool,","though.” Riveting conversation, but I’m about to pass out.

"The corner of my eye catches a hint of movement. I turn, half expecting Ana to make","a comeback, but it’s just Serena’s goddamned fucking cat, stretching his way out from under the bed.","an appearance, but instead, I'm met with an empty space where she once stood, the only sign of her presence",34,"an appearance, but instead, I'm met with an empty space where she once stood, the only sign of her presence being the faint scent of her perfume lingering in the air, a subtle reminder that she was indeed there, and the soft whisper of her voice still echoing in my mind, leaving me wondering if I had just imagined the whole encounter, or if she had truly been standing beside me, her presence as elusive as a summer breeze on a warm evening, and as I stand there, frozen in uncertainty, the world around me begins to stir, the sounds of the city slowly seeping back into my consciousness, a cacophony of car horns, chatter, and wailing sirens that serves as a jarring reminder of the reality that I've been trying to escape, and I'm left standing there, feeling lost and alone, with only my thoughts to keep me company, and the haunting question of what just happened, echoing in my mind like a mantra, refusing to be silenced."
"Growing up collecting attempted murders like milk teeth tempered me and taught me to be calm under pressure. And yet I still remember it, that first churning twist in my stomach when Serena didn’t","turn up to my place for laundry night. Didn’t reply to my texts. Didn’t pick up the phone. Didn’t call in sick to work, and simply stopped showing up.

The hours ticked by at a glacial pace, each one stretching out like an eternity, as I waited with bated breath for any sign of her. It was as if time itself had warped and distorted, leaving me suspended in a state of perpetual uncertainty. And then, just when I thought I couldn't take it anymore, the door creaked open and Serena walked in, her eyes sunken and her skin pale, but alive. The relief that washed over me was palpable, a wave of emotion that threatened to engulf me whole. But even as I felt a sense of gratitude and thankfulness, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that Serena was hiding something from me. It was a feeling that would stay with me for a long time, a nagging sense of unease that would eventually become all too familiar."
"“A few days? She still wouldn’t let the little asshole starve,” I hurried to add, but the officer had already dropped his pen. And even though I went back to the station three times that week, and eventually managed to get a missing person report filed, no one did anything","to find Serena. The hazard, I guess, of being alone in the world: no one to care that she was safe, and healthy, and alive. No one but me, and I didn’t count. I shouldn’t have been surprised, and I wasn’t. But apparently I still had the capacity to feel hurt.","to investigate further, and it seemed as though the case had fallen through the cracks of a system that was already overburdened and underfunded.

The lack of progress was infuriating, and I found myself growing more and more desperate as the days turned into weeks. I began to scour the neighborhood, posting flyers and talking to anyone who would listen, hoping that someone might have seen or heard something that could lead me to her. But every lead ended in a dead end, and I was starting to lose hope. The officer's initial skepticism had been frustrating, but it was nothing compared to the feeling of being completely ignored by the system. I started to wonder if anyone was taking my concerns seriously, or if I was just a nuisance to be tolerated. As the weeks turned into months, I became more and more withdrawn, unable to shake the feeling that I had failed her in some fundamental way. The guilt and anxiety were suffocating, and I couldn't help but wonder what had really happened to her, and whether I would ever find out. The not knowing was the hardest part, the constant uncertainty that hung over me like a cloud, refusing to lift. I felt like I was trapped in a never-ending nightmare, and I didn't know how to wake up."
"Because no one cared whether I was safe, or healthy, or alive. No one but Serena. The sister of my heart,","if not of my blood.

But even Serena's love and devotion could not shield me from the harsh realities of my existence, and I often found myself wondering if I would ever find a place where I truly belonged, or if I would be forever doomed to drift through life, unmoored and unloved."
"I had the keys, after all. Because the key to everything is but a line of code. I was able to rifle through her bank statements, IP addresses, cell phone locations. Herald emails, metadata, app usage. Serena was a journalist, one who","wrote about delicate financial stuff, and the most likely option was that she’d gotten embroiled in something fishy while working on a story, but I wasn’t going to exclude other possibilities. So I went through everything, and found . . . nothing.","had a knack for uncovering secrets, but it seemed she had left a trail of her own digital footprints behind.

As I delved deeper into her online activities, I discovered a pattern of encrypted messages and clandestine meetings. It appeared she was investigating a high-stakes story, one that involved corrupt government officials and corporate espionage. The more I learned, the more I realized that Serena's disappearance was not just a simple case of a missing person, but a complex web of intrigue and deception. I found myself drawn into the mystery, determined to uncover the truth behind her vanishing and the secrets she had uncovered. The line between journalist and hacker began to blur as I continued to dig, following a digital trail that led me down a rabbit hole of conspiracy and danger. With each new discovery, I felt a sense of trepidation, wondering if I was getting close to the truth, and if I was ready for the consequences that came with it."
"And that’s when I did it: I kneeled in front of Serena’s damn fucking cat. He was playing like he always did after dinner, pawing at a crumpled receipt in a corner of the living room, but managed to squeeze a couple of hisses into his busy schedule just for me. “Listen.” I swallowed. Rubbed my","hand on my chest and then even slapped it, trying to dull the ache. “I know you only knew her for a few days, but I really, really . . .” I scrunched my eyes shut.

I took a deep breath and continued, ""I promise I'm not going to hurt you, and I'll even give you some of that fancy cat food you like so much if you just calm down and let me pet you."" Mr. Whiskers seemed to consider my offer, his tail twitching back and forth as he weighed his options. After a moment, he appeared to decide that I was tolerable, and he began to creep closer, his ears perked up and his whiskers twitching with curiosity. I held my breath, hoping that I hadn't misread the situation, and slowly reached out a hand to pet him. To my surprise, he began to purr, nuzzling my hand gently as I stroked his soft fur. It was a small victory, but it felt like a significant breakthrough, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of hope that maybe, just maybe, I could win over Serena's heart as well."
"The receipt, which wasn’t a balled-up receipt at all. It was a piece of paper","torn from a journal, or perhaps a notebook, or—no. A planner.

"Or maybe not quite. A distant bell rang, reminding me of a game Serena and I used to play as kids, a primitive substitution cipher we made up to gossip freely in front of our caregivers. We’d named it the butterfly alphabet, and","it mostly consisted of adding b- and f- syllables to normal words. Nothing complicated: even rusty as I was, it took my brain only a few seconds to untangle it. And once I was done, I had something.

The butterfly alphabet had been our secret code, a way for us to communicate without fear of being overheard or understood by others. We had used it to share our deepest secrets, our hopes and dreams, and our fears. As I stood there, lost in thought, I felt a sudden urge to reach out to Serena, to see if she still remembered the game we used to play, and to share with her the thoughts and feelings that had been bottled up inside me for so long. I took a deep breath, and began to think of a message, one that would be simple yet meaningful, a way to reconnect with my old friend and see if our bond was still strong. The words began to form in my mind, and I smiled to myself as I thought of the look on Serena's face when she would finally decipher the code, and understand the message that I was sending her. It was a message of friendship, of nostalgia, and of the memories that we had shared together, and I knew that it would bring a smile to her face, and a sense of wonder to her heart."

I couldn't help but wonder if I had somehow provoked her or if she was just a product of my own fevered imagination. The uncertainty was suffocating, making it hard for me to breathe, and I found myself questioning my own sanity. I knew I had to talk to someone about what had happened, but the fear of being ridiculed or dismissed kept me silent. The weight of the secret bore down on me, threatening to consume me whole, and I couldn't help but feel like I was living in a nightmare from which I couldn't wake up. The days that followed were a blur, as I struggled to come to terms with the experience, and it wasn't until I stumbled upon an old diary hidden away in my attic that I began to unravel the mystery of the old hag and her true intentions."

For a moment, I forget to be afraid, forget to be defensive, and simply stand there, frozen under the weight of his scrutiny. Then, his expression changes, his eyes flashing with a hint of curiosity, and he takes a step closer, his voice dropping to a low, husky whisper.

"There might be something stunted about me.

Serena, on the other hand, thrived in this new environment, effortlessly making friends and connections that seemed to come so naturally to her. She would introduce me to her new acquaintances, and I would smile and nod, trying to keep up with the small talk, but my mind would often wander, wondering what it was about me that made me so different. Was it the way I was raised, the isolation of our Collateral term, or was it something more inherent, a fundamental aspect of my personality that made me feel like an outsider looking in? These questions swirled in my head as I watched Serena dance through life with ease, her confidence and charisma drawing people to her like a magnet. I, on the other hand, felt like a ghost hovering on the periphery, struggling to find my place in a world that seemed to be moving at a pace I couldn't quite keep up with."

The smell of charcoal and burgers wafted through the air, mingling with the sound of children's giggles and the occasional clinking of glasses, creating a sense of warmth and camaraderie that I couldn't quite grasp. Serena, ever the gracious host, flitted about, ensuring everyone's plates were full and their drinks were refilled, her bright smile and effortless charm putting even the most skeptical of guests at ease. I, on the other hand, stuck out like a sore thumb, my pale skin and dark attire a stark contrast to the sun-kissed faces and colorful attire of the other partygoers. As I watched, a group of children chased each other around the yard, their shrieks of delight carrying on the breeze, and I couldn't help but feel a pang of curiosity about this strange, foreign world that Serena seemed to navigate with such ease. What was it about these gatherings that brought people together, that created this sense of belonging and connection? And why did I, a creature of the night, feel so drawn to it, despite the fact that I would never truly be a part of it?"

The constant hovering is starting to get on my nerves, and I find myself wondering if this is what our relationship has been reduced to - a never-ending cycle of him watching over me and me trying to assert my independence. It's a delicate balance, one that I'm not sure we're navigating very well, and I fear that if we're not careful, it could spell disaster for our already fragile marriage. As I glance over at Alex, I can see the concern etched on his face, and for a moment, I feel a pang of guilt for being so resentful of his efforts. But as I look away, I'm reminded of all the times I've had to fight for my autonomy in this relationship, and I know that I need to keep pushing back against his overprotectiveness if I want to preserve any semblance of my own identity."

I quickly grab her arms to steady her, and she looks up at me with a mixture of sadness and desperation in her eyes. ""What's wrong, Ana?"" I ask, trying to keep my voice calm and soothing, but she just shakes her head and buries her face in my chest, her body shaking with sobs. I hold her tightly, trying to offer what little comfort I can, and wonder what could have happened to upset her so much. We stand there for a moment, the only sound being her muffled crying, and I can feel my mind racing with all the possible reasons why she's so distraught. Is it something to do with her family, or maybe something that happened at school? I gently stroke her hair, trying to calm her down, and wait for her to compose herself enough to tell me what's going on."
"And yet, I carry on. Even after overhearing Alex say, “Please, please, don’t let me die until I","turn twenty-five or I get to visit the the Spy Museum, whatever comes first.” Yeah.

As I reflect on that moment, I am struck by the realization that our time on this earth is short, and the things that truly matter are often the ones we take for granted. The conversation with Alex has left an indelible mark on my heart, and I find myself reevaluating my priorities and seeking to make the most of every moment, to cherish the people and experiences that bring joy and meaning to my life."

"“As it’s not hemoglobin or peanut based, nothing. So.” I clap my hands.

The thought sends a shiver down my spine as I consider the implications of such an action, and I find myself wondering what other motives might be at play. Emery, with her sharp mind and quick wit, seems like an unlikely target, but perhaps that's exactly what makes her so appealing to those who seek to exploit her. I glance around the serene landscape, the cicadas' gentle hum a stark contrast to the turmoil brewing in my mind. As I wait for a response, the air seems to thicken with anticipation, and I can feel the weight of the conversation settling upon me like a physical presence. The trees, once a vibrant green, now seem to loom over us, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching out to snuff out the truth. And then, there's the question of what Emery herself might be hiding, what secrets she might be keeping that could put her in the crosshairs of those who seek to monitor her every move. The more I think about it, the more I realize that nothing is as it seems, and the truth is likely to be far more complex and sinister than I could have ever imagined."

I would find myself wandering around the house, searching for something, anything, that could bring me comfort, but everything seemed empty and hollow without Serena by my side. The silence was deafening, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was living in a nightmare from which I couldn't wake up. As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, the pain didn't subside, but it did become more manageable, and I began to learn how to navigate this new reality, one that was filled with uncertainty and heartache, but also, surprisingly, with a deep sense of resilience and determination."

The sharks in my head grow more aggressive, their gnawing becoming a cacophony of anguish, as I'm forced to confront the terrifying possibility that I may never see Serena again.

"“No.” He stares at the moonlit water. “When we were young, I was there when Koen’s sister met her mate. We were on a run. She smelled her, suddenly went real still",in the middle of the field.

Koen's sister had always been a bit of a wild card, but in that moment, she was completely focused, completely sure of herself and what she was doing. And when they finally stopped running and faced each other, I could feel the tension in the air, the sense that something important was happening. They sniffed each other, circled around, and then they were together, their bodies moving in perfect sync. It was beautiful, really, and a little intimidating - I'd never seen anything like it before. After that, Koen's sister was different, more confident and self-assured, like she'd found a part of herself that she never knew was missing. And now, standing here on the shore, I couldn't help but wonder if I'd ever find that for myself, if I'd ever experience that kind of connection with someone. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I turned back to the water, lost in my own thoughts as the moon continued to shine down on us."
