I [29m] have been friends with Chad [32m] since we were born.

As we grew older, our friendship deepened, and we found ourselves gravitating towards different interests, but our bond remained unbreakable. Chad's outgoing personality often complemented my more reserved nature, and I admired how he could effortlessly make friends wherever we went. In return, he appreciated my loyalty and the fact that I was always there to offer a listening ear. Our friendship has been a constant in my life, a reminder that some relationships can withstand the test of time and distance. Over the years, we've been through our fair share of ups and downs, celebrating each other's successes and supporting each other through life's challenges. Despite our differences, we've managed to maintain a strong and lasting connection, one that I cherish deeply and hope to nurture for many years to come."
"Anyway, forward to five months ago. I dated Hope [28f] for a few weeks. Not a big deal. We decided we weren’t feeling it, no chemistry, so we called it quits. And then lo and behold she hits","it off with Chad. Of course in true Good Luck Charm fashion, this means Chad is her soulmate. Chad is all googly-eyed over her, they’ve met the parents, they’re ring shopping—and they want to move in together. Immediately.","me with a message out of the blue, asking if we could meet up for coffee and catch up on each other's lives. I was a bit taken aback, but I didn't see any harm in it, so I agreed.

I was a bit taken aback, but I didn't see any harm in it, so I agreed. We met at a quaint little café downtown, and it was nice to see her again. She seemed different, though - more relaxed and at ease, and we had a great conversation. As we chatted, I realized that I had misjudged her initially, and that we actually had a lot in common. But just as things were starting to feel like they were going somewhere, she dropped a bombshell: she had started dating someone else, and was only meeting up with me to get my opinion on him. I was taken aback, but tried to play it cool, and we spent the rest of the evening discussing her new relationship. It was a bit surreal, but I was happy to see her happy, and I left the café feeling like I had gained a new friend, rather than a romantic partner. Little did I know, however, that this was only the beginning of a series of unexpected events that would change my life in ways I never could have imagined."
"The only problem is that Chad has six more months on our lease but found a perfect new house for him and Hope, and he can’t afford to pay rent on two places at the same",time. So he had to make the difficult decision to screw me over or screw her over—and he picked me.

We've tried to negotiate with our landlord to see if we can terminate the lease early, but so far, they've been unwilling to budge. Chad is considering subletting the apartment, but that's not an ideal solution for him, as he'd still be responsible for the rent if the subletter fails to pay. Meanwhile, Hope is getting anxious to start their new life together in the perfect house they've found, and the uncertainty surrounding our living situation is causing them a lot of stress. We're all trying to stay positive and hope that a solution will present itself soon, but it's definitely a challenging time for everyone involved. Chad and Hope are exploring all their options, from finding a reliable subletter to potentially taking on a short-term roommate to help split the costs, but nothing is set in stone just yet. As we navigate this tricky situation, we're all keeping our fingers crossed that everything will work out in the end and that Chad and Hope will be able to start their new chapter without too much hassle."
"I’m annoyed, but I decided to try to find a reason to spend more time outside so I don’t have to stare out my window. I’ve always wanted a dog, but Chad would never agree to it. So I went to a rescue and found the ugliest animal there. The one so hideous, nobody else wanted it. This dog’s got an underbite and mange, and he’s missing half an","ear. He’s a little Brussels Griffon, so he’s got that deep frown—he looks like a judgmental gremlin. I adopted him and named him Chad since the dog is now my new best friend.

But I tag him in the captions of every Chad the Dog Instagram post with “Look, a loyal Chad!”","ear, but despite his rough appearance, he had the most beautiful brown eyes that seemed to melt my heart.

""What is that?"" he asked, clearly unimpressed. I just shrugged and said, ""I adopted him from the rescue."" Chad sighed and shook his head, but I could see a hint of a smile on his face. As the days went by, Max became a part of our family, and Chad even started to warm up to him. Max would follow me everywhere, and I loved taking him on long walks around the neighborhood. The fresh air and exercise did wonders for my mood, and I found myself feeling more positive and energized. I started to notice the little things, like the way the sunlight filtered through the trees and the sound of birds singing in the morning. Max became more than just a pet; he was a companion and a reason to get outside and enjoy nature. As I looked into his big brown eyes, I knew that I had made the right decision in adopting him, no matter how ugly he may be. And as for Chad, he eventually grew to love Max just as much as I did, and our little family became complete. We would spend hours playing with Max in the park, laughing and having the best time together. The ugly dog that nobody wanted had brought us closer together, and I was grateful for that. I realized that sometimes, the things that may seem imperfect or unlovable at first can end up being the most beautiful and loving companions we could ever ask for."
I tilted my head so my braid fell to one side and held up four fingers. Maddy,"didn’t look happy, but she took the picture with my phone, then handed it back to me.","raised an eyebrow, clearly amused by my attempt to communicate without speaking, and responded",34,"raised an eyebrow, clearly amused by my attempt to communicate without speaking, and responded by holding up five fingers of her own, a sly grin spreading across her face as she waited for my next move, the air thick with the unspoken challenge that had become a familiar game between us, each trying to outdo the other in a silent battle of wits and creativity, our eyes locked in a sparkling stare that seemed to hold a thousand unspoken words, the world around us melting away as we lost ourselves in the simple yet exhilarating thrill of the moment."
"“That dog trusts him,” Maddy said. “And that’s a rescue dog, so that means something. They’re usually all","skittish and freaked out.” She went quiet again looking at his wall. “Go down further,” Maddy said. “The billboard.”","skittish around people, especially men, due to the trauma they've experienced in the past.

The fact that the dog is so calm and affectionate around him suggests that he has a gentle and compassionate nature, which is a rare quality in someone who has likely been through a lot himself. Maddy's observation sparked a curiosity in her, and she found herself wanting to know more about this mysterious person who had managed to gain the trust of a rescue dog, and perhaps, just perhaps, she could learn to trust him too."
That night after work Maddy made dinner. Grilled portobello mushrooms and rice pilaf. I did,"the dishes and cleaned the kitchen, then took a shower and blew out my hair.","the dishes, trying to make sense of the conversation we had earlier, and Maddy",30,"the dishes, trying to make sense of the conversation we had earlier, and Maddy sat down next to me, putting her hand on my knee in a gentle gesture of comfort, as if she knew I was still reeling from the events of the day, the smell of the mushrooms and the sound of the evening news in the background creating a sense of normalcy that I desperately needed, but couldn't quite grasp, not yet, not until I had a chance to process everything that had happened, and figure out where I was going from here, and what the future held, not just for me, but for us, for our little family, and the life we were trying to build together."
"“Sorry, I had to give Brad his dewormer. I brought some for",you too. Faith said you’ve been dragging your ass on the carpet?”,"you as well, just in case, since you've been spending a lot of time",24,"you as well, just in case, since you've been spending a lot of time with him lately and I don't want to take any chances with your health, especially considering how easily parasites can be transmitted between animals and humans, so I figured it's better to be safe than sorry and have you take the medication too."
My best friend was in a Hawaiian shirt and pink cargo shorts. He was a general manager at Trader Joe’s. I missed not having to go to the grocery store now,"that he had moved out. Actually, I missed a lot of things now that Brad had moved out. Like having another human to talk to, even if it was this one.","because he would always hook me up with the best deals and newest products, allowing me to sample an array of exotic cheeses and craft beers that I never",62,"because he would always hook me up with the best deals and newest products, allowing me to sample an array of exotic cheeses and craft beers that I never would have tried otherwise. His employee discount was also a major perk, and I often found myself taking advantage of it to stock up on my favorite snacks and treats. As we sat on the beach, watching the sunset and sipping on some of the store's famous Two Buck Chuck, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the convenience and camaraderie that his job had brought into my life. We spent the rest of the evening swapping stories and sharing laughs, enjoying each other's company as the stars began to twinkle overhead. It was moments like these that I cherished, and I knew that our friendship was something truly special, one that went far beyond the confines of a grocery store or a Hawaiian shirt."
"“This is true,” Brad said, looking at his phone. “We are",assholes. But only to each other. It’s the foundation of our friendship.”,"currently running a bit behind schedule, and if we don't hurry, we'll miss",23,"currently running a bit behind schedule, and if we don't hurry, we'll miss our reservation at the restaurant, which would be a shame since I've been looking forward to trying their new menu all week, and I know how much you've been craving their signature dish, so let's grab our things and head out the door, we can discuss the rest of the plan on the way, sound good to you?"

They were starting to do the couples thing for all the trips and birthdays. They were all going up,"to Lutsen in October to go hiking. They asked me if I wanted to go, but I didn’t. Not alone.","to the mountains for their annual summer vacation, and it seemed like the perfect opportunity",39,"to the mountains for their annual summer vacation, and it seemed like the perfect opportunity for them to spend some quality time together, away from the hustle and bustle of city life. As they packed their bags and loaded up their cars, the excitement was palpable, and they all couldn't wait to get started on their adventure. The group consisted of five couples, all of whom had been friends since college, and over the years, they had developed a strong bond, often jokingly referring to themselves as a big, happy family. This trip was going to be a celebration of their friendships, as well as a chance to create new memories that would last a lifetime. With the music playing and the GPS set, they hit the road, ready to take on whatever the journey had in store for them, and make the most of their time together in the beautiful mountains."
Brad took a swallow of his drink. “Ask that nurse out. Go,"wherever she is. Pitch the idea to her, she might be into it.”","on, don't be shy, she seems like a great person and you two really",25,"on, don't be shy, she seems like a great person and you two really hit it off, plus it's been a while since you've been on a date, and who knows, maybe this could be the start of something special, you never know unless you try, right, so just go for it and see what happens, the worst that could happen is she says no, but at least you'll know and can move on, and if she says yes, then you've got a fun night ahead of you to look forward to, so what do you say, are you going to take my advice and ask her out or not?"
"“Yeah,” Brad said. “She dates you, you guys break up, and she rides happily into the sunset too. It’s a win-win. Seriously. This is your chance.",If you don’t do something you’re gonna spend the rest of your life sending women on to their forever families and never getting one for you.”,"to take a risk and see where things go with her, and even if it doesn't work out, you'll at least have the experience and the knowledge that you",52,"to take a risk and see where things go with her, and even if it doesn't work out, you'll at least have the experience and the knowledge that you gave it a shot, rather than wondering what could have been if you had only been brave enough to ask her out. Besides, Brad continued, she seems like a great girl, and you two have a lot in common, so it's not like you're taking a huge leap of faith here. You've already established a connection with her, and that's more than a lot of people can say when they start dating someone new. So, what do you say, are you going to go for it, or are you going to let fear hold you back and potentially miss out on something amazing?"
Brad looked me in the eye. “You will never find someone as long as all the women you date aren’t actually meant for you. You’re not their,soulmate. Their soulmate is the person they meet after you. It’s decided the minute it starts. They are literally fated not to be The One.

It's not about finding someone who checks all the boxes on your list, but about finding someone with whom you share a deep emotional connection. Brad's words struck a chord within me, and I realized that I had been focusing on the wrong things in my past relationships. I had been so caught up in the idea of finding someone who fit my ideal that I had neglected to consider whether we truly connected on a deeper level. As I reflected on my past experiences, I began to see a pattern emerge. I had been drawn to people who were charismatic and confident, but ultimately, we had lacked a meaningful connection. I started to understand that I needed to shift my approach and focus on finding someone with whom I could share my thoughts, feelings, and desires. It was a daunting task, but I was determined to take Brad's advice and embark on a journey of self-discovery, hoping to eventually find someone who was truly meant for me."
"I had actually thought about her. I’d checked once or twice to see if she’d messaged me again. She hadn’t. The last message was me telling her it was nice chatting with her, three days ago. Trying to keep talking to her was a dead end if she","lived somewhere else. But I don’t know. Maybe Brad had a point. What could it hurt to try?

It was pointless to keep checking my phone, hoping that she would suddenly appear with a new message, apologizing for the delay or explaining her silence. The reality was, she had lost interest, and I needed to do the same. I decided to focus on other things, like catching up with friends and family, and maybe even trying out that new hobby I had been putting off for months. The distraction would be good for me, and who knows, maybe I'd meet someone new and interesting. As the days went by, I found myself thinking about her less and less, and it was a relief. I realized that I had been investing too much emotional energy into someone I barely knew, and it wasn't healthy. It was time for me to prioritize myself and my own happiness, rather than waiting around for someone who clearly wasn't interested. With a newfound sense of determination, I closed the messaging app and made a promise to myself to move forward, without looking back."

Me: Not sure yet. I live with my best friend Maddy and we alternate who chooses,"where we’ll go next.

"For a moment I debated calling from a blocked number. He was nice, but I still didn’t know him. But I figured it",was just as easy to block him later if he got creepy.

When he finally answered, his voice was warm and friendly, immediately putting me at ease, and we started talking as if no time had passed at all. We chatted about everything and nothing, our conversation flowing effortlessly, and before I knew it, we had been on the phone for over an hour, lost in our own little world. It was then that I realized I had been looking forward to this call all day, and the excitement I felt was not just about resolving the issue that had brought us together, but about reconnecting with him on a personal level."
“But what if it isn’t? I’m just playing devil’s advocate here. What if it isn’t? Brad said that everyone I’m serious enough to date more than twice is cosmically destined for someone else.” He went quiet for,"a beat. “Does nobody feel right to you?

His words hung in the air, leaving an uncomfortable silence that seemed to grow thicker with each passing second. It was as if he had voiced a fear that had been lurking in the shadows, waiting to pounce and disrupt the fragile balance of their conversation. The idea that fate had already predetermined the course of their relationships, that some unseen force was guiding them towards specific people, was both intriguing and terrifying. It raised questions about the nature of free will and the role of destiny in shaping their lives. As they sat there, the silence between them became a palpable thing, a reminder that some secrets were better left unspoken, and some truths were too difficult to confront head-on. The darkness outside seemed to press in around them, making the room feel smaller, more intimate, and the air heavier with unspoken emotions. It was then that he turned back to her, his eyes searching for answers, his voice barely above a whisper as he asked, ""Do you believe in that? Do you think our lives are already mapped out, and we're just following a predetermined path?"" The question hung in the air, waiting for a response, waiting for her to either confirm or deny the existence of a cosmic plan, and the uncertainty that came with it."

But if it does work, we could be looking at a significant advantage, something that could potentially change the course of our lives for the better. The potential benefits are substantial, and I think it's worth exploring, even if it means stepping out of our comfort zones. We'd have to be careful, of course, and make sure we're on the same page, but I genuinely believe this could be an opportunity we shouldn't pass up. It's not every day that something like this comes along, and I think we owe it to ourselves to at least give it a shot. So, what do you say? Are you in, or are you out?"

“Not today. But when I had lunch with them yesterday we talked about the Reddit thread.

One of them even joked that we should start our own subreddit to discuss the topic further, which led to a lively debate about the pros and cons of social media and its impact on our lives. As we delved deeper into the conversation, it became clear that their initial skepticism had given way to a genuine interest in understanding the online community and its dynamics, and I found myself appreciating their willingness to learn and adapt to new ideas. The discussion also made me realize that, despite our differences in age and background, we could still find common ground and engage in meaningful conversations, and I left the lunch feeling grateful for the opportunity to connect with them on a deeper level."

I pulled up to the high school pickup line and put the car,"in park, then grabbed my phone to look at the picture of Emma. Again.","in park, waiting for my daughter to emerge from the crowded hallway, her",27,"in park, waiting for my daughter to emerge from the crowded hallway, her bright pink backpack a beacon amidst the sea of students flooding out of the building, all of them eager to start their weekend, and as I sat there, I couldn't help but think about how fast she was growing up, and how these daily routines, like picking her up from school, were slowly becoming a thing of the past, a bittersweet reminder of the passage of time."
"A bell rang and kids started pouring out. The last day of summer school. When I saw my brother, Alex, walking with a","group of his friends toward the buses, I rolled down the passenger side window and leaned across the seat. “Hey! Need a ride?”","group of friends, I couldn't help but notice the huge smile on his face, a stark contrast to the gloomy expression he had worn",46,"group of friends, I couldn't help but notice the huge smile on his face, a stark contrast to the gloomy expression he had worn all summer. As he approached me, I asked him what was wrong, but he just shook his head and said it was nothing, that he was just excited for the freedom that came with the end of summer school. I raised an eyebrow, skeptical of his response, but before I could press him further, our mom called out to us from across the parking lot, reminding us that we had to get going if we wanted to beat the traffic. As we walked towards her, Alex's friends bid him farewell, and I couldn't help but feel a pang of curiosity about what had really been going on with him all summer. The car ride home was filled with the usual chatter about our plans for the upcoming school year, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off, that there was more to Alex's story than he was letting on. Little did I know, the end of summer school was only the beginning of a series of events that would change our lives forever."

"I came in and looked around. “This is new,” I said. She had red LED string lights along",the walls. The whole bedroom was bathed in red.

It was clear that she had put a lot of thought into creating this space, and I found myself feeling drawn to it, wanting to sit down and stay for a while. The air was filled with the scent of old books and freshly brewed coffee, which only added to the sense of comfort and relaxation that permeated the room. As I looked around, I saw that she had also added a few plants, which added a touch of green to the space and helped to purify the air. Overall, the room felt like a peaceful oasis, a place where one could escape the stresses of everyday life and simply be."
Maddy looked up. Then her eyes dropped to the laptop I was holding and she somehow immediately,"knew what was about to happen. “No.” She shook her head. “No. No, no, no, no, no.

"As we started pulling our bags from the trunk, a brown-haired middle-aged woman came out of",the side of the three-car garage. “Are you Emma?” she said in a thick Mexican accent.,"the house, wearing a warm smile and a faded apron, her eyes sparkling with a mix of curiosity",32,"the house, wearing a warm smile and a faded apron, her eyes sparkling with a mix of curiosity and hospitality as she approached us, extending a hand in greeting, and I couldn't help but notice the way the afternoon sunlight danced through her hair, highlighting the subtle wisps of gray that framed her face, giving her an air of gentle wisdom and kindness that immediately put me at ease, and as she introduced herself as our host, Mrs. Jenkins, I felt a sense of relief wash over me, knowing that we were in good hands during our stay in this quaint little town."

Maddy must have been thinking the same thing I was. “Does it rain a,"lot in Minnesota?” she asked, raising her voice over the sound of the old motor.","lot here?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper, as if the sound of the raindrops",29,"lot here?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper, as if the sound of the raindrops on the roof was the only noise that mattered, and we both stood there, lost in the rhythmic beat, our minds wandering to the memories of rainy days spent indoors, watching the droplets slide down the windowpane, creating a mesmerizing display of nature's symphony, and for a moment, everything else seemed to fade away, leaving only the two of us, suspended in the serenity of the rainy afternoon."
We lugged our bags up the stairs and were sweating by the time we made it to the door. We came in through a screened-in porch that overlooked the lake. Maddy and,I shared a glance. It was adorable.

The interior was just as charming, with vintage fishing nets and faded photographs adorning the walls, telling stories of summers past. As we dropped our bags onto the floor, Maddy's eyes sparkled with excitement, and she began to give us a tour of the cabin, pointing out her favorite spots, including the old wooden dock where she had spent hours swimming and fishing as a child. The air was thick with the scent of pine and the sound of birdsong filled the air, immediately making us feel at ease. We spent the rest of the afternoon unpacking and settling in, and as the sun began to set, we gathered on the porch, watching the stars twinkle to life above, feeling grateful for this little slice of paradise and the adventures that lay ahead."
"The bedrooms were off the living room on either side of a short hallway with a single bathroom shared in the middle.

Despite the differences, both rooms shared a sense of calmness, with soft carpets underfoot and gentle color schemes that promoted relaxation. The overall atmosphere of the living space was one of understated elegance, suggesting that the residents preferred a quiet, unassuming lifestyle, free from the distractions and chaos of the outside world."
"Four hours later, Maddy and I were back at the cottage sitting in the screened-in porch.",We’d had dinner in town and then boated back. The fridge was stocked up and we’d unpacked.,The warm summer air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the sound of crickets,33,"The warm summer air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the sound of crickets provided a soothing background hum, a stark contrast to the tension that had been building up inside us since our earlier encounter, and as we sat there, I couldn't help but notice the look of deep contemplation on Maddy's face, her eyes fixed on some distant point beyond the porch railing, lost in thought, and I wondered what was going through her mind, whether she was replaying the events of the day or worrying about what the future held for us, and I felt a surge of affection for her, wanting to reach out and comfort her, but unsure of how to bridge the silence that had fallen between us."
She looked away from me. “Emma…” Her eyes came back to mine. “Please. Please do it.,Do it now before you lose the chance to meet them altogether. People don’t live forever.”,"don't make me beg, I'm already on my knees, my heart is racing, and every fiber of my being",32,"don't make me beg, I'm already on my knees, my heart is racing, and every fiber of my being is screaming for you to just give in, to let go of whatever it is that's holding you back, to take a chance, to roll the dice, to see where this journey takes us, because the thought of living without you, of never experiencing the depths of our connection, is a prospect too daunting to bear, and so I implore you, Emma, please, for the sake of our love, for the sake of our sanity, just say yes, say you'll do it, say you'll take the leap of faith with me."
"“How about this,” Maddy said. “Run your DNA and make your account private. We’ll change your privacy settings for a few minutes, poke around.

Just remember, once we make your account private again, it might take some time for the changes to take effect, so we should be prepared for anything. Are you ready to give it a try, or do you want to think about it for a bit longer? Maddy's eyes were filled with excitement and a hint of caution, knowing that uncovering secrets about one's family can be a double-edged sword, bringing both joy and unexpected challenges."
We prioritized power for the coffee maker first and we brewed a pot while I sat in the kitchen with,"a towel wrapped around my head.

The snail’s-pace speed the pontoon put out somehow seemed faster with the beach approaching. Maddy threw it in reverse. The engine,"downshifted miserably, but we started to slow. Then to my horror we began to move backward, motor first, right into the dock.","roared to life, spewing forth a cloud of noxious fumes as the pontoon lurched backward, its movements awkward and uncoordinated,",43,"roared to life, spewing forth a cloud of noxious fumes as the pontoon lurched backward, its movements awkward and uncoordinated, like a clumsy dancer trying to regain its footing on the water. Maddy's eyes darted back and forth between the shore and the instrument panel, her mind racing with the calculations of distance and speed, as she struggled to maneuver the unwieldy craft into a position that would allow them to disembark safely. The beach was getting closer and closer, the sound of the waves gently lapping against the shore growing louder, a soothing melody that belied the tension building inside Maddy's chest. She knew that one wrong move could spell disaster, and the weight of that responsibility settled heavily on her shoulders, making her grip on the controls tighten with a mix of fear and determination."
"When we were safely away from anything we could crash into, Maddy killed the engine and slumped in the captain’s","seat. “If we’d been on the other side of the dock, we could have hit the yacht,” she said, looking shaken.","chair, letting out a deep breath as she gazed out at the endless expanse of water stretching before us.

The silence was a welcome respite from the chaos that had erupted just moments before, and I took a moment to collect my thoughts, trying to process the events that had led us to this point. As I looked over at Maddy, I could see the tension still etched on her face, her eyes narrowed slightly as she scanned the horizon. I knew that she was still on high alert, waiting for any sign of danger, and I couldn't blame her. We had been through a lot together, and I had come to trust her instincts implicitly. But as the minutes ticked by, the silence between us began to feel more comfortable, and I found myself relaxing in the warm sunlight, feeling the gentle rock of the boat as it swayed on the waves. It was a peaceful moment, one that I savored, knowing that it might be a long time before we had another chance to catch our breath."
"I lined the nose of the boat up with the side of the dock and started for it again, only this time I killed the thrust earlier.

The dock's rusty cleats and faded ropes seemed to stretch out like skeletal fingers, waiting to secure us in place. With a final burst of precision, I brought the boat to a stop, the nose nudging gently against the dock's worn bumper. The silence that followed was almost palpable, broken only by the creaking of the old wooden dock and the distant call of a seagull wheeling overhead. I let out a sigh of relief as I killed the engine, feeling a sense of accomplishment at having successfully navigated the tricky approach. Now, all that remained was to secure the boat and start unloading the gear, a task that promised to be just as challenging as getting to the dock in the first place."

I was trying to take a shortcut and I think I ended up on the wrong path."" She could hear the faint sound of leaves crunching and twigs snapping in the background, and her mind immediately went to all the worst-case scenarios.

When the call ended, she stood still for a moment, the phone still clutched in her hand, her mind racing with the implications of what she had just heard.

Maddy was already off the pontoon and running toward me across the beach.

“Are you kidding me with this?” Maddy hissed as soon as they were out,of earshot. “She’s here for what? Six hours?

Maddy rolled her eyes in the way that I knew meant she was aware. “Please tell me I don’t have to stay and watch,you eat crustaceans with that woman. Let’s just go back to the island and you see her tomorrow or something when she’s done with what’s-his-face.”,"the rest of this train wreck unfold, because honestly, I don't think my sanity can take much more of this drama,"" she said, her voice laced with a",49,"the rest of this train wreck unfold, because honestly, I don't think my sanity can take much more of this drama,"" she said, her voice laced with a mix of amusement and exasperation, as she grabbed my arm and started pulling me towards the door, clearly ready to make a quick escape from the impending disaster that was about to ensue, and I couldn't help but laugh at her dramatics, even as I felt a pang of relief at the prospect of leaving the chaos behind, at least for a little while, and maybe, just maybe, we could grab some coffee and catch up on some much-needed gossip, away from the prying eyes and ears of our nosy friends, who seemed to take great pleasure in our misfortunes, and I had to admit, the thought of spilling all the juicy details to Maddy, who would undoubtedly offer her signature blend of sarcasm and sage advice, was just the thing to take my mind off the mess that my life had become, and so, with a sense of gratitude, I let her lead me out of the room, and into the bright, uncertain future, where anything could happen, and probably would, given our track record."
I watched him walk to the beach and I let out a long breath. Maddy was right.,"This was bad. Mom never left anywhere on good terms. Not jobs, or apartments, or relationships. Especially relationships.",The tension that had been building up inside me for the past few hours finally started to dissipate as I realized that I had,35,"The tension that had been building up inside me for the past few hours finally started to dissipate as I realized that I had been overreacting to the situation, and that sometimes it's necessary to take a step back and let things unfold on their own, just as Maddy had suggested, her words of wisdom echoing in my mind as I stood there, feeling the warm sun on my skin and the gentle breeze rustling my hair, a sense of calm washing over me as I gazed out at the vast expanse of the ocean, its waves crashing against the shore in a soothing melody that seemed to lull my worries to sleep."
I felt relieved the instant he said he would stay with me because it let Maddy off the hook. She would walk through hell for,me—and this cookout was her hell. I was glad she didn’t have to be here. Sometimes her reaction to Mom was more stressful than Mom herself.,"anyone she cared about, but I knew she had been looking forward to a night out with her friends all week and I didn't want her to have to cancel",51,"anyone she cared about, but I knew she had been looking forward to a night out with her friends all week and I didn't want her to have to cancel her plans because of me. With Jack staying, I could finally relax and not worry about being alone, and at the same time, I felt a little guilty for being so dependent on others for my sense of security. As we sat down to watch a movie, I couldn't help but think about how my life had changed over the past few months and how I had become so reliant on the people around me to get through the tough times. Jack's presence was a comforting reminder that I wasn't alone, and I was grateful for his willingness to put my needs before his own, even if it meant sacrificing his own plans for the evening. As the night wore on, we chatted and laughed, and for the first time in a long time, I felt like myself again, like the weight of the world wasn't crushing me. And as I glanced over at Jack, I realized that sometimes, all it takes is one person to make a difference, to be that rock that holds you together when everything else seems to be falling apart."

"Now I blew out a long breath. “Well, she’s funny. Hardworking. She reads any book she can get her hands on and she remembers everything she reads, even years later. She had me really","young.

As we spent more time together, I discovered that she had a passion for learning and a curiosity about the world that was infectious, and I found myself looking forward to our conversations more and more. Her love for reading had given her a unique perspective on life, and she was able to draw parallels between the stories she had read and the events that were unfolding around us, making her insights both fascinating and thought-provoking. I was struck by her intelligence and her creativity, and I began to realize that there was so much more to her than I had initially thought, and I was eager to get to know her better and explore the depths of her mind and heart."
"When I got back to the cottage an hour later, Maddy was in the screened-in porch, reading. She","wore shorts and flip-flops, and she was drinking a beer. She set down her book when I came in.","looked up from her book as I approached, a hint of a smile on her face, and I could tell she was",37,"looked up from her book as I approached, a hint of a smile on her face, and I could tell she was eager to hear about my walk in the woods, her eyes sparkling with curiosity as she marked her place in the novel with a finger, her hair tied back in a loose ponytail, with a few stray strands framing her face, and the warm sunlight filtering through the screens cast a gentle glow over the entire scene, making it feel like a peaceful summer afternoon, untouched by the worries and cares of the world beyond our little clearing."

He grinned back and forth between us. “Maybe we can get together for dinner later this,"week, once you’ve gotten settled in,” he said. “Amber and I would love to have you.”","week and catch up on everything that's been happening, I've got a lot to fill you in",32,"week and catch up on everything that's been happening, I've got a lot to fill you in on and I'm sure you do too, plus I've been wanting to try out that new restaurant that just opened up downtown, have you heard anything about it, is the food any good, and by the way, how was your week, anything exciting happen, I feel like I haven't seen you in ages and I'm really looking forward to spending some quality time together and just relaxing, no pressure, just a nice evening out."
It was never going to happen. I knew this. But Maddy wouldn’t let it go unless,"I tried—and really, I should try.

"I paused, not sure how much I wanted to share. I decided on all of it. Emma was going to","be here when it all hit the fan anyway, so there was no point in keeping her in the dark.","be my confidante, my partner in unraveling the mysteries that had been shrouded in secrecy",40,"be my confidante, my partner in unraveling the mysteries that had been shrouded in secrecy for so long, and I knew that I could trust her with the deepest, darkest secrets that I had been carrying around for what felt like an eternity, secrets that had the power to both liberate and destroy me, depending on how they were received, and so I took a deep breath, steeling myself for the potential fallout, and began to recount the events that had led me to this moment, to this precipice of uncertainty and transformation, where the only constant was the unshakeable feeling that nothing would ever be the same again."

Her story, I imagined, was one of courage and perseverance, a powerful reminder that we are all capable of growth and change, no matter what challenges we may encounter. And yet, despite the sense of peace and tranquility that surrounded her, I sensed a deep sadness in her eyes, a hint of the pain and suffering that still lingered beneath the surface. It was a poignant reminder that healing is a lifelong process, one that requires patience, self-awareness, and a willingness to confront the demons of our past. As I sat there, I felt a sense of awe and admiration for this woman, who had faced her struggles head-on and emerged stronger and wiser as a result. Her presence was a gift, a reminder to appreciate the beauty and complexity of the human experience, and to approach each person we meet with kindness, empathy, and understanding."

I was looking forward to the do-over.","party, when we were standing by the fireplace and she was laughing at",26,"party, when we were standing by the fireplace and she was laughing at something I said, her eyes sparkling with a warmth that made my heart skip a beat, and for a moment, I thought I saw a flicker of invitation in her gaze, a hint that she might not have minded if I had leaned in closer, my lips brushing against hers in a gentle, exploratory kiss, but the moment passed, and we both looked away, the tension between us dissipating into the noise and chaos of the surrounding crowd, leaving me to wonder if I had just imagined the whole thing, if it was just my own desire playing tricks on me, but now, as I think about it, I realize that I've been wanting to kiss her for a long time, and maybe, just maybe, tonight will be the night I finally work up the courage to do it."
I’d tried to be softer with her the last few days. The energy shift I’d had over Mom after my talk with Emma,"was almost as bad as being mad at her.

I took a deep breath and reminded myself of all the times we had been close, of the laughter and the adventures we had shared, and I let those memories guide my interactions with her. As the days turned into weeks, I started to notice a subtle but significant shift in her demeanor as well, a softening of her edges and a willingness to listen that I hadn't seen in a long time. It was a fragile and tentative thing, this newfound understanding between us, but I was determined to nurture it and help it grow, no matter what challenges lay ahead."
"This was another thing I was trying not to think about—her leaving. I should be happy that she came at all, that she wasn’t in Hawaii. We still had three more dates, maybe more if I could convince her. I’d already gotten a freebie the other night at","Mom’s. But I dreaded the clock running out.

As I pondered these thoughts, I couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude for the time we had shared so far, and I made a mental note to cherish every moment we had left. The days that followed were a whirlwind of activity, as we tried to pack in as much as possible, from long walks in the park to cozy nights in, watching movies and talking about our dreams and aspirations. Despite the looming deadline of her departure, we both tried to stay present, focusing on the here and now, and making the most of the time we had together. As the hours ticked by, I found myself feeling more and more attached to her, and I knew that saying goodbye was going to be one of the hardest things I'd ever had to do."

It was reassuring to see that they were taking my problem seriously, and I found myself feeling a sense of gratitude towards them. With a nod, they agreed to help me, and together we began to brainstorm a plan to tackle the issue at hand."
Emma pulled two Ziploc bags from her purse. They had Wheat Thins and celery in them. Probably her,"work snacks. “I trust this zipper seal with my life,” she said, turning to hand them to our passengers.","snack for the road, a habit she had developed over the years to avoid relying on fast food or gas station",37,"snack for the road, a habit she had developed over the years to avoid relying on fast food or gas station junk when she was driving alone, and as she handed one to Ryan, he raised an eyebrow in amusement, familiar with her quirks and the way she always seemed to be prepared for any situation, no matter how small or insignificant it might seem to others, and he smiled, taking a Wheat Thin and crunching into it with a contented sigh, the simple pleasure of the crunchy snack a comforting accompaniment to the long drive ahead of them."
"I think I would have been embarrassed if I’d been on a date with anyone else. My mother, sobbing drunk the night before",she left for prison. But I knew Emma didn’t judge.

As we sat on the couch the next morning, sipping coffee and surveying the aftermath of the previous night's festivities, I realized that I was actually glad that he had been there to witness my mother's antics, if only because it had given us a shared experience to laugh about and bond over. And as we chatted and joked, I found myself feeling more and more at ease in his presence, like I could be my true self around him without fear of judgment or rejection. It was a strange and wonderful feeling, and one that I couldn't help but want to explore further."

It was funny that two pivotal moments in my life were happening at the exact same time and at complete odds with each,other.

On the other hand, I was dealing with a personal crisis that threatened to upend my entire world, leaving me feeling lost and uncertain about the future. The juxtaposition of these two events was not lost on me, and I couldn't help but wonder if the universe was trying to tell me something, or if this was simply a cruel coincidence.

But life had a way of happening, and here I was, standing at the edge of something new and uncertain, with no clear idea of what the future held. As I pondered the risks and uncertainties, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was standing at a crossroads, with the potential for great joy or great heartache stretching out before me like an uncharted road. And yet, despite the doubts and fears that swirled inside me, I felt a spark of hope, a sense that maybe, just maybe, I was ready to take a chance and see where this journey might lead."

He nodded over his shoulder. “I should probably let you get back to work.

I took her hand and did my best to make my face straight. People were already stopping to watch.

We walked in silence, the only sound being the murmur of the onlookers and the rustling of leaves beneath our feet. As we turned the corner, I caught sight of a familiar figure waiting for us, a look of concern etched on their face. I quickened my pace, eager to reach them and find some sense of solace in their presence. But as we drew closer, I realized that their concern was not just for us, but for something else entirely, something that made my blood run cold."
"“She’ll be home one day, Sarah. It’ll come faster than you think. You can visit her and write to her and call her.","You can stay close to her—you just have to try.
