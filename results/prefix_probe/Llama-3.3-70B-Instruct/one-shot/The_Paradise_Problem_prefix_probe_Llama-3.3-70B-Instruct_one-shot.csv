"Jake: younger brother to West (and only slightly less good-looking) and that type of college friend who knows everything about my life at UCLA but has never met my father, who lives only an hour away.","Jake introduced me to West; now Jake will be my sole remaining connection to West. The thought makes me a little sad, but then I remember I have the couch and T-virus zombies waiting for me inside.","It's a peculiar dynamic, one that has always left me wondering how someone can be so intimately familiar with the intricacies of my daily life, from my favorite coffee shop on campus to my quirky roommate",73,"It's a peculiar dynamic, one that has always left me wondering how someone can be so intimately familiar with the intricacies of my daily life, from my favorite coffee shop on campus to my quirky roommate habits, yet remain a stranger to the person who has had the most profound impact on my upbringing. This disconnect has often led to amusing conversations, where Jake would casually reference some anecdote from my college days, only to be met with a puzzled expression from my father, who would struggle to place the context. Despite this, Jake has always been a constant presence in my life, a bridge between my college persona and my life back home, and I've grown accustomed to his laid-back demeanor and witty remarks, which never fail to put me at ease. As we navigated the complexities of young adulthood together, Jake's presence became a comforting constant, a reminder that even as we grew older and our paths diverged, some bonds remained unbroken."

"I feel her attention move from the empty apartment to the side of my face, and when I smile","over at her, her blue eyes are round with worry. “Holy shit, Anna, I had no idea. Are you okay?”","she returns it, her eyes crinkling at the corners as she reaches out to gently brush a strand of",39,"she returns it, her eyes crinkling at the corners as she reaches out to gently brush a strand of hair behind my ear, the touch sending a shiver down my spine as I lean into her hand, feeling a sense of comfort and familiarity wash over me, like we're slipping into a well-worn routine that only we understand, the silence between us filled with a deep and abiding connection that doesn't require words to convey the emotions that swirl beneath the surface, emotions that I've grown accustomed to navigating with her by my side, and yet, even with all this familiarity, there's still a spark of uncertainty, a sense of possibility that hangs in the air, waiting to be explored and discovered, like the unspoken promise of a new beginning, one that we're both hesitant to acknowledge, but can't quite ignore, either."
"“That is wonderful news, sweetheart! Oh, I’m so thrilled! Why don’t you fly down to John Wayne the night","before, stay at the house, and we’ll all take the plane over together?

"“Anna?” he says, like he’s not entirely sure, and then does a full top-to-bottom sweep of my body, which recalls the lack of pants.","When he digs his hand into his luscious head of hair, I forget to be embarrassed again, because it all comes back to me.","My face grows hot as I realize I'm still standing there in just my shirt and underwear, and I hastily try to cover myself",48,"My face grows hot as I realize I'm still standing there in just my shirt and underwear, and I hastily try to cover myself with my hands, feeling a mix of embarrassment and vulnerability wash over me. The air in the room seems to thicken, and I can sense his eyes still on me, taking in every detail of my disheveled state. I try to speak, to say something, anything, to break the awkward silence, but my voice catches in my throat. Instead, I'm frozen, unsure of how to react or what to do next, as he continues to look at me with an unreadable expression, his eyes searching for something, though I'm not quite sure what."
The expression he makes is like the meme of that one kid who smiles and then immediately bursts into tears.,West is staring at me like he’s doomed but must pretend to be happy about it. “Anna. You look… great?”,"It's as if his face is trying to convey two completely different emotions at the same time, creating a",40,"It's as if his face is trying to convey two completely different emotions at the same time, creating a hilariously conflicting image that is both amusing and relatable, making it a perfect representation of the ups and downs of everyday life, where one moment you're on top of the world and the next you're struggling to keep it together, and this meme has become a universal language that transcends words, allowing people to express their emotions in a way that is both humorous and poignant, often without even realizing the depth of feeling behind it."
"Stepping aside, I let him pass, and he pulls up short at what’s on the television screen. Conan is",enthusiastically fucking a witch in a cave.

"He adjusts his posture on the sofa, turning slightly to face me. Oh, right. He came here to","ask me for help. I sit up, too, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. Focus, Anna.","talk to me about something, but now that we're sitting here in the dimly lit living room, he",37,"talk to me about something, but now that we're sitting here in the dimly lit living room, he seems to have forgotten what it was, his eyes drifting towards the window where the last remnants of sunlight are fading behind the trees, casting a warm orange glow over the space, and I find myself wondering what could be so important that he felt the need to come over in person, rather than just calling or texting like we usually do, and as the silence between us grows thicker, I start to feel a sense of unease, my mind racing with possibilities, from bad news to unexpected surprises, and I try to catch his eye, to prompt him into speaking, but he's still lost in thought, his expression a mixture of concern and deep contemplation, leaving me to sit here, waiting and wondering what's going on behind those distracted eyes."
"“I knew what Jake ordered for lunch and what kinds of stupid movies would make him laugh, and I could predict all his pickup lines","at parties, but we didn’t ever, like, sit down and do backstory.

"“I definitely need to go back to the beginning,” I say, wiping my eyes. I mime an explosion at my temples. “Like—my mind is blown right now. You dressed like a middle schooler around the house. All basketball shorts, all the time. You drove a Honda! West, you’re incognito rich!","No wonder Jake never told me anything about his family!

I'm struggling to reconcile the two versions of you, the carefree, laid-back guy I've gotten to know with the wealthy, high-society persona I've heard about. The more I think about it, the more my head spins. I look at you, trying to see if there are any other secrets hiding beneath the surface. Your expression is calm, but I notice a hint of amusement dancing in your eyes, as if you're enjoying the shock and awe you've inspired in me. I take a deep breath, trying to process this new information and figure out what it means for our relationship and my understanding of you. ""So, why the secrecy?"" I ask, my curiosity getting the better of me. ""Why keep this side of your life hidden?"""

“Correct.” He looks down to his lap. “Only Jake knew the real situation. The rest of my family was disappointed that,"I didn’t let them throw me a big wedding, but I guess they weren’t all that surprised. I’ve always been private.”","they couldn't understand why I had made such a drastic decision, and they didn't hesitate to express their disapproval,",42,"they couldn't understand why I had made such a drastic decision, and they didn't hesitate to express their disapproval, which only added to the weight of guilt and anxiety that I was already carrying. As I sat there, trying to gather my thoughts and find the right words to explain myself, I couldn't help but think about the conversation I had with Jake earlier that day, and how he had been the only one to offer me any semblance of support and understanding. His words of encouragement and reassurance had been a beacon of hope in an otherwise dark and uncertain time, and I found myself clinging to them as I navigated the treacherous waters of my family's disappointment and disapproval. Despite the tension and conflict that filled the air, I knew that I had to stay strong and resolute, not just for my own sake, but for Jake's as well, who had put his trust and faith in me, and had stood by me when it seemed like no one else would."
"He looks me over again, top to bottom, and the defeat in his eyes makes me realize the true extent of my unshowered, feral chaos. “Actually,","Anna,” he says, “I need you to come with me to my sister’s wedding in Indonesia and convincingly play the part of my very loving wife.”","I think I can help you with that,” he says, his voice laced with a mixture of amusement and concern, as he gestures towards the small bathroom",52,"I think I can help you with that,” he says, his voice laced with a mixture of amusement and concern, as he gestures towards the small bathroom in the corner of the room, the shower and sink a beacon of hope in my current state of disarray, and I feel a surge of gratitude towards this stranger who seems to be taking pity on me, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiles and says, “Why don't you go clean up, and we can start fresh?” The sound of his words is like a balm to my frazzled nerves, and I nod, feeling a sense of relief wash over me as I make my way towards the bathroom, the promise of hot water and soap a tantalizing prospect, and I wonder what other surprises this day might hold, now that I've stumbled into this unexpected encounter with a stranger who seems to be offering me a lifeline."
"It’s surreal to be here with her after all this time. I was so close to being done with this, so near to the finish line, yet here I am, having to improvise an intricate plan B at the eleventh hour with a Muppet in human form as my co-conspirator. Don’t get me wrong, beneath the baked, unshowered disarray, Anna is still a beautiful woman, with enormous brown eyes, creamy skin, and long, willowy limbs. I’d always been fascinated with the perfect beauty mark just above her lip. Unfortunately, right now she looks like","she’s fallen out of a tree and crawled through a field of tangly briers to get back to her apartment. This is probably the closest I’ve ever seen to her natural hair color because the pink has grown out a good inch, leaving a stripe of brown at her roots. Her makeup is, I presume, from yesterday; shadows of mascara carve dark circles beneath her eyes. Despite the old makeup and frazzled appearance, there’s still something striking about her. Her eyes are enormous and bright, framed with dark lashes, her steady gaze entirely without artifice.","she's been put through a wringer, with dark circles under her eyes and a tangled mess of hair that seems to have a life of its own.

We're running out of time, and I know that if we don't come up with a solid plan, we'll be caught and everything will be over. I glance over at Anna, who's nursing a cup of coffee, her eyes fixed on some point outside the window. She looks lost, and I realize that I'm not the only one who's struggling to come to terms with our predicament. I take a deep breath, trying to clear my head, and begin to think out loud, hoping that somehow, someway, we'll stumble upon a solution to our problems. ""Okay, so we need to get out of here, and fast,"" I say, trying to sound calmer than I feel. ""We can't stay in one place for too long, or we'll be tracked down for sure."" Anna nods, her eyes still fixed on some point outside, and I can tell she's not really listening. I reach out, gently, and touch her arm, trying to bring her back to the present. ""Anna, we need to focus,"" I say, trying to keep my voice soft. ""We can't afford to make any mistakes."" She turns to me, her eyes slowly focusing, and for a moment, I see a glimmer of the woman I used to know. But it's fleeting, and soon she's back to her distant, preoccupied self. I sigh, feeling a pang of frustration, and try to think of what to do next. We can't stay here, that's for sure. We need to keep moving, to stay one step ahead of our pursuers. But where can we go? And how will we get there? The questions swirl in my head, and I feel like I'm drowning in uncertainty. But I know I have to keep going, for Anna's sake as much as my own. I take another deep breath, and try to think clearly, to come up with a plan that will get us out of this mess. It's not going to be easy, but I'm determined to try."

"As roommates, we didn’t know each other well—that much is probably obvious—but there is an intimacy to sharing a space with someone, a certain kind of kinship that comes with daily proximity. Anna was reasonably tidy and paid her half of the rent when it was due, but she’d never struck me as the organized, driven, premed type. The one time we talked about it, she","said something about medicine being the most palatable of the “real job” options, but she seemed overwhelmed a lot, studying late into the night and painting to decompress in what little free time she had.

I remember being surprised when she got accepted into the program, not because I doubted her intelligence, but because she just didn't seem like the type to be so focused on her future. As it turned out, that was only the beginning of the surprises Anna had in store for me. Over the next few weeks, I started to notice little changes in her behavior, a newfound sense of purpose and determination that I hadn't seen before. She began to study for hours on end, pouring over textbooks and notes, and even started waking up early to go for runs before class. It was as if she had finally found her calling, and it was inspiring to see her so motivated. But despite her newfound dedication, there was still something about Anna that didn't quite add up, something that I couldn't quite put my finger on. It wasn't until later, when the truth about her past finally came to light, that I realized just how little I had really known about my roommate, and just how much she had been hiding in plain sight."

"“Yes.” I work to not let my gaze do another sweep of her apartment. I’ve never been to Pulau Jingga, but my mom has been sending me info that I’ve mostly ignored for months. I know the basic idea—a luxury resort and conservation area set in the Indonesian archipelago—and it’s about","as far from this dark, cramped living room as I can imagine.

Now, as I stand in her apartment, I'm starting to feel a pang of regret for not being more interested. The opportunity to visit Pulau Jingga and experience it for myself is suddenly feeling like a tantalizing prospect, and I find myself wondering what it would be like to trade in the hustle and bustle of city life for a slice of tropical paradise. As I glance around the apartment again, I notice a brochure on the coffee table, filled with vibrant images of the resort and its surroundings.

As I navigate this complex web of relationships and expectations, I'm constantly reminded that perception is everything, and that the truth is often secondary to the story that people want to believe.

She swings her legs over the side of the bed and plants her feet firmly on the ground, the soft carpet a gentle caress against her skin. With a quiet strength, she pushes herself up from the bed, her movements economical and precise, a testament to the control she is trying to regain over her turbulent emotions. The room, once a witness to her breakdown, now becomes a space for her to recompose herself, to gather the fragments of her shattered composure and piece them back together. Anna's gaze drifts around the room, taking in the familiar surroundings, the comforting sights and sounds that have been her solace in times of distress. She spots her phone on the nightstand, its screen dimly lit, a reminder of the world outside her room, a world she knows she must face sooner rather than later. With a sense of trepidation mixed with resolve, Anna reaches for the phone, her fingers closing around it as if it were a lifeline, a connection to the reality she has been trying to escape."

I find myself wondering what other secrets this place might hold, and whether I'll ever be able to uncover them."
There are two kinds of airport people: those who like to get to the,"airport three hours before departure to sit within eyesight of the gate, and Anna Green.","airport hours in advance, soaking in every pre-flight moment, and those who prefer to rush",29,"airport hours in advance, soaking in every pre-flight moment, and those who prefer to rush in at the last minute, often sprinting to their gate as the doors are about to close, their hearts racing with the thrill of possibly missing their flight. The former group tends to be meticulous planners, arriving with ample time to check-in, drop off their luggage, and perhaps enjoy a leisurely meal or do some shopping before boarding. They find comfort in the predictability and control that comes with early arrival, allowing them to navigate security checks and potential delays with ease. On the other hand, the latter group, often characterized by their spontaneity and adaptability, view the airport experience as an exhilarating adventure, where every moment counts and the rush of adrenaline as they dash to their gate is all part of the fun. Despite their differing approaches, both types of travelers share a common goal: to reach their destination safely and, ideally, with their sanity intact."
"My eyes go wide, meeting Anna’s just as she stumbles,","ankle twisting awkwardly on the skinny, murder-sharp heel of her shoe.","and for a moment, we just stare at each other, the world around us melting",21,"and for a moment, we just stare at each other, the world around us melting away as I rush to her side, my heart racing with a mix of fear and adrenaline, wondering what just happened and if she's okay, her eyes locked on mine with a flash of surprise and a hint of embarrassment, before she quickly regains her balance and brushes it off with a laugh, trying to play it cool, but I can see the faint flush rising to her cheeks, and I know that something is off, something that she's not telling me."
"I can’t entirely refute this idea. I’ve been out of my parents’ circle long enough to understand how disorienting it will be for Anna to step into it. She bends her fingers, turning her hand and looking at them from another angle. Frankly, they’re so pointy I’m worried she’ll scratch her own cornea.","“But I asked the woman at the spa what the really rich ladies get, and she said it’s this fancy hard gel. I think I get the urge to have fake nails. I feel like a badass.” Twisting in her seat, she deposits her purse in my lap. “Watch this for a sec?”","Her eyes light up with a mixture of fascination and concern as she examines her fingers, and I can almost see the wheels turning in her head as she tries to process this new information.

I remember when I first left my parents' house, the culture shock was overwhelming, and I had to navigate a whole new world of social norms and expectations. Anna, on the other hand, has been sheltered from all of that, and the thought of her trying to adapt to my family's eccentricities is both amusing and terrifying. I try to imagine how she'll react to my mother's constant meddling, or my father's sarcastic remarks, and I have to stifle a laugh. But at the same time, I'm worried about how they'll treat her, with her quirky habits and unconventional appearance. Will they accept her for who she is, or will they try to change her to fit their own mold? The thought sends a pang of anxiety through my chest, and I realize that I need to prepare her for what's to come, to warn her about the potential pitfalls and landmines that lie ahead. I take a deep breath, trying to gather my thoughts and figure out where to start, as Anna looks up at me with an expectant expression, waiting for me to guide her through this uncharted territory."
"“Okay, okay. I’m on my way.” Slinging her purse over my shoulder and collecting our carry-ons, I make my way to the ladies’ room, where","Anna peeks out into the hallway.

I roll my eyes good-naturedly and take my place beside her in front of the mirror, where she's reapplying her lipstick for what feels like the hundredth time. ""Come on, Emily, we're going to miss our flight,"" I remind her, trying to hurry her along as I smooth out my own travel-wrinkled dress. But she just gives me a stern look and continues to blot her lips, her eyes fixed intently on her reflection. I sigh and lean against the counter, watching as she carefully reapplies her mascara, her hands moving with the precision of a surgeon. It's moments like these that I'm reminded of just how different we are, despite being sisters. While I'm happy to throw on the first thing I find on the floor and call it a day, Emily is a meticulous planner, always making sure every hair is in place and every accessory is perfectly coordinated. As we finally exit the ladies' room and make our way to the gate, I can feel her eyes on me, critiquing my outfit and no doubt making a mental note to take me shopping as soon as possible. I just smile and shake my head, used to her antics by now, and follow her onto the plane, ready to start our adventure together."

Her eyes go round. “The fam—” Anna shakes her head. “You know what? Never mind. Of,"course you have a plane.” Straightening, she asks, “So, why was I in Cambodia? Photography? Fabric design?”","course, it wasn't important, or at least that's what Anna tried to tell herself as she quickly changed the subject,",33,"course, it wasn't important, or at least that's what Anna tried to tell herself as she quickly changed the subject, asking her friend about the upcoming party and whether she had given any more thought to what they would wear, but the question still lingered in the back of her mind, refusing to be dismissed so easily, and she found herself wondering what her family would think if they knew the truth, and whether it would change anything, or if it would simply be another one of those secrets that everyone knew but never spoke of, like the elephant in the room that nobody dared to acknowledge."
"Once, when we were roommates, Anna flew to Seattle with a friend. It had been her first time on an airplane, and she struggled so much navigating the travel website that she brought me her laptop at midnight and asked for help. I finished the transaction for her, prebooked the car","to the airport, and then quietly tracked the ride the day she left to make sure she got there okay.

After that, she was so grateful that she offered to take me out for dinner as a thank you, and we ended up having a great time trying out a new restaurant in town. As it turned out, her trip to Seattle was a huge success, and she came back with amazing stories and photos of the city's iconic landmarks, including the Space Needle and Pike Place Market. She was particularly excited about the food scene, having tried some of the freshest seafood she'd ever had, and even brought back a box of famous Seattle chocolates for us to share. The experience seemed to have given her a newfound confidence in traveling, and soon she was planning her next adventure, this time to explore the East Coast. I was happy to see her so enthusiastic about discovering new places, and I looked forward to hearing all about her future travels and the memories she would make along the way."

I feel her looking at me for a quiet beat. “I think you’re joking. I’m,not sure.” Anna downs the rest of her prosecco. “A hint of danger.

"I walk back inside, realizing I’d been so focused on the sleeping situation, I haven’t properly flailed over the sheer bliss that is our bungalow.

"But because this is a Weston Party™, it doesn’t end there. Clustered down the center of each table are vases bursting with white orchids and sprays of spiky green palms.

The napkins are folded into intricate designs, and the silverware gleams with a soft, muted light, as if polished to perfection by skilled hands. At the head of each table, a majestic candelabra stands tall, its candles flickering softly, casting a warm, golden glow over the assembled guests. The air is filled with the sweet scent of the orchids, mingling with the faint hint of fine cuisine wafting from the kitchen, teasing the senses and building anticipation for the feast to come. As the guests take their seats, the soft hum of conversation fills the room, punctuated by the occasional clinking of glasses and the gentle rustle of fine fabrics, creating a symphony of sound that is quintessentially Weston Party™."

His eyes had a distant look, and his usual tough exterior had been cracked, revealing a deeper vulnerability that I hadn't seen before. I remembered the way he used to be, always so strong and in control, but now he seemed fragile, like he was barely holding it together. I wanted to reach out to him, to offer some kind of comfort, but I didn't know where to start. We had never been the type to talk about our feelings or show affection, so it felt awkward to try to do so now. Still, I knew I had to try, for his sake as well as my own. I took a deep breath and walked over to him, putting a hand on his shoulder in a gesture of support. ""Hey, you okay?"" I asked, trying to sound casual despite the concern that was growing inside me. He looked up at me, his eyes searching, and for a moment, I thought I saw a glimmer of tears. But then he looked away, clearing his throat, and I knew he was trying to brush it off. ""Yeah, I'm fine,"" he said gruffly, but I knew he wasn't. Not by a long shot."

As I sat there, trying to process the loss of my grandfather and the somber atmosphere that filled the room, I remember feeling a sense of detachment from the legal jargon and the discussions about assets and liabilities. It wasn't until much later, when I was older and had a better understanding of the family's history and dynamics, that I began to grasp the full implications of the will and the impact it had on our family's relationships and future. The reading of the will marked the beginning of a new era for us, one filled with changes, challenges, and ultimately, a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place within the family legacy. Over time, I came to realize that the will was not just a legal document but a reflection of my grandfather's values, wishes, and the love he had for each of us, which continues to guide us to this day."
