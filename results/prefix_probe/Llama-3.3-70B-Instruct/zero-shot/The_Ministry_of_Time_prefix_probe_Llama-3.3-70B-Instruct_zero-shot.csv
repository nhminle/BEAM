"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking.

Graham, however, had proven to be one of the more resilient ones, adapting quickly to the marvels and challenges of the 21st century. His naval background had given him a certain discipline and flexibility that served him well in this new world. As he navigated the complexities of modern society, he found himself drawn to the historical reenactment communities, where he could share his knowledge and experience with others who, though not from his time, shared his passion for the past. Despite the initial culture shock and the ache of leaving behind everything he knew and loved, Graham began to find a new sense of purpose in this strange, new world. He started to see the potential for a new life, one that blended his past experiences with the opportunities of the present, and he was determined to make the most of this second chance. The question of how to contribute to this new society, given his unique background, was a challenge he was eager to tackle, and he spent many hours discussing his options with the team that had brought him here, seeking a way to make his presence meaningful and beneficial to both himself and the world around him."
"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into","his eighties.

The interior, however, had been thoroughly modernized, with sleek lines and minimalist decor that seemed to clash with the ornate facade. Despite this, the house had a certain charm, its high ceilings and large windows letting in a flood of natural light that made the space feel airy and expansive. As Gore settled into his new surroundings, he couldn't help but feel a sense of disconnection from the world outside, the quiet suburban street a far cry from the bustling city he was used to. The Ministry had, of course, seen fit to provide him with all the amenities he might need, from a state-of-the-art kitchen to a high-speed internet connection, but despite these comforts, Gore couldn't shake the feeling that he was living in a bubble, cut off from the rest of humanity. He spent his days pacing the empty rooms, trying to make sense of the strange new world he found himself in, and wondering what the future held for him in this strange, isolated existence."

As you open the lid, a gentle hum fills the air, and a soft light illuminates the interior, revealing the neatly arranged items. You notice a small note attached to the inside of the lid, with a message that reads: ""Help yourself, and don't forget to refill when you're done."" The note seems to be written in a friendly, cursive script, and it adds a personal touch to the otherwise ordinary refrigerator. You wonder who might have written the note and why they chose to leave such a thoughtful gesture. As you ponder this, you hear the sound of footsteps approaching, and you turn to see who's coming."
"Gore was already fully dressed and sitting on the edge of the bath, smoking. The bottom of the bath",had a low-tide mark of cigarette ash and soap scum.

He stared blankly at the wall, the smoke from his cigarette curling lazily upwards, as he lost himself in thought. The sound of running water from the faucet created a soothing background hum, a constant reminder of the mundane routines that bookended the chaos of his life. His eyes, red-rimmed from lack of sleep, seemed to hold a thousand unspoken words, each one a testament to the turmoil brewing beneath his stoic exterior. The air was thick with the scent of soap and shampoo, a stark contrast to the darkness that lurked within him, waiting to spill out into the world. As he sat there, the silence was only broken by the occasional flick of his wrist, sending ashes tumbling into the toilet bowl, a mindless gesture that belied the intensity of his inner struggle."
"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale. A vile smell was seeping up from the floor.","leak from the water-supply line was creating a small puddle on the floor, and the air was thick with the smell",39,"leak from the water-supply line was creating a small puddle on the floor, and the air was thick with the smell of smoke and dampness. Gore, seemingly oblivious to the chaos around him, continued to puff on his cigarette, his eyes fixed on some point in the distance. As the morning wore on, the sound of dripping water and the occasional cough from Gore were the only sounds that broke the silence. It was as if time itself was standing still, waiting for something to happen, for some spark to ignite the events that would unfold. The atmosphere was tense, heavy with anticipation, and yet, nothing seemed to be happening. The stillness was oppressive, making it hard to breathe, and the smoke from Gore's cigarette only added to the sense of suffocation. Suddenly, without warning, Gore stubbed out his cigarette and stood up, his movements abrupt and jerky, like a puppet on a string. He walked over to the leaking water-supply line and stared at it, his eyes narrowing as he tried to make sense of the situation. The sound of dripping water seemed to grow louder, more insistent, and Gore's gaze seemed to bore into the very heart of the leak, as if willing it to stop. And then, just as suddenly as he had stood up, Gore turned and walked away, leaving the leak to continue its steady drip, drip, drip, into the puddle on the floor."
"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer. I’m sure he knew plenty about ship’s rigging, but he’d probably never handled an instrument more technologically complex than a sextant.

The transition from sail to steam, and later to more advanced technologies, required a distinct set of skills that not all sailors from the Age of Sail possessed. Gore, like many of his contemporaries, would have had to adapt quickly to these changes, learning about the inner workings of engines, the principles of steam power, and the various tools and instruments that came with these new technologies. This period of naval history was marked by a significant shift in how ships were powered and controlled, moving away from the reliance on wind and human labor to a more mechanized form of propulsion. The introduction of steam power, for instance, allowed for greater control over a ship's speed and direction, regardless of the weather conditions. However, it also introduced new challenges, such as the need for constant maintenance of the engines and the management of coal supplies. Officers like Gore, who were accustomed to the more traditional ways of sailing, had to undergo a process of reeducation to effectively command these new vessels. This involved not just understanding the technical aspects of steam power but also learning how to manage the crew in this new environment, as the skills required to handle a steam-powered ship differed significantly from those needed for sailing vessels. The era was filled with stories of officers who struggled to adapt, as well as those who embraced the change and became pioneers in the development of naval technology. Gore's story, while not detailed here, would likely reflect the broader trends of his time, a mix of tradition, innovation, and the challenges of adapting to a rapidly changing world."
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people. Hunting was out of the question, and socializing was limited by order of the Ministry.

His love for the arts was evident in the way he spoke about the masters, with a deep understanding and appreciation that was both captivating and inspiring. As I delved deeper into his world, I found myself drawn to his passion for life, his zest for experience, and his unwavering commitment to his values. He had a way of making everyone around him feel seen and heard, a gift that few people possess. His eyes sparkled with a mischievous glint when he talked about his adventures, and his laughter was infectious, able to light up even the darkest of rooms. Despite his many accomplishments, he remained humble and kind, never once flaunting his achievements or seeking to draw attention to himself. Instead, he preferred to listen, to learn, and to grow, always seeking to expand his knowledge and understanding of the world around him. As I reflect on the time I spent with Gore, I am reminded of the profound impact he had on my life, and the lessons he taught me about the importance of living a life that is true to oneself, with passion, purpose, and integrity."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea.

His eyes would gleam with a mixture of fascination and disconnection as he attempted to reconcile the two worlds, the old and the new, that coexisted within him. This sense of detachment allowed him to observe the modern world with a unique perspective, as if he were an anthropologist studying a foreign culture. He would often remark on the peculiar customs and rituals of contemporary society, from the way people stared at small, glowing rectangles in their hands to the strange, packaged foods they consumed on the go. Despite his somewhat antiquated demeanor, Gore possessed a sharp mind and a quick wit, which he used to navigate the complexities of the modern era with a mix of humor and curiosity. As he walked through the city streets, he would point out the remnants of a bygone era, the old buildings and landmarks that still stood as testaments to the past, and he would speak of the people who had lived and worked there, their stories and struggles, their triumphs and tragedies. In this way, Gore brought the past to life, weaving a rich tapestry of history and experience that was both deeply personal and universally relatable."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake.

The anticipation of this moment had kept me up at night, my mind racing with scenarios and potential outcomes. I had grown accustomed to the freedom that came with being misunderstood, with being seen as something I was not. It was a fragile freedom, one that relied on the silence I maintained and the stories I chose not to tell. But as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, I began to feel the weight of this silence, the burden of carrying a truth that was not mine to keep. I started to question whether the comfort of being invisible was worth the cost of being unknown, of being a stranger even to those closest to me. The line between honesty and deception had grown blurred, and I found myself standing at the edge of a precipice, unsure of which path to take or what the consequences of my choice would be. As I navigated this uncertain landscape, I couldn't help but wonder what it would mean to be seen, truly seen, for the first time in my life."

The air is crisp and cold, with a hint of salt and seaweed, and the crew can see their breath as they work to keep the ship on course. Despite the challenges they face, the crew remains resolute, driven by a sense of adventure and discovery that has brought them to this remote and inhospitable corner of the world. As the ship presses on, the crew begins to notice a change in the ice, a subtle shift in the patterns and colors that suggests they may be approaching a previously unknown region, one that could hold secrets and surprises beyond their wildest imagination."
"Once we arrived at the Ministry, an escort of subtly armed suits took Gore to meet the other expats.

The atmosphere was relaxed, almost too casual for the setting, and I couldn't help but wonder what the true purpose of this gathering was. As Gore mingled with the others, I noticed a woman standing by the window, her eyes fixed on him with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. She introduced herself as Sophia, a journalist from a neighboring country, and began to ask Gore questions about his background and the nature of his work. The conversation flowed easily, but I sensed an undercurrent of tension, a feeling that there was more at play here than met the eye. Meanwhile, I observed the other expats, each with their own secrets and motivations, and wondered what had brought them to this point, and what they hoped to achieve in this complex and often unforgiving environment."

"“We can’t risk the temporal repercussions,” said Adela. “They are supposed to be dead. As long as they’re here, it’s functionally as if they are dead in","their own time.

Their presence here, in this time and place, threatened to unravel the very foundations of reality. The team had to act quickly to prevent a disaster, but the question was, how could they possibly return these individuals to their own time without causing further damage to the timeline? The stakes were high, and the margin for error was nonexistent. One wrong move could spell disaster, not just for the timeline, but for the entire universe. Adela knew that she had to make a decision, and fast, before the situation spiraled out of control. She called an emergency meeting with her team to discuss their options and come up with a plan to mitigate the risks and find a way to safely return the individuals to their own time.

As we approached him, he didn't flinch, his gaze remaining steadfast, and it was then that I noticed a small, almost imperceptible tremble in his hand, a subtle betrayal of the turmoil that might be brewing beneath his otherwise calm exterior. The sunlight, now beginning to wane, cast long shadows across the floor, stretching and twisting like dark, ethereal fingers, as if trying to reach out and snuff out the last remnants of light in the room. It was a moment suspended in time, heavy with anticipation and foreboding, a moment that seemed to hold its breath in wait for what was to come next, and I couldn't help but feel that we were all standing on the precipice of something momentous, something that would change the course of our lives forever."
"We went for lunch at a small bistro near the Ministry. Gore came from an era of service à la française, private dining rooms and putting everything into jelly.

The bistro, with its cozy atmosphere and simple yet elegant decor, was a far cry from the opulent settings he was accustomed to. As we perused the menu, Gore's eyes widened at the array of dishes, and he marveled at the concept of ordering individual plates rather than a predetermined, multi-course meal. I watched with amusement as he struggled to decide between the various options, his mind still rooted in the formalities of his past. Eventually, he settled on a classic dish, and as we waited for our food to arrive, he regaled me with stories of lavish dinner parties and high-society gatherings, where the art of conversation and etiquette reigned supreme. His tales transported me to a bygone era, one of refinement and luxury, and I found myself enchanted by the charm and sophistication that seemed to emanate from every pore of his being. As our lunch arrived, Gore's eyes lit up, and he dove into his meal with gusto, savoring each bite and declaring it to be a culinary masterpiece. In that moment, I realized that despite the differences in our backgrounds and experiences, we shared a common appreciation for the simple pleasures in life, and that sometimes, it's the unexpected encounters that lead to the most memorable and enriching experiences."
"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to",take us to”—here he raised his eyebrows—“a public house.

As we walked further along the river, he pointed out several other features of the landscape that he believed would be useful in our future endeavors, from hidden caves to secluded clearings, each one carefully noted and committed to memory. It was clear that Gore had been thinking about this for a long time, and I found myself wondering what other secrets he might be hiding, and what the true purpose of this elaborate plan might be.

Gore ordered us a couple of whiskeys and we sat down at a small table by the window, watching as the stars began to twinkle in the night sky. As we sipped our drinks, he started to open up to me about his life, sharing stories about his childhood and his family, and I found myself feeling a sense of connection to this quiet, unassuming man. The more he talked, the more I realized that there was a depth to him that I had not initially noticed, a complexity that went beyond his awkward exterior. As the night wore on, I began to see Gore in a new light, and our conversation flowed easily, like we had known each other for years. The drink turned into several, and before I knew it, the pub was closing, and we were stumbling out into the cool night air, laughing and joking like old friends.

Ralph, being the head of the department, was not amused to see one of his employees fraternizing with someone who was essentially spying on them. The situation was made even more uncomfortable by the fact that the employee in question, a young man named Alex, had been acting strangely for weeks, always seeming to be lurking around the edges of meetings and conversations, never quite contributing but always listening intently. It was as if he had been waiting for something, or someone, and Ralph's encounter with the Defence tracker had apparently set off a chain reaction that would change everything. The atmosphere in the office grew increasingly tense as the days passed, with everyone wondering what exactly was going on and what Alex's true loyalties were. Some people began to suspect that he was more than just a curious employee, that he might be a plant, sent to gather information and report back to his handlers. The speculation was rampant, and it seemed that no one knew what to believe or who to trust. As the tension continued to build, it became clear that something was about to give, and the consequences would be far-reaching and potentially devastating."

"Graham used other words too, not wrong, exactly, but not right, like “your people,” or “your culture.” When I said, in a wincingly tight voice, that we had the same people and culture, he replied, mildly, “But I don’t think that we do.” Then came the image searches about Cambodia, on food and dress","and customs.

The more we talked, the more I realized that our perspectives were shaped by our individual upbringings and environments, and that our understanding of the world was filtered through different lenses. As the conversation progressed, I began to see that Graham's words, though sometimes awkwardly phrased, were not meant to be divisive, but rather a genuine attempt to understand and acknowledge the complexities of our diverse backgrounds. Despite the initial discomfort, our discussion eventually led to a deeper exploration of the nuances of identity, culture, and belonging, and I found myself appreciating Graham's willingness to engage in an open and honest dialogue, even if it meant confronting the uncomfortable realities of our differences. As we delved deeper into the conversation, I started to notice the subtle ways in which our language and terminology influenced our perceptions, and how the words we chose to use could either bridge or widen the gaps between us. The experience left me with a renewed sense of awareness about the importance of empathy and effective communication in navigating the intricacies of human relationships, and the need to approach each interaction with a willingness to listen, learn, and understand the unique perspectives of others."

The Brigadier, sensing the young man's uncertainty, offered words of encouragement and guidance, drawing from his own experiences to illustrate the importance of perseverance and determination.

The captain, being an experienced sailor and cartographer, had been leading the expedition to explore the uncharted territories of the Australian wilderness. As they navigated through the dense foliage and winding waterways, the crew had been on high alert for any signs of danger, from wild animals to treacherous terrain. But nothing could have prepared them for the sudden explosion that rocked the small boat, sending splinters of wood and metal flying in all directions. The captain's quick thinking and decisive action had saved his crew from certain disaster, but not before the young man had suffered a severe injury to his hand. Despite the pain and trauma, he had managed to recover, and the wound had eventually healed, leaving behind only a faint scar as a reminder of that fateful day. However, the memory of the incident still lingered, a testament to the risks and uncertainties of exploration and the importance of vigilance in the face of the unknown. As he sat now, lost in thought, the old wound seemed to throb with a newfound sense of significance, as if it held a secret or a lesson that he had yet to fully grasp."
"It’s surprising, then, that I allowed Graham’s drawing of the projection device to enter my files as a joke, like a coin minted 70 BC.

But as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, I found myself returning to the drawing again and again, studying the intricate lines and shapes that Graham had rendered with such precision. I began to see it as more than just a joke, more than just a relic of a bygone era. It was a window into a different way of thinking, a way of seeing the world that was both familiar and strange. I started to wonder if there was more to the drawing than met the eye, if it was more than just a simple sketch. I decided to investigate further, to see if I could uncover the secrets that lay hidden beneath the surface of Graham's seemingly innocuous drawing. As I delved deeper, I discovered a world of hidden meanings and symbolism, a world that challenged my perceptions and forced me to question everything I thought I knew. The drawing had become an obsession, a puzzle that I was determined to solve, no matter where it might lead. And so, I continued to study it, pouring over every detail, every line and curve, until the truth finally began to reveal itself, like a ghostly image emerging from the shadows."
"By the start of that summer, Graham was practically a native of the era. He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle. Most mornings he rose—hours before me—and",went for a run. He would sometimes wake me up with a juicy smoker’s wheeze on his return to the house.

As the days went by, I noticed him becoming increasingly fascinated with the local community, often striking up conversations with our neighbors and learning about their daily lives. He developed a particular interest in the history of the town, spending hours at the local library, poring over old records and speaking with the town's elderly residents. His transformation was nothing short of remarkable, and I found myself wondering how someone could so seamlessly adapt to a new environment. Despite his initial struggles, Graham had managed to find a sense of belonging in this small town, and it was heartwarming to see him so at peace. As the summer solstice approached, Graham began to make plans for a grand garden party, inviting all of our neighbors and acquaintances to join us for an evening of food, drink, and merriment. The prospect of hosting such an event seemed to bring him immense joy, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation as the big day drew near."
"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past. I was prickly and defensive about","this; I could not look at why directly. I heard the way I spoke to him about it: adjustment, reasonable, citizen, responsibility, values. He blew a lot of pensive cigarette smoke at me.","the way he would often criticize the modern world, as if its advancements and innovations were somehow less authentic than the experiences of his youth.

His nostalgia for the past was palpable, and it sometimes put me on edge, making me feel like I was stuck in the middle of a generational tug-of-war. I wanted to understand where he was coming from, to see the world through his eyes and comprehend the depth of his feelings, but it was hard when his disapproval felt so personal. I would try to explain to him the benefits of technology, the ways in which it had improved our lives and connected us to the world in ways previously unimaginable, but he would just shake his head and mutter about the loss of simplicity and the erosion of traditional values. It was a cycle we repeated often, each of us trying to convince the other of our perspective, yet neither of us willing to fully concede. Despite the tension it created, I valued these conversations, difficult as they were, because they forced me to think critically about my own relationship with the world and my place within it. They made me realize that my own views were not absolute, that there were other ways to experience and interpret reality, and that sometimes, the most profound understanding comes from embracing the complexity of differing perspectives."
"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them. Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled","to focus on the tests—eyes moving rapidly. I once found him the sole occupant of the fifth-floor smoking area (a pigeon-shit-encrusted balcony), methodically shredding a filter of a finished cigarette.

The beeping of the machines and the smell of disinfectant brought back a wave of nausea, and he had to be reassured multiple times that this was just a simulation. The researchers, however, were not deterred by the initial setbacks and decided to take a different approach. They moved the tests to a more neutral environment, a large conference room with plain white walls and minimal decor, in an attempt to reduce the anxiety levels of the expats. The tests themselves were also modified, with more emphasis on virtual reality simulations and less on physical stimuli. This seemed to yield better results, as the expats were able to respond more naturally to the scenarios presented to them. Graham, in particular, showed significant improvement, his heart rate and blood pressure returning to normal as he navigated the virtual environments. The researchers were eager to analyze the data and see if they could identify any patterns or correlations between the expats' reactions and their cultural backgrounds. As the tests continued, they began to notice some interesting trends, with certain groups of expats exhibiting similar responses to specific stimuli. This sparked a lively debate among the researchers, with some arguing that these trends were evidence of a collective cultural psyche, while others attributed them to individual differences and personal experiences. The discussion was ongoing, but one thing was clear: the results of these tests had the potential to revolutionize the field of cross-cultural psychology and shed new light on the complex and multifaceted nature of human emotions."
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons.

The test was meant to assess their ability to understand and share the feelings of others, but it ended up causing more distress than insight. The researchers were forced to reevaluate their methods and consider the potential consequences of pushing their subjects too far. As a result, they decided to introduce more gentle and nuanced approaches to measuring empathy, such as role-playing exercises and scenario-based discussions. This shift in approach led to more productive and informative results, allowing the researchers to better understand the complexities of empathy in their subjects. Meanwhile, the expats, including Nineteen-sixteen, Sixteen-forty-five, and Graham, were given time to recover and process their emotions, and they eventually became more receptive to the new methods. The researchers also made sure to provide them with adequate support and counseling to deal with any lingering trauma or anxiety caused by the initial test. As the study progressed, the expats began to open up and share their thoughts and feelings more freely, providing valuable insights into the human experience and the nature of empathy."

The smile, such as it was, seemed to be a mere mockery, a faint echo of happier times, and it only served to accentuate the overall air of desperation that clung to her like a bad omen. As she stood there, her entire being seemed to radiate a sense of quiet desperation, a feeling that she was clinging to the edge of a precipice, her fingers slipping, and that one wrong move would send her tumbling into the abyss."

He turned a corner, and the sight of a small, quaint shop caught his eye, its windows filled with an assortment of peculiar items that seemed to whisper tales of their own. Without hesitation, Graham pushed open the door, and a bell above it rang out, announcing his arrival into a world that was both familiar and unknown."

As the heat wave dragged on, I began to feel like I was trapped in some kind of never-ending nightmare, with no escape from the suffocating heat. I longed for the coolness of autumn, for the feeling of walking outside without instantly breaking a sweat, but it seemed like a distant memory, a fleeting dream that I couldn't quite grasp. The heat wave had become my reality, and I was forced to endure it, one sweltering day at a time. Eventually, I started to notice the small things, like the way the sunlight streaming through the window highlighted the dust particles dancing in the air, or the sound of children playing in the distance, their laughter and shouts a stark contrast to the oppressive atmosphere that had settled over our household.

She quickly turned off the tap, dried her hands, and glanced around the small, dimly lit kitchen, making sure she was still alone.

Her sharp tongue and dismissive tone made even the most confident colleagues squirm in their seats, and her constant reminders of deadlines and schedules only served to heighten the sense of unease that pervaded the office. Despite her icy demeanor, however, there were whispers of a more vulnerable side to Adela, one that only emerged when she was alone in her office, staring out the window with a look of wistful longing on her face. But these glimpses were rare, and for the most part, Adela remained an impenetrable fortress, impervious to the needs and feelings of those around her. As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, the office became a battleground, with Adela's sharp wit and sarcasm pitted against the growing resentment and frustration of her colleagues. It was a war of attrition, with no end in sight, and one that would ultimately leave only one person standing."
"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had","just discovered that a woman with whom he was spending a lot of time would never be interested in him.

As our eyes met, I felt a jolt of connection, a sense of understanding that transcended words. The air around us seemed to vibrate with unspoken emotions, and I found myself wanting to reach out, to bridge the gap between us. But I hesitated, unsure of how to navigate the fragile terrain of his feelings. Graham, too, seemed frozen, his eyes locked on mine with a mixture of trepidation and longing. The silence between us grew, a palpable thing that pulsed with possibility, until finally, he spoke, his voice low and husky, sending shivers down my spine. ""I'm sorry,"" he said, the words tumbling out in a rush, ""I didn't mean to...I just..."" He trailed off, his face reddening further, and I knew in that moment that I had to respond, to let him know that I saw him, that I understood. But what could I say? That I, too, felt the weight of my own secrets, my own fears? That I, too, was struggling to find my place in the world? The words swirled in my mind, a jumbled mess of emotions and half-truths, as I searched for a way to connect with this beautiful, broken man."
"Graham blew smoke out through his nose reflectively. “I see,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s fair to call him ‘grim,’ though you wouldn’t be the","first to say it.

As Graham pondered this, he recalled instances where the man in question had shown a dry, witty sense of humor, revealing a more complex personality beneath his reserved exterior. This contrast between appearance and reality sparked Graham's curiosity, and he found himself wanting to learn more about the man, to understand what lay behind the façade he presented to the world. Perhaps, Graham thought, there was more to him than met the eye, a depth that only revealed itself to those who took the time to look beyond the surface level. With this in mind, Graham decided that he would make an effort to get to know the man better, to explore the nuances of his personality and discover the truth behind his enigmatic presence."
"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders. The bridges kept turning in their core reports, and the experiments kept running. Given how much of our working day the data collection took, we all assumed that the time-travel project was running to the stated purpose. Every day I had to record his heart rate, his blood pressure, his temperature; every day a written record of what he wore, what he ate, how much","exercise he took; every week checking progress against the imaginary benchmarks set by Control, use of phone, use of transport, use of media and the assessment of how harmful or useful each medium was; all the time the corrective tests for vocabulary and habit; novelistic observations on his character and temperament.

My only reality was the lab, the equipment, and the subject of our experiments, who remained as enigmatic and mysterious as ever. Despite the familiarity of our daily routine, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that there were underlying currents and motivations that I was not privy to. Adela's silence on the matter of the ""vital"" files only added to my unease, and I found myself wondering what secrets lay hidden beneath the surface of our seemingly mundane work. The subject, too, seemed to be hiding something, his eyes often glinting with a knowing light that made me feel like I was missing out on some private joke. As the months dragged on, my curiosity grew, and I began to feel an increasing sense of restlessness, a sense that I was trapped in a world that was not of my making, and that I needed to find a way to escape. But for now, I was stuck in this never-ending cycle of data collection and observation, a small cog in a much larger machine that seemed to be driving me towards some unknown destination. And so I continued to record the subject's heart rate, his blood pressure, and his temperature, waiting for something, anything, to happen, to break the monotony of our daily routine and reveal the secrets that lay hidden beneath the surface of our time-travel project."
"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events. He’d lain motionless in the garden for two hours, on","a wet and putrid night, to shoot a fox, and pulled out one of his own rotting teeth (he showed it to me afterward; it was the color of a tombstone, caped with gelatinous red)—was this Victorian, or was this “irregularities”?","the warm stone patio, his eyes fixed on some point beyond the horizon, his chest rising and falling with a slow, deliberate rhythm.

It was as if he had become one with the landscape, a statue carved from the same earth and stone that surrounded him. I had tried to rouse him, to shake him out of his trance-like state, but he had merely blinked slowly and returned to his vigil. The sun had beat down on us, warming the air and baking the earth, but Graham hadn't flinched, hadn't even shifted his gaze. I had grown concerned, wondering if he was okay, if he was experiencing some kind of episode, but as the hours passed, I began to feel a sense of unease, a creeping feeling that something was off, that Graham was waiting for something, or someone. The air was thick with tension, heavy with anticipation, and I found myself glancing over my shoulder, expecting to see something, or someone, emerging from the trees. But there was nothing, just the sound of birds singing and the rustle of leaves in the breeze. And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, Graham sat up, his eyes snapping back into focus, and he looked at me with an intensity that made my heart skip a beat. ""What is it?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady, but he just shook his head and stood up, brushing off his pants and walking back to the house without a word."
"So I was anxious about Graham’s disdain for the twenty-first century, because never mind that I felt rejected by it, I was worried that the universe would feel the atemporal sting of his contempt and take","him away.

I envisioned a scenario where the fabric of time itself would unravel, thread by thread, as a direct consequence of Graham's scorn. His disregard for the advancements and innovations of the modern era seemed to me like a personal affront to the very essence of progress. I feared that his negative energy would create a ripple effect, disturbing the delicate balance of the universe and potentially causing irreparable damage to the space-time continuum. The thought sent shivers down my spine as I contemplated the possibility of Graham's disdain having far-reaching and devastating consequences, not just for our personal lives, but for the world at large. As I stood there, lost in my anxious reverie, I couldn't help but wonder if it was already too late, if the universe had already begun to feel the effects of Graham's contempt, and if we were merely pawns in a much larger, more complex game. The uncertainty was suffocating, and I knew I had to find a way to address Graham's issues with the twenty-first century before it was too late, not just for his sake, but for the sake of the universe itself."
"I persuaded Graham to use the tiny office, in which I ordinarily worked, to cram for the test. The Ministry gave no indication of what format","the test would take, or what manner of questions would be asked, or tasks set.

I had seen him tackle tough challenges before, and I had every confidence that he would rise to this occasion as well. But as the test drew nearer, even I began to feel a twinge of doubt - what if Graham wasn't as prepared as we thought? What if the test was somehow different from what we had expected? I pushed the thoughts aside and focused on helping Graham review, but the uncertainty lingered, refusing to be shaken. Finally, the day of the test arrived, and Graham set off early in the morning, looking determined but also more than a little nervous. I waited anxiously for his return, wondering how it had gone and whether all our hard work had paid off."

The air was thick with unspoken questions, and I couldn't help but wonder what had brought this person to our gathering, and what they hoped to achieve by being there. As the moments ticked by, the silence began to feel oppressive, and I found myself longing for some kind of resolution, or at least a hint of what was to come.

"I went home and, on arrival, checked my emails. As with a driving",test—or the lieutenants’ exam—the acclimatization exam results were delivered immediately.

"I cycled up to the nice grocery store to buy a bottle of champagne, pausing on the way home for a soft-serve ice cream. I sat on the bench to lick the ripple into a mound and think about the","Brigadier.

I thought about all the late nights, early mornings, and endless cups of coffee that had led up to this point. The ripple of the ice cream began to melt, and I quickly licked it back into shape, lost in thought. The world around me seemed to slow down, and all that mattered was the present moment, the taste of the ice cream, and the promise of the celebration to come. As I finished my treat, I got back on my bike, feeling a sense of anticipation and joy, ready to pop the cork and let the festivities begin."
"“Apparently I can pass as an eccentric. I suggested that somewhere like Scotland, Arthur and I might","simply pass as Englishmen.

Arthur, ever the skeptic, raised an eyebrow at my suggestion, but I could see the faintest glimmer of interest in his eyes, and I knew that with a bit of persuasion, he might just agree to give it a try. After all, what did we have to lose, really? We'd been living in the city for years, and while it had its advantages, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were just going through the motions, stuck in a rut of routine and familiarity. Scotland, on the other hand, represented a chance for adventure, a chance to break free from the constraints of our old lives and forge a new path, one that was ours alone."
"When I brought the glass up—stoppering the rest of the bottle for dinner—I could hear Graham singing “I love to steal awhile away,” occasionally muffled by his drags on a cigarette. Water plashed against the tub.","He dropped to humming and presumably soaping. I slid quietly to the floor and leaned my head against the wall. I wasn’t going to see a Ministry therapist.

As I closed my eyes, the water lapped gently against the sides of the tub, and I let out a contented sigh, feeling the tension of the day melt away. Graham's voice trailed off, and I heard the creak of the floorboards as he walked back into the room, the soft clink of ice in a glass as he refreshed his drink. The silence that followed was companionable, a sense of ease and tranquility settling over us like a warm blanket. I opened my eyes to find Graham standing in the doorway, a look of relaxed happiness on his face, his eyes crinkled at the corners as he smiled at me. ""You look like you're enjoying that,"" he said, nodding towards the wine, and I smiled back, feeling grateful for this quiet moment, this sense of peace, in the midst of a chaotic world."
"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century.

Nevertheless, he had taken to cooking in a way he had failed to take to","television or texting or the use of deodorants (“I bathe every day,” he’d said to me with hurt dignity). Tonight, he hummed with a busyness that hardly shielded nervousness. He burned the onions and automatically reached for his cigarettes.

And so, he spent hours poring over cookbooks, experimenting with new recipes, and practicing the techniques that would allow him to create dishes that were not only edible but actually enjoyable. His progress was slow, but steady, and he took pride in each small success, no matter how insignificant it may have seemed to others.

Her hair, a rich cascade of curly brown locks, bounced with each step, and the delicate lace trim on her blouse sparkled in the sunlight, adding a touch of whimsy to her overall appearance. Despite the modern surroundings, Margaret exuded a nostalgic charm, as if she had stepped out of a time capsule and into the present, bringing with her the essence of a forgotten era. Her confidence and poise only added to the allure, making her a true head-turner in a crowd, and it was clear that she was a woman who knew her style and wasn't afraid to express it, no matter how bold or unconventional it may seem."

"Margaret, incidentally, listened to the men talk about their careers with a suffused urgency that only I noticed. In her own era, she’d slept in the room next to the one where she had been born.","She thought Scotland was far-flung and semi-barbaric.

Perhaps it was the fact that her own life had been marked by a sense of stability and routine, a stark contrast to the dynamic and ever-changing careers of the men. Whatever the reason, Margaret's engagement was palpable, and it added a unique dimension to the conversations, inviting the men to share more, to delve deeper into their passions and motivations. As the evening wore on, the room grew quieter, the only sound the crackling of the fireplace and the occasional clinking of glasses, but Margaret's attention never wavered, her gaze fixed intently on the speakers, drinking in every word. And I, too, found myself drawn into the narratives, my own thoughts and reflections stirred by the men's accounts, as the night unfolded like a rich tapestry, woven from the threads of their stories and our collective presence."
"How the topic of weed came up I couldn’t remember—probably during one of the vigorous debates about what the twenty-first century had genuinely improved, which in",the opinion of the expats was a mixed bag.

Some argued that it had significant therapeutic properties, citing cases where it had helped alleviate chronic pain and reduce symptoms of certain illnesses. Others were more skeptical, pointing to potential risks such as increased dependency and the impact on mental health. The debate was lively, with each side presenting compelling arguments, and it was clear that opinions on the matter were deeply divided. As the conversation progressed, we touched upon the cultural and historical aspects of marijuana use, from its ancient origins to its modern-day applications, and how societal attitudes towards it had evolved over time. It was fascinating to see how a topic that was once so taboo could now be discussed so openly, reflecting a broader shift in societal values and norms. The discussion eventually led to a broader exploration of drug policies and the challenges of balancing personal freedoms with public health concerns, highlighting the complexity of the issue and the need for ongoing research and dialogue."

The rise of music boxes has also led to a new era of music appreciation, with people from all walks of life able to access and enjoy a wide range of genres and styles, from classical to contemporary, and everything in between. Furthermore, the music boxes have enabled people to discover new artists and bands, and to explore different cultures and traditions, broadening their musical horizons and fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of the art form."

"As soon as she stepped in, I started making a tally of the evidence of unbeauty. There was a chair whose seat was filled with clothes too dirty for the wardrobe but too clean for the washing basket. My bedside table sprouted two water glasses and a mug. Dust crouched on the skirting boards and in the seams of","my chest of drawers. When a woman is as impossibly attractive as Margaret, the mediocrity shed by a woman like me bustles around her like a horde of pigeons. Or so I thought, at that time.

I could feel my anxiety spiking as I took in the mess, my mind racing with all the things that needed to be done to restore order. The sound of her footsteps echoed through the room as she moved closer, her eyes scanning the space with a mixture of curiosity and amusement. I could sense her gaze lingering on the piles of dirty laundry, the unwashed dishes, and the general disarray, and I felt a flush rise to my cheeks as I realized that she must think me a complete slob. But as she turned to me, a small smile playing on her lips, I saw something unexpected - a glimmer of understanding, of recognition, that suggested she knew exactly what it was like to be overwhelmed by the demands of daily life. And in that moment, I felt a spark of connection, a sense of solidarity that went beyond the surface level of messy rooms and dirty dishes, and spoke to something deeper and more profound."

"I’d stopped wearing it—I was, at the time, thinking of the way my face might be received by a Victorian who didn’t approve of cosmetics—but I demonstrated the coverage of my sole foundation. Margaret","was amazed by the smoothness of its application and the faithfulness of its shade. She drew an arrow with it on her cheek. On her fair skin, it looked like clay. We started giggling.","watched with a mixture of fascination and skepticism as I applied a small amount to my cheek, blending it seamlessly into my skin.

She raised an eyebrow, clearly impressed despite herself, and asked me to explain the ingredients and the process of its creation. I launched into a detailed explanation, discussing the various pigments and binders used, as well as the techniques employed to achieve such a natural finish. As I spoke, Margaret's expression transformed from one of mild curiosity to genuine interest, and she began to ask more probing questions about the potential applications of such a product. Her mind, it seemed, was racing with the possibilities, and I found myself caught up in her enthusiasm, imagining the ways in which this simple foundation could be used to challenge societal norms and expectations. Before long, we were deep in conversation, discussing everything from the cultural significance of makeup to the role of women in Victorian society, and I realized that my humble foundation had become a catalyst for a much larger and more meaningful discussion."

I smiled back, feeling a sense of gratitude towards this kind stranger, and reached for the coffee, savoring the aroma that filled the air. The nurse lingered for a moment, checking on Margaret's vitals before turning to leave, her footsteps quiet on the linoleum floor. As the door closed behind her, I took a sip of the coffee, feeling the warmth spread through my chest, and began to think about the events that had led me to this place, and what the future might hold for Margaret and me."
"All the expats had phones, paid for (and tapped) by the Ministry. Graham had switched his own phone on a total of three times in the seven","months he had been in the twenty-first century. I was therefore unsurprised when, about half an hour after their plane landed, I got a call from Arthur’s phone.","months he had been in the country, and each time it was to receive a brief, cryptic message from an unknown number, which he assumed was a test to see if he would",55,"months he had been in the country, and each time it was to receive a brief, cryptic message from an unknown number, which he assumed was a test to see if he would take the bait. The messages were always innocuous, but Graham's instincts told him to be cautious, to not engage with the mysterious sender. He had heard stories of expats being lured into traps, of being coerced into revealing sensitive information or compromising their own security. Graham was determined to keep a low profile, to blend in with the locals and avoid drawing attention to himself. He spent most of his days exploring the city, marveling at the ancient architecture and sampling the local cuisine. Despite the initial culture shock, he was starting to feel at home, to appreciate the rhythms and nuances of his new surroundings. But the phone, and the mysterious messages, remained a constant source of unease, a reminder that he was never truly alone, that his every move was being watched and monitored. As he walked through the bustling streets, Graham couldn't shake the feeling that he was being pulled into a web of intrigue, that his life was about to take a dramatic turn. He quickened his pace, his senses on high alert, as he navigated the crowded alleys and market stalls, searching for a glimpse of the truth, and a way to uncover the secrets that lay hidden in the shadows."
"Arthur was striding up the street, bent slightly against a wind which didn’t exist. He was wearing a tweed jacket and looked like a period piece,","but then again, so did Pimlico.

His eyes were fixed on some point in the distance, his brow furrowed in concentration. The people passing by couldn't help but glance at him, drawn in by the air of quiet intensity that surrounded him. Some of them did a double take, wondering if they had seen him before, perhaps in a film or a book. Arthur, however, was oblivious to the attention, his mind preoccupied with the task at hand. He turned a corner, his long strides eating up the distance, and disappeared into a small, quirky-looking shop that seemed to appear out of nowhere. The sign above the door read ""Curios and Antiques,"" and the windows were filled with a jumble of strange and fascinating objects that seemed to defy explanation. As Arthur pushed open the door, a bell above it rang out, and he stepped into a world that was both familiar and yet completely alien."
"It paid off in the early autumn.

My grandmother's eyes sparkled with curiosity as she carefully untied the twine and began to unwrap the paper, revealing a small, leather-bound book with strange symbols etched into the cover. As she opened the book, a faint scent of old parchment and forgotten knowledge wafted through the air, and I could sense that this mysterious package was about to change everything. With trembling hands, my grandmother began to turn the pages, her eyes scanning the yellowed paper as if searching for a specific passage or message. The room was filled with an air of anticipation, and I found myself leaning in, eager to catch a glimpse of the secrets that the book might hold. As the morning sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating the dust motes that danced in the air, my grandmother's eyes landed on a particular page, and her face lit up with a look of wonder and awe."
"Adela was of the “never been to the GP in my life because I’m not a pussy” school of care, and nothing changed. If the expats were","dangerously ill, they’d be removed to the wards and never mind the trigger; if they could get a grip and deal with it at home, they should.","going to influence her in any way, it would be through their stories of medical emergencies and the subsequent bills they had to pay, which",54,"going to influence her in any way, it would be through their stories of medical emergencies and the subsequent bills they had to pay, which were often exorbitant and a significant dent in their savings. Despite this, Adela remained resolute in her stance, often joking that she would rather take her chances than be seen as weak or, in her words, ""a hypochondriac."" Her friends and family found her attitude both amusing and concerning, as they had witnessed instances where her stubbornness had led to minor issues escalating into more serious health problems. The expats, however, seemed to have a different approach to healthcare, frequently visiting their doctors for check-ups and screenings, a practice that Adela found puzzling. As time passed, Adela began to notice the contrast between her approach to health and that of the expats, and while she didn't change her ways immediately, she started to consider the value of preventive care, especially when she saw how it had positively impacted the lives of those around her. This subtle shift in perspective was not a surrender to her previous beliefs but rather an acknowledgment that there might be a middle ground, one where strength and caution were not mutually exclusive. And so, Adela's journey towards a more balanced view of healthcare began, influenced by the diverse perspectives she encountered, marking the start of a significant change in her life."
"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs. Given the prevalence of prostitution in Victorian England, the nonexistence of reliable barrier contraception in his era, and the fact that he was a sailor, this suggested he was either a virgin or very lucky. But then again, I knew enough about his biography to know that he was very, very lucky.","of his file, which included a transcript of that particular session, and I must admit that I found Graham's response to be both intriguing and perplexing.

I couldn't help but wonder what he meant by that, and whether it was a reflection of his own desires or simply a commentary on the societal norms of the time. As I pondered this, I found myself feeling a mix of emotions - curiosity, concern, and a hint of frustration. I wanted to understand Graham better, to get inside his head and see the world from his perspective, but it seemed like the more I learned about him, the more mysterious he became. I decided to try and approach the subject with him again, to see if I could get him to open up and share more about his thoughts and feelings. But as I turned to him, I saw that he was lost in thought, staring out the window with a look of quiet contemplation on his face. I hesitated, unsure of whether to interrupt him or let him be, and in the end, I decided to let him be, hoping that he would come to me when he was ready to talk. The silence between us was comfortable, but also a bit unsettling, like the stillness before a storm. I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something brewing beneath the surface, something that would eventually erupt and change everything. And as I sat there, waiting and watching, I couldn't help but wonder what the future held for us, and whether we would be able to navigate the complexities of our relationship and find a way to truly connect with each other."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory.

As we delved into conversations about politics, culture, and social issues, I found myself torn between the desire to share my perspectives and the risk of overwhelming her with my own biases. The expat community was a unique beast, a melting pot of individuals from diverse backgrounds, each with their own stories and experiences. Margaret, in particular, seemed to embody this sense of curiosity, her questions probing and insightful, yet tinged with a naivety that was both refreshing and concerning. As I navigated these interactions, I couldn't help but ponder the responsibility that came with sharing one's knowledge and experiences, and the delicate balance between enlightening and influencing. The power dynamics at play were complex, with each of us bringing our own set of assumptions and preconceptions to the table. And yet, despite these challenges, there was an undeniable allure to the expat experience, a sense of freedom and possibility that was hard to resist. As I looked at Margaret, I saw a reflection of my own experiences, a sense of dislocation and discovery that was both exhilarating and terrifying. In that moment, I realized that the true power of knowledge lay not in its possession, but in its sharing, and the connections that it facilitated between individuals from different walks of life."

Despite the risks, Graham remained resolute, his determination a testament to the complexity of his character and the depth of his convictions. As I stood by him, I couldn't help but wonder what had driven him to this point, what fears or motivations had led him to choose this path, and how it would ultimately affect not just his own life, but the lives of those around him."
"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled. Then again, whose upper management am I not describing? Who trusts their workplace? Who thinks their job is on the side of right?

The weight of that uncertainty hung in the air, making it difficult for me to act decisively. In hindsight, I can see that my inaction was a result of my own fears and doubts, rather than any lack of suspicion. The question still lingers, though - what would have happened if I had seized the lever, if I had taken a different path? Would it have changed the course of events, or would it have led to a different set of problems? The what-ifs still haunt me, a reminder of the complexity of human decision-making and the unpredictability of outcomes. As I grapple with these questions, I am forced to confront my own fallibility, and the realization that even with the best intentions, we can still make mistakes. The memory of that moment continues to trouble me, a nagging sense of regret that I may never be able to shake. Despite this, I am trying to learn from my experiences, to use them as a catalyst for growth and self-improvement. The journey ahead will undoubtedly be challenging, but I am determined to face it head-on, armed with the knowledge that I can always strive to do better, to be better."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.","for someone to have survived the treacherous journey across the scorching desert with minimal supplies, and",39,"for someone to have survived the treacherous journey across the scorching desert with minimal supplies, and I found myself entangled in a web of explanations, trying to make sense of the impossible, while Graham's inquisitive eyes seemed to bore into my very soul, as if searching for a hidden truth that only I could provide, and the more I spoke, the more I realized that the tale was not just about survival, but about the unyielding human spirit that drives individuals to push beyond the boundaries of what is thought to be possible, to challenge the status quo, and to emerge victorious against all odds, and it was this very essence that Graham was trying to grasp, to understand the underlying forces that had propelled the traveler forward, even when all hope seemed lost, and I could see the wheels turning in his mind, as he pieced together the fragments of the story, trying to recreate the journey in his own imagination, and I knew that I had to be careful, for the line between reality and myth was thinning, and the truth was beginning to unravel, like the threads of a tapestry, slowly revealing a picture that was both fascinating and unsettling, a picture that would change our understanding of human endurance forever."
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.","his lips, the smoke curling lazily upwards as he stared intently at a piece of paper in front of him.

I dropped my bag on the floor and walked over to Graham, peering over his shoulder to see what had captured his attention so thoroughly. It was a map, spread out across the table, with various symbols and markings scribbled across its surface. Graham looked up at me, his eyes sparkling with excitement, and I could tell that he had been planning something. ""Hey, I've been thinking,"" he said, his voice low and conspiratorial, ""we should take a trip, just the two of us. Somewhere we've never been before."" My heart skipped a beat as I considered the possibilities, and I felt a thrill of adventure wash over me. ""Where did you have in mind?"" I asked, my curiosity piqued, and Graham's grin only grew wider as he began to explain his plan."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers. He took in anecdotes about my childhood meals as if they would contribute to a portrait of a whole woman. He ignored the fact that mostly I cooked assorted chicken pieces on rice. I could tell him things about galangal, and he found that very profound.","and gears that made up the intricate mechanisms of the machinery he worked with.

As we sat at the small kitchen table, the scent of sizzling onions and garlic filled the air, transporting me back to my childhood. Graham's eyes would light up with excitement as I described the various dishes my mother used to make, from the spicy tom yum soup to the fragrant nasi lemak. He was particularly fascinated by the combination of flavors and textures that defined Southeast Asian cuisine, and I enjoyed watching him try to replicate the dishes in his own kitchen. The sound of sizzling and simmering filled the air, accompanied by the occasional clinking of pots and pans, as Graham experimented with new recipes. His passion for cooking was infectious, and soon I found myself joining him in the kitchen, sharing stories and laughter as we cooked up a storm. The kitchen became a space where we could bond over our shared love of food, and I began to see Graham in a new light, as a kindred spirit who appreciated the beauty of a well-crafted meal. As the days turned into weeks, our culinary adventures became a staple of our relationship, a way for us to connect and create memories that would last a lifetime."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization. I wanted him in a role that didn’t require him to be at sea for months, possibly years,","at a time. It was too soon, I told myself.

As he delved deeper into his work, he began to reconnect with his past, sharing stories of his time at sea with visitors and colleagues alike. I watched him come alive in his new role, and our relationship blossomed as we navigated this new chapter together. We started to make friends with his coworkers and their families, forming a community that understood and appreciated the sacrifices we had made as a military family. Our social circle expanded, and we found ourselves attending museum events, sailing regattas, and other gatherings that celebrated the maritime heritage of our adopted city. As the months passed, we grew more confident in our decision to leave the navy behind and start anew, and we began to see the possibilities that this new life had to offer. We started to make long-term plans, discussing everything from buying a home to starting a family, and our future began to take shape in ways we never thought possible. The bridge year had been a challenging but necessary step in our journey, and now we were finally starting to see the fruits of our labor, building a life that was filled with purpose, love, and a sense of belonging."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.","The soulful voice of John Lennon filled the room, a stark contrast to the tense atmosphere that had settled over the group.

The others, however, couldn't help but be drawn in by the haunting melody, their minds wandering to the memories and emotions that the song evoked. It was as if the music had become a catalyst, stirring up feelings and thoughts that had been simmering just below the surface. As the song reached its climax, the room seemed to hold its collective breath, the only sound the poignant lyrics and the soft hum of the laptop. And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the music stopped, leaving behind an awkward silence that seemed to hang in the air like a challenge."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes.

"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades.

The water was rising fast, and I knew I had to act quickly to secure my own home. I rushed to gather sandbags and began to build a wall around my front door, the cold water seeping into my bones as I worked. As the night wore on, the rain showed no signs of letting up, and the river that was once our street continued to rise, threatening to engulf everything in its path.

And yet, even in the midst of all this destruction, there was a sense of camaraderie that had developed among the residents, a sense of shared purpose that drove us to keep going, to keep fighting against the forces of nature that seemed determined to destroy our homes and our lives."

The weight of their collaboration hung in the balance, and any misstep could jeopardize the delicate dance of power and information they had so carefully choreographed. Eighteen-forty-seven, a codename that had become synonymous with a complex web of alliances and rivalries, represented a crucial piece in the puzzle they were trying to solve, and Adela's assertion underscored the importance of maintaining a strong, unified front in the face of uncertainty. As the team leader, she knew that fostering trust and cooperation was key to unlocking the secrets that lay hidden, and she was determined to see their mission through to its conclusion, no matter the cost or the challenges that lay ahead."
"Adela’s voice contracted on that last sentence. She wiped her gaze, concentrated in her one working eye, up and down my face, to see if I’d noticed, and continued, “Our first priority","is protecting the expats and the time-door. The time-door has been moved to a secure location. I suggest you retake the physical aptitude assessment, and then we can work on your lateral-reasoning scores—”","is to ensure your safety, and I must inform you that we have reason to believe your presence here has not gone unnoticed.

I've arranged for a secure escort to accompany you to a safe house, where we can further discuss the details of your circumstances and the necessary precautions to be taken. In the meantime, I advise you to remain vigilant and avoid engaging with anyone who may approach you with suspicious intentions. Your well-being is our utmost concern, and we will do everything in our power to guarantee your security. As we proceed, I must emphasize the importance of discretion and trust; the fewer people who know about your whereabouts, the better. Can I trust that you will cooperate fully with our efforts to keep you safe?"
"Arthur was gentle, no matter how grotty my behavior. He had found out about Scrabble, and he sometimes brought",his travel set along—my inner competitive bitch could stave off a black mood for half an hour or so.,"his own board to our sessions, carefully selecting words that would be easy for me to understand and",38,"his own board to our sessions, carefully selecting words that would be easy for me to understand and play along with, which made the experience even more enjoyable and helped me to improve my vocabulary at a steady pace. As time went by, our Scrabble games became a staple of our interactions, and I found myself looking forward to them with great anticipation, not just because of the game itself, but also because of the quality time we spent together, chatting and laughing as we competed in a friendly and supportive environment. Arthur's patience and kindness were traits that I admired greatly, and I felt grateful to have him in my life, teaching me valuable lessons that extended far beyond the confines of a simple board game."
"My email made a chiding noise. Adela was the originator, and she’d put me in blind copy.",It was a short email. Adela had a real gift for cramming apoplexy into a couple of lines.,"Her message was brief, but the words danced on the screen with an air of urgency, requesting",35,"Her message was brief, but the words danced on the screen with an air of urgency, requesting a meeting at the old café on the outskirts of town, a place we hadn't visited in years. The subject line read ""We need to talk,"" and the lack of any additional context only served to heighten my curiosity. I found myself wondering what could be so important that Adela felt the need to reach out after such a long period of silence, and why she had chosen to blind copy me, as if she wanted to keep our communication private from the other recipients. The more I thought about it, the more my mind swirled with possibilities, each one more intriguing than the last. With a sense of anticipation building in my chest, I typed out a response, agreeing to meet her at the specified time, and then I hit send, the sound of the email leaving my outbox echoing through the stillness of my room like a promise of things to come."
The email told us that her death would be reported to the expats as,"a suicide. “This cannot be emphasized enough,” Adela had written, with a double underline.","a tragic accident, and that the embassy would provide counseling services to those who were",28,"a tragic accident, and that the embassy would provide counseling services to those who were close to her, while also ensuring that her family back home was informed and supported throughout the process, and that all necessary arrangements would be made to repatriate her remains, if that was the wish of her loved ones, and the local authorities would be cooperating fully with the investigation to determine the exact circumstances surrounding her untimely passing, which had sent shockwaves through the tight-knit expat community, where she was known for her vibrant personality and her love of exploring new places and experiencing different cultures."
"Arthur smiled and sat down beside me, stretching out his long legs. Twisting the signet ring on his finger—a tell as","clarion as my skin biting—he murmured, “We didn’t know her as well as we would have liked.

The air around us seemed to thicken, heavy with unspoken emotions and unresolved tensions, as he delved into the subject that had been weighing on his mind for what felt like an eternity. His eyes, a deep, piercing brown that seemed to see right through me, locked onto mine, and I felt a shiver run down my spine as he started to reveal the secrets he had been keeping hidden for so long. The world around us melted away, leaving only the two of us, suspended in a sea of uncertainty, as the truth began to unravel like a thread pulled from a delicate tapestry."
"Anne Spencer almost made it off those wards. After I read the email, an ancient and exuberant terror blazed through me. It was partly the terror that had grown in me alongside my very bones,","knowing as I did that I only existed because my mother had outrun almost; I don’t know at what point you stop feeling the need to run, generation by generation, when you’re born after that.","as I recalled the countless nights spent listening to her stories, the way her eyes would light up when speaking of her time on those wards, and the unspoken understanding that some experiences",70,"as I recalled the countless nights spent listening to her stories, the way her eyes would light up when speaking of her time on those wards, and the unspoken understanding that some experiences leave an indelible mark on one's soul. The email had awakened a deep-seated fear, one that I had tried to keep at bay, but it now threatened to consume me. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being pulled back into a world I thought I had long left behind, a world where the lines between reality and nightmare were constantly blurred. As I sat there, frozen in a mix of dread and nostalgia, I knew I had to confront the demons that had haunted me for so long, to face the darkness head-on and find a way to reclaim the pieces of myself that I had lost in those wards. The question was, where would I even begin, and would I be able to overcome the terror that had taken hold of me, or would it ultimately prove to be my undoing?"
"He was sitting at the noisome kitchen table, staring at nothing. Rogue Male was lying splayed and face down by the ashtray. The thing in my chest kicked again","as I realized he must have grabbed it as we left our home.

The air in the room seemed to thicken, heavy with an unspoken tension that hung like a challenge, waiting to be acknowledged. I glanced around the kitchen, taking in the familiar sights of worn linoleum and faded curtains, but everything seemed off, like a painting with a single brushstroke out of place. The silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the sound of my own ragged breathing and the creaks and groans of the old house settling into its foundations. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I turned my attention back to the figure slumped at the table, the stillness of his body a stark contrast to the turmoil brewing inside me. Suddenly, the thing in my chest gave a particularly violent lurch, and I knew I had to move, to do something, anything, to break the spell that had been cast over us. But as I pushed back my chair and stood up, my legs felt like lead, heavy and unresponsive, as if rooted to the spot. And then, just as I was starting to think that I was trapped, frozen in a living nightmare, I heard a faint noise, a low rustling sound that seemed to be coming from outside the kitchen window."
