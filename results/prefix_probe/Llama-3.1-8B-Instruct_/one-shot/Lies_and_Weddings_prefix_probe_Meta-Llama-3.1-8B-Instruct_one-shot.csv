I tried calling her, but she's not answering, and I'm starting to get a little worried. Has something happened, or is she just avoiding me?

“Why? Are you going to the Wolseley?

Rufus gestured outside. On one end of the back deck was an outdoor shower nestled between thick tropical bushes and a,wall of stacked volcanic rocks.

"No sooner had Rufus said this than a now-familiar roar filled the air and Freddy’s fantastical boat pulled up to the dock.

His words hung in the air like a challenge, and the group fell silent, their eyes fixed on him with a mix of curiosity and trepidation, as they wondered what lay ahead."

And when her mother finally walked through the door, a smile on her face and a bag of groceries in her arms, Eden would feel a wave of relief wash over her, followed by a deep sense of guilt for having worried so much.
