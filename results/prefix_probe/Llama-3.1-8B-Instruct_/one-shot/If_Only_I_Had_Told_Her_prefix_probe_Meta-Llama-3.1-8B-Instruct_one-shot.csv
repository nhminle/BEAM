I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that,"we were crashing at my house, and I felt it was my duty to be the one to take the blows.","he had been drinking heavily, and I didn't want him to say or do anything that might jeopardize",41,"he had been drinking heavily, and I didn't want him to say or do anything that might jeopardize our chances of getting the job, which was already looking increasingly uncertain due to the tight deadline and the fact that our main competitor had somehow managed to secure a meeting with the client."
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.","we were still trying to process the eerie atmosphere and the jump scares that left us all on the edge of our seats, but little did we",49,"we were still trying to process the eerie atmosphere and the jump scares that left us all on the edge of our seats, but little did we know that the real horror was only just beginning, as strange things started to happen around us, and it wasn't until we received that mysterious package in the mail that we realized our nightmare was far from over."
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.","for the moment, the softness of the blankets and the darkness behind my eyelids help to calm",36,"for the moment, the softness of the blankets and the darkness behind my eyelids help to calm my racing thoughts, but I know it's only a temporary reprieve from the awkwardness that has settled in the air, and I can sense Jack's presence still, his eyes fixed on me with a mix of concern and curiosity, wondering what I'm thinking, what I'm feeling, and whether I'm okay with what just happened."
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,"to speak in a hushed tone, his eyes darting toward the entrance of the tent, where a faint light flickers, casting",41,"to speak in a hushed tone, his eyes darting toward the entrance of the tent, where a faint light flickers, casting eerie shadows on the surrounding trees, and the sound of muffled voices carries on the wind, making it difficult to discern what's being said, but the concern etched on his face is unmistakable, and I can sense the unspoken question hanging in the air, a question that I'm not sure I'm ready to answer, but one that seems to be burning a hole in his mind, and in mine, as we stand there, frozen in uncertainty, the only sound being the distant howling of wolves, a haunting reminder of the vast and unforgiving wilderness that surrounds us."
"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with","the word “type.” Autumn makes a noise in the tent, and we both hold our breaths and listen.","in a muffled tone, and then he looks up at me with a mixture of frustration and desperation",35,"in a muffled tone, and then he looks up at me with a mixture of frustration and desperation in his eyes, his gaze searching for something, or someone, to cling to in this moment of turmoil."

"I walk Jack to his car, and when he turns to me with that","look on his face, I know what he’s going to say. I open my mouth.","smile, I feel a flutter in my chest, a mix of emotions swirling together",29,"smile, I feel a flutter in my chest, a mix of emotions swirling together like the autumn leaves that crunch beneath our feet as we stand in the fading light of day, the sound of the crickets providing a soothing background melody."
"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke. Surely the school administrators knew we had always been together, were meant to be together. Surely, if I looked around the cafeteria, she would be there?","together was a small price to pay for the freedom to roam the empty hallways and explore the school's hidden corners, a luxury I cherished as I navigated the unfamiliar corridors, trying",61,"together was a small price to pay for the freedom to roam the empty hallways and explore the school's hidden corners, a luxury I cherished as I navigated the unfamiliar corridors, trying to make sense of the labyrinthine layout and the cacophony of unfamiliar faces, while Jack, on the other hand, seemed to know exactly where he was going, his confident stride and easy smile drawing the attention of several girls, including a blonde-haired girl with a bright smile, who caught my eye as she laughed at something Jack said, and I felt a pang of curiosity about this new friend of mine, wondering what it was about him that made him so magnetic, and whether I would ever be able to measure up to his effortless charm."
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time. I didn’t sit down because I recognized Jack though; I simply sat at the first empty seat, defeated. But Jack remembered me. He asked me if I ever watched pro soccer. I said yeah, not really interested in conversation, not really listening, wondering what Autumn was doing.","dismissed us, and I had been looking forward to this chance to catch up with him all day.

He smiled and leaned back in his chair, his eyes scanning the dimly lit café as if searching for something or someone, before focusing back on me with a friendly grin. The waitress came over to take our order, and Jack suggested we grab a couple of burgers and fries, which I agreed to, and we spent the next few minutes chatting about our favorite sports teams and the upcoming school year. As we waited for our food to arrive, Jack asked me about my summer break, and I told him about my family's road trip to the beach, which he listened to intently, asking follow-up questions and making me laugh with his witty remarks. The atmosphere in the café was relaxed and casual, and I felt at ease with Jack, like we had known each other for years, not just a few months. Our food arrived, and we dug in, savoring the taste of the juicy burgers and crispy fries, and continuing our conversation about everything and nothing, enjoying each other's company in the warm and cozy café."
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.","stared at her with a mixture of surprise and curiosity, taking in the changes that time and distance had brought about, his eyes lingering on the gentle curves of her cheeks and the way her hair cascaded down her back like a rich, autumnal waterfall, and for a",92,"stared at her with a mixture of surprise and curiosity, taking in the changes that time and distance had brought about, his eyes lingering on the gentle curves of her cheeks and the way her hair cascaded down her back like a rich, autumnal waterfall, and for a moment, they just stood there, the air thick with unspoken words and unresolved emotions, until finally, he broke the silence with a hesitant smile, and Autumn's face softened, a hint of a smile playing on her lips as she replied, ""Hi,"" in a voice that was both familiar and yet, somehow, utterly new."
"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face. He didn’t believe that Autumn was—or ever had been—my friend. The daughter of my mom’s best friend, who was around a lot? Sure. But he thought I had deluded myself into believing this hot girl was my friend.","his face, a mixture of sadness and concern that made me feel a pang in my chest.

The silence that followed was oppressive, and I couldn't help but wonder what he was thinking as he stood there, his eyes fixed on mine before he finally turned and walked away, leaving me to process the strange and unsettling encounter."
"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.","of the season's vibrant colors adorned the walls, and the scent of pumpkin spice wafted through the air, creating a cozy atmosphere that Jack couldn't help",58,"of the season's vibrant colors adorned the walls, and the scent of pumpkin spice wafted through the air, creating a cozy atmosphere that Jack couldn't help but be drawn to. As the days went by, Jack found himself growing more and more fond of the season, and I was thrilled to see my mission succeeding. The crisp air and the smell of fallen leaves only added to the charm, and soon Jack was joining me on long walks through the woods, taking in the beauty of nature as the trees donned their golden hues. I had never seen him so carefree, and it was all thanks to Autumn's gentle grasp on our lives."
"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still","friends. On the last day of school before winter break, Jack finally said something. I cannot remember what I had been telling him, only that it had been about Autumn.","in a relationship, or that our friendship had ever transcended the boundaries of a simple acquaintance, a notion that seemed increasingly difficult to reconcile with the",59,"still in a relationship, or that our friendship had ever transcended the boundaries of a simple acquaintance, a notion that seemed increasingly difficult to reconcile with the evidence of our past interactions, which now seemed to suggest a more complicated web of emotions and unspoken understandings that neither of us was willing to acknowledge, at least not yet."
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah? Let’s take this outside,” and hurried me out.","to see a hint of fear, but instead, I saw a mix of determination and a dash of desperation, as if he was trying to muster",41,"to see a hint of fear, but instead, I saw a mix of determination and a dash of desperation, as if he was trying to muster up the courage to tell me something that had been weighing heavily on his mind."
"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind","yourself, ‘Autumn is where she wants to be right now, and that’s okay. I’m still great, and I’ll be around if she needs me.’ Hmm?” She squeezed my foot again.","your parents that you're trying, and that you're proud of yourself for being brave and trying new things.

You can also think about all the things you're good at, like riding a bike or drawing. And don't forget, it's okay to make mistakes – that's how we learn and grow. You're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Your parents love you no matter what, and they want you to be happy and successful. So, let's take a deep breath and focus on the good things in your life, and remember that you're strong and capable of overcoming any challenge that comes your way."
"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly. I’d show Autumn that I wasn’t a loser without friends; Jack and I would make more friends somehow.,"wasn't as physically demanding as I had initially thought, but the mental aspect was where I needed to improve, and that's exactly what I was trying",53,"wasn't as physically demanding as I had initially thought, but the mental aspect was where I needed to improve, and that's exactly what I was trying to do by joining a summer training program to work on my endurance and agility, which would not only help me in soccer but also in other areas of my life, such as school and personal relationships."
"Jack and I had worried one of us might not make it on the junior varsity team. When the lists were posted,","I searched for my name on the JV list and was devastated to not see it. Still, I was happy for Jack.","it turned out that I had made it, but Jack had not, and he was visibly disappointed, his face a mix of",44,"it turned out that I had made it, but Jack had not, and he was visibly disappointed, his face a mix of sadness and frustration as he walked away from the bulletin board, his eyes scanning the list for what felt like an eternity, trying to process the news, and I felt a pang of sympathy for my friend, knowing how much he had been looking forward to being on the team, and I decided to approach him, to offer some words of encouragement, but before I could say anything, he had already turned the corner and disappeared from view, leaving me to wonder if I should have said something, or if it was better to let him process his emotions in private, and as I stood there, I couldn't help but think about the long hours we had spent practicing together, the countless shots we had taken, and the endless drills we had run, all in preparation for this moment, and now it seemed like it had all been for nothing, at least for Jack, and I felt a sense of regret wash over me, wondering if there was anything I could have done differently, anything I could have done to help him make the team, and as I stood there, lost in thought, I heard the sound of the coach calling out to me, asking me to come over to the field for a meeting, and I knew that I had to put my own disappointment aside, at least for now, and focus on the task at hand, but my mind kept wandering back to Jack, and the what-ifs that lingered in my head, and I couldn't shake the feeling that this was only the beginning of a difficult season, one that would test our friendship, our determination, and our resolve, and I steeled myself for the challenges ahead, knowing that I had to be there for Jack, no matter what."
"Jack told me later that my ability to brush off the snarky comment from that junior, my new teammate,",made me seem cool. There had been chuckles of appreciation according to him.

"The varsity soccer team practiced on the north field, near the student parking lots. The junior varsity team practiced on the south field, closer to the circular drive where parents dropped off and picked","up kids. Even though Jack and I were on different teams, our schedules were still the same, and my mom would drive us to and from practice every day for those last weeks of summer.","up their children after school.

"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me.

She listened attentively and offered some words of encouragement, reminding me that I had been practicing hard and was ready for the challenge ahead."
"We all joined Jack on the low wall, waiting to get picked up. We didn’t talk that much, but the next day, as I trudged from the north field to","the south, I saw the girls by the gym door again.

The sun was shining brightly overhead, casting long shadows across the fields, and a gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the trees as I walked, the silence broken only by the sound of my boots crunching on the gravel path. I had always known Jack as a bit of a troublemaker, but what had happened the day before had shown me a different side of him, one that was both captivating and unsettling. As I approached the farmhouse, I could see the others waiting for me, their faces a mixture of excitement and apprehension, and I knew that our lives were about to change in ways we could hardly imagine."
"What if, this morning, she woke up in the tent before I thought?

"It strikes me how backward my plan sounds: give up a girl who adores me, who I love well enough, to be a disciple for a different girl who will","never fall for me. Jack has always said I’m irrational when it comes to Autumn, and maybe I should have taken him more seriously, because he was right earlier today.","not even acknowledge my existence, let alone return the same affection, and risk losing the one person who truly understands me, who has been by my side through thick",60,"not even acknowledge my existence, let alone return the same affection, and risk losing the one person who truly understands me, who has been by my side through thick and thin, and who has a heart that beats in harmony with mine, yet I am drawn to the thrill of the unknown, the promise of a new connection, and the possibility of a love that could change my life forever, a love that may be worth the risk of losing the one I already have, a love that may be worth the uncertainty and the heartache that comes with it."
“I already know why you did it.” She doesn’t have to explain that part. I know she’s never wanted me like that. I don’t need to hear her,say it. “I just want to know why you had to be so cruel about it.” It’s time to face what Jack has been telling me all these years.,"the reasons behind her reluctance, though it's a truth that cuts deep within me, a painful reminder of the unrequited love I've harbored",57,"the reasons behind her reluctance, though it's a truth that cuts deep within me, a painful reminder of the unrequited love I've harbored for her for so long.

But Autumn’s getting upset. She sits up and pulls the covers,around her protectively. She frowns at me. The birds are still singing.,"off her shoulders, her eyes fixed on the window where the first snowflakes",23,"off her shoulders, her eyes fixed on the window where the first snowflakes are gently falling, casting a serene silence over the room."

“I don’t like him.” I shrugged. “I told you before: Autumn’s an old friend from when we were kids. Sucks that she,"likes such a show-off.” I shrugged again.

She's actually one of the most genuine people I've ever met, and I feel lucky to have her in my life. I'm not sure what's going on, but I think you should give her a chance to explain herself before jumping to conclusions."
My face must change because she smiles and clambers into my lap. We wrap our arms around each other and settle in.,"After a moment, she says, “You know, I never thought this would happen either.

"“Sorry,” I say. “I was trying to decide whether I should kill Jack for telling you I was",into you or if I should kill him for telling you that I wasn’t into you.

"“Yeah,” I admit. Jack was protecting me, but there’s no way he believed that I was over Autumn.

He takes another sip, the liquid sliding down his throat, and continues, his voice low and measured, ""It was as if she was trying to shield us from the truth, to protect us from the reality of his presence in our lives. But I think she was also trying to shield him, to keep him at arm's length, to prevent him from getting too close, from getting too comfortable. She was a complex woman, full of contradictions, and I'm not sure I ever truly understood her."" He sets his glass down, his eyes drifting towards the window, where the city lights twinkle like diamonds against the dark sky, and he continues, his voice barely above a whisper, ""I think that's what I'm trying to say, that she was a woman of many layers, and I'm not sure I ever peeled back enough of them to truly know her."" The silence that follows is oppressive, heavy with unspoken words and unresolved emotions, and he breaks it with a quiet sigh, the sound barely audible over the hum of the air conditioning in the background."
"The waitress appears with our salads. Mine is seaweed and shavings of cucumber, which looks like a pile of green spaghetti. John’s salad is red somehow. I find myself ordering both steak and lobster and wondering if the waitress will","faint if I ask for a doggy bag at the end of the meal. Before she leaves, she asks John if he would like another martini. He hesitates and says no but to ask again after the entrées have arrived.","smile and tell me that it's not a problem, that they can accommodate my indecisiveness, but I'm not so sure, and I glance over at John, who's watching me with a mixture of amusement and concern, his",80,"smile and tell me that it's not a problem, that they can accommodate my indecisiveness, but I'm not so sure, and I glance over at John, who's watching me with a mixture of amusement and concern, his eyes crinkled at the corners, and I feel a flutter in my chest, which I quickly attribute to the caffeine from the coffee I had earlier, but deep down, I know it's something more, and I try to focus on the menu, but my mind keeps wandering back to the way John's eyes crinkle when he smiles, and I wonder if he's the kind of person who likes surprises, and if he'd be surprised if I ordered the lobster, and if he'd be disappointed if I didn't, and I feel a sense of trepidation wash over me, as I realize that I'm not just ordering a meal, I'm making a decision that could potentially change the course of our evening, and maybe even our relationship, and I take a deep breath and try to calm myself down, but my heart is racing, and I can feel my palms growing sweaty, and I know I need to make a decision, and fast, before the waitress comes back to take our order, and I glance over at John again, and this time, I catch his eye, and he raises an eyebrow, and I feel a spark of electricity run through my body, and I know I'm in trouble, because I think I might be falling for him, and I'm not sure if I'm ready for that, but I'm not sure I can help it either."
