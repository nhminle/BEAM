"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking. Lacerations too, from a Taser—he’d shot at two of the team members who’d come to expatriate him, and a third was forced to fire.","their bodies had been returned to the twenty-first century, leaving the remaining five to navigate this bewildering new world, where the most mundane tasks required an understanding of technology that was beyond their wildest comprehension.

Graham's own memories of the extraction process were hazy, but he recalled the sensation of being pulled apart and put back together again, the feeling of his consciousness being stretched to its limits as he was propelled through time and space. It was a miracle that he had made it, and he knew that he was one of the lucky ones. The others, however, were not so fortunate, and their loss weighed heavily on his mind as he struggled to come to terms with his new surroundings. The hospital room was a sterile, antiseptic environment, filled with beeping machines and sterile white walls that seemed to close in on him like a prison. He felt a sense of claustrophobia wash over him as he lay in bed, his mind racing with questions about this strange new world and his place in it. The doctor, a kind-faced woman with a warm smile, entered the room and began to explain the next steps in his recovery, but Graham's attention wandered as he gazed out the window, watching the people below going about their daily lives with a sense of detachment, as if they were living in a different world altogether."
"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into","his eighties. As it was, he was thirty-seven years old and had not experienced crinolines, A Tale of Two Cities, or the enfranchisement of the working classes.","the 20th century, but it had been converted into a small office space in the 1960s, with a cramped, fluorescent-lit interior that seemed to suck the last vestiges",53,"the 20th century, but it had been converted into a small office space in the 1960s, with a cramped, fluorescent-lit interior that seemed to suck the last vestiges of warmth from the air.

"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale.

"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer. I’m sure he knew plenty about ship’s rigging, but he’d probably never handled an instrument more technologically complex than a sextant.

However, Gore's fascination with the mysterious device had been piqued, and he found himself pouring over dusty tomes in the ship's library, devouring information on the intricacies of clockwork mechanisms and the principles of thermodynamics. His crewmates, a rough bunch of sailors and soldiers, looked on in confusion as Gore spent hours tinkering with the device, muttering to himself about ""calibrations"" and ""resonance."" They had no idea what he was working towards, but they knew it couldn't be good, and they kept a safe distance, whispering among themselves about the officer's ""madness."" Little did they know, Gore's tinkering would soon lead to a breakthrough that would change the course of history, and the world would never be the same again."
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people. Hunting was out of the question, and socializing was limited by order of the Ministry. By the end of the first week he was visibly going bonkers with no one but me to talk to.","reading, and his love for literature was evident in the way he spoke about the works of Shakespeare and Austen, often quoting lines from memory with a charming smile.

His passion for music was contagious, and I found myself drawn to the sound of the flute, which he would play with such elegance and poise. Despite his many talents, Gore was humble and kind, with a quick wit and a sharp mind that made him a joy to be around. He had a way of making everyone feel seen and heard, and his presence was a balm to those around him. As I got to know him better, I began to realize that Gore's many talents were not just a product of his natural gifts, but also of his dedication and hard work. He was a true Renaissance man, and I felt grateful to have him in my life."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea. He told me stories as if he were trying to catch himself in amber. Just like my mother, though I didn’t tell him that.","the comings and goings of sailors, the smell of saltwater and tar, the cries of gulls overhead, and the endless expanse of the ocean stretching out before him.

He must have felt the thrill of adventure, the rush of the unknown, and the sense of possibility that came with every new port of call. And yet, as he stood on the deck of this modern world, he saw only a reflection of the past, a world that was both familiar and yet utterly foreign. He saw the steel and concrete skyscrapers that pierced the sky like giant metal spires, the hum of traffic and the chatter of people rushing to and fro, and the endless stream of information that flowed through the air like a never-ending river. It was a world that was both wondrous and overwhelming, a world that was both a marvel and a nightmare. And Gore, with his old-fashioned sensibilities and his romantic notions of a bygone era, was both fascinated and appalled by it all."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake. Another person’s unguardedness in that moment can be very useful, interpersonally, as long as you don’t soften. There is language I could use about this if I were the melodramatic type: behind enemy lines, for example, or double agent. My sister might use these terms, or she might call me a fraud.","it turned out, he was not as surprised as I had anticipated, I couldn't help but wonder if he had somehow already suspected it.

Instead, I changed the subject, hoping to steer the conversation in a different direction. But the seed of doubt had been planted, and I couldn't shake the feeling that he knew more than he was letting on. As we continued to talk, I found myself glancing at him occasionally, searching for any sign of deception or confirmation, but his face remained a mask of calm, collected composure. I began to feel a sense of unease, wondering if I had been foolish to think I could keep my secret hidden for so long. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I had been living a lie, and the weight of that realization was starting to bear down on me."

So is the blood, but it seems melodramatic to observe this.","through his skin, a constant reminder of the wound that refuses to heal, a physical",28,"through his skin, a constant reminder of the wound that refuses to heal, a physical manifestation of the emotional turmoil that has been festering within him for what feels like an eternity, a wound that seems to be slowly poisoning his very soul."
The ice outside shifts—the Arctic stammering its jaws as a cat does when it sees a bird. The ship’s cat died in convulsions during,"their second winter. Gore had liked that cat. He’d become quite attached to it, especially as his dog had died in the first spring.","The night before, and the crew had been on edge ever since, whispering among themselves about curses and omens.

The captain's usually steady hand had been shaking as he navigated through the treacherous waters, and the first mate's eyes had taken on a haunted look, as if he was seeing something that no one else could. The wind howled through the rigging like a chorus of restless spirits, and the ship creaked and groaned in response, its wooden hull protesting the strain. The crew's anxiety was palpable, and even the seasoned sailors were on edge, their usual banter and jokes replaced by nervous glances and hushed conversations. As the ice continued to shift and the ship struggled to stay on course, it seemed as though the very fabric of reality was unraveling, and the crew was powerless to stop it."
"Once we arrived at the Ministry, an escort of subtly armed suits took Gore to meet the other expats. I was expecting he’d","go through a group therapy session, but Gore was in a sunny mood, so he must have been envisaging something closer to a salon.","be greeted with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion, but instead, they welcomed him with a blend of warmth and familiarity, as",47,"be greeted with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion, but instead, they welcomed him with a blend of warmth and familiarity, as if they had known him for years, and the leader of the group, a tall, imposing figure with a stern expression, extended a firm handshake and said, ""Ah, Gore, we've been expecting you, we have a lot to discuss regarding the recent developments in the sector, and we believe your unique skills will be invaluable to our mission."" The group's demeanor was a stark contrast to the cold, sterile atmosphere of the Ministry's corridors, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as I watched Gore's expression shift from caution to intrigue, as he was led deeper into the heart of the Ministry, further and further away from the world outside."
"“Complex,” said Adela. “Thanks for your input. Given their histories, mental trauma is to be anticipated.

By doing so, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between mental trauma and human behavior."
"“We can’t risk the temporal repercussions,” said Adela. “They are supposed to be dead. As long as they’re here, it’s functionally as if they are dead in","their own time.

"We’d arrived in the central lobby. Gore was standing in a shaft of sunlight, staring up",at the steel-and-glass ceiling.

"We went for lunch at a small bistro near the Ministry. Gore came from an era of service à la française, private dining rooms and putting everything into jelly. When I began to","explain, in tones of motherly patience, how twenty-first-century restaurants operated, he said, “I’ve eaten kangaroo on the uninhabited shores of the Albert River.

The intricately set tables, the crisp linens, and the impeccable service all transported me to a bygone era, one that seemed to be a world away from the fast-paced, modern world I was accustomed to. As I perused the menu, I noticed that the dishes were all named after famous French artists, and I couldn't help but wonder if Gore's love for art extended beyond his passion for food. The waiter, noticing my curiosity, leaned in and whispered that Gore had indeed been a patron of the arts, and that his love for French culture was only rivalled by his love for his family."
"“I thought it might be a good thing to make a proper friend of him,” Gore continued. “He said he would arrange for his bridge to",take us to”—here he raised his eyebrows—“a public house.

"Back at the house I was still struggling to think of as “home,” Gore shyly asked me if I would also “come for a drink.” He had done well, at lunch, to hide his deep embarrassment over my payment",of the bill (with a Ministry expense card); he was adjusting with gold-star alacrity in recognizing that it wouldn’t be a reputation-detonating act for a respectable woman to be seen in a public house in the company of bachelors.,"of the bill, but now, as we stood in the dimly lit hallway, he seemed to be wrestling with a more profound sense of unease, one that had little to do with the awkwardness of the earlier moment and everything to do with the unspoken",78,"of the bill, but now, as we stood in the dimly lit hallway, he seemed to be wrestling with a more profound sense of unease, one that had little to do with the awkwardness of the earlier moment and everything to do with the unspoken understanding that our relationship had crossed a threshold, one that neither of us was quite sure how to navigate. The air was thick with tension as we stood there, the silence between us a palpable thing, and I couldn't help but wonder if I had misread the situation entirely, if my interpretation of his invitation was somehow skewed by my own desires and expectations. I looked at him, searching for some sign, some hint of what he was thinking, but his face was a mask, a carefully crafted expression that gave away nothing. And yet, despite the uncertainty that swirled around us, I felt a spark of excitement, a sense that this was the moment we had been building towards, the moment when the boundaries between us would be tested and perhaps, just perhaps, we would find a new way of being together."

I thought it was a form of juvenilia, drawn in","his earliest years as a modern man, something to remind him of on a significant anniversary of his arrival here; and not, as it would turn out to be, a red letter from another era.","the margins of a notebook, a doodle scribbled during a lecture on ancient civilizations, but the more I looked at it, the more I became convinced that it was something more.",70,"the margins of a notebook, a doodle scribbled during a lecture on ancient civilizations, but the more I looked at it, the more I became convinced that it was something more."
"By the start of that summer, Graham was practically a native of the era. He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle. Most mornings he rose—hours before me—and",went for a run. He would sometimes wake me up with a juicy smoker’s wheeze on his return to the house. He started giving me custody of his cigarettes and enforced a predinner smoking ban.,"made his way to the kitchen to brew a pot of coffee, the aroma of which would waft through the apartment and signal to me that he was up and about.

His daily routine was a comforting ritual, one that I had grown accustomed to over the months we'd spent together. He'd sit at the small table by the window, sipping his coffee and staring out at the city, lost in thought as the sun rose over the towering skyscrapers. I'd often join him, and we'd sit in silence for a while, watching the world wake up around us, before the sounds of the city grew loud enough to drown out our own quiet conversations."
"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past. I was prickly and defensive about","this; I could not look at why directly. I heard the way I spoke to him about it: adjustment, reasonable, citizen, responsibility, values. He blew a lot of pensive cigarette smoke at me.","my own heritage, but Graham's reaction was different, a mix of disdain and nostalgia that I couldn't quite understand.

He would often speak of the world before, of the music and the art, the literature and the people, with a wistfulness that made me feel like I was missing out on something essential. I tried to imagine what it must have been like, to live in a time before the internet, before smartphones, before the constant din of information that seemed to suffocate me. Graham's stories painted a picture of a world that was slower, more intimate, more human, and I found myself drawn to it, even as I struggled to reconcile it with the world I knew."
"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them. Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled","to focus on the tests—eyes moving rapidly. I once found him the sole occupant of the fifth-floor smoking area (a pigeon-shit-encrusted balcony), methodically shredding a filter of a finished cigarette. I watched him for a while, interested in the way that only his fingers moved. Most people ripple with surplus motion unless they are concentrating, but Graham only ever moved the parts of him that he wanted to move.","to maintain a steady gaze, while others fidgeted in their seats, their anxiety levels spiking as they were forced to confront the sterile environment that reminded them of the very places they had fled.

The researchers, however, were undeterred, and they decided to conduct the tests in a more neutral setting, one that would not evoke such strong emotional responses. They chose a small, nondescript room with a single table and two chairs, and the expats were brought in one by one to participate in the experiment. The tests themselves were designed to be as innocuous as possible, but the researchers were determined to push the expats to their limits, to see just how far they would go in order to avoid feeling empathy for the suffering of others. They began with simple scenarios, asking the expats to imagine themselves in the shoes of a person who was experiencing physical pain, and then gradually increased the complexity of the scenarios, adding emotional and psychological elements to the mix. The results were fascinating, and the researchers were eager to see how the expats would react to the most challenging scenarios of all, the ones that would require them to confront their own darkest fears and desires."
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too. Even Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had","fought in large-scale battles, were laid out by the ultramodern scope of the harm.

The debate raged on, with no clear solution in sight, as the team struggled to find a balance between scientific inquiry and the well-being of their subjects."
"Adela was always present at the honesty exams, often intervening in them. I got the impression that she was listening to offstage prompts that only she could","hear, being the only one among us who was aware she was on a stage, and was trying to chivvy us along the right course of action.","hear, her eyes darting towards the wings of the theater, where a mysterious figure in the shadows seemed to be guiding her every move,",54,"hear, her eyes darting towards the wings of the theater, where a mysterious figure in the shadows seemed to be guiding her every move, their whispers carried away by the rustling of the curtains, as if the very fate of the students hung in the balance, and Adela's role was not just that of a teacher, but a guardian of the truth, a sentinel of the stage, where the lines between reality and fiction blurred, and the stakes were higher than any grade or diploma."

"I went along to one of the earliest dinners, chicken bag slung over my shoulder.

"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it,","was a mystery.

"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had","just discovered that a woman with whom he was spending a lot of time would never be interested in him.

"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders. The bridges kept turning in their core reports, and the experiments kept running.

A small discrepancy in the data, a tiny anomaly that seemed to suggest that something was indeed happening. I felt a rush of adrenaline as I realized that we might be onto something after all. But as I delved deeper into the data, I began to realize that the anomaly was not what I had expected. It was not a sign of success, but rather a sign of something far more sinister."
"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events. He’d lain motionless in the garden for two hours, on","a wet and putrid night, to shoot a fox, and pulled out one of his own rotting teeth (he showed it to me afterward; it was the color of a tombstone, caped with gelatinous red)—was this Victorian, or was this “irregularities”?","his back, his eyes fixed on the sky, as if mesmerized by the clouds drifting lazily across the horizon.

As I savored the sweetness of the ice cream, I found myself lost in thought, replaying memories of our late-night conversations and laughter-filled adventures. The sound of children's chatter and the hum of the ice cream truck broke my reverie, and I looked up to see a group of kids staring at me with wide eyes, their faces smeared with colorful sprinkles. I smiled and offered them a friendly wave, feeling a sense of nostalgia wash over me as I realized that life had moved on, and I was no longer the carefree college student I once was. The thought sent a pang of melancholy through me, but it was quickly replaced by excitement at the prospect of reconnecting with Emily and seeing what the future held."

"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century. On ships there were cooks and officers’ stewards; at home, on the few occasions he was at home, there were women. Nevertheless, he had taken to cooking in a way he had failed to take to","television or texting or the use of deodorants (“I bathe every day,” he’d said to me with hurt dignity). Tonight, he hummed with a busyness that hardly shielded nervousness. He burned the onions and automatically reached for his cigarettes. I took them away—I didn’t want ashy Bolognese—and he accused me of “nanny-stating” him, a turn of phrase I found very alarming because I certainly hadn’t taught it to him. Where was he picking this stuff up?","anything else in his new life, finding solace in the simple, repetitive motions of chopping vegetables and stirring pots, a respite from the constant barrage of unfamiliar sights and sounds that bombarded him every waking moment.

The smell of sizzling onions and garlic wafting from the pan was a comforting familiarity, a reminder of the simple pleasures he had left behind. As he expertly flipped the eggs, his mind wandered back to the cramped, dimly lit galley of the HMS Dauntless, where he had spent countless hours watching the cooks prepare meals for the crew. He remembered the way the sizzle of the bacon had filled the air, the sound of the pots clanging against the metal countertops, and the smell of the sea mixed with the savory aromas of the food. It was a world away from the sterile, high-tech kitchen he now found himself in, but the sense of comfort and security it brought him was the same. He felt a sense of pride in being able to provide for himself, to take care of his own needs, and to create something nourishing and delicious from scratch. As he plated his breakfast, he couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment, a sense of belonging in this strange new world."
Margaret was wearing high-waisted cerulean bell-bottoms and a white blouse clocked with lace. She looked like a disco,"goddess, an astonishing concoction given that she was only barely older than the piano, never mind the synth.","star, her platform shoes gleaming under the flashing lights of the dance floor, as she twirled to the rhythm of",36,"star, her platform shoes gleaming under the flashing lights of the dance floor, as she twirled to the rhythm of the Bee Gees, her long hair swinging freely, a vision of 1970s glamour that seemed to transport everyone around her to a bygone era of carefree joy and unbridled self-expression."
"Arthur was happy and flushed. He was one of those unusual extroverts who have all the attributes of an introvert, save that they like being around other people. He had a gift for gentleness too, one of the rarest virtues in","any gender and especially in the kind of man Arthur was supposed to be.

His smile could light up a room, and his kind words had a way of soothing even the most troubled of souls.

It was a gift that not only brought joy to those around him but also made him a magnet for those seeking comfort and solace. His friends and family adored him for this quality, and he was often the first one they would turn to in times of need. Despite his outgoing nature, he was also a deep thinker, and his introspective side was a source of strength and wisdom that he drew upon when faced with life's challenges."

Found your forte?”","something that made me wonder if he was hiding a secret, or perhaps just enjoying",24,"something that made me wonder if he was hiding a secret, or perhaps just enjoying the mischievous thrill of teasing me."
"Arthur grimaced.

"Margaret, incidentally, listened to the men talk about their careers with a suffused urgency that only I noticed. In her own era, she’d slept in the room next to the one where she had been born.","She thought Scotland was far-flung and semi-barbaric. When we came round to talking about my time working as a translator in Cambodia, I felt her attention all over me.

The men's conversations about their professional triumphs and failures seemed to stir something within her, a sense of longing for a life she had never known, a life that was both familiar and foreign, like a half-remembered dream that refused to fade away. As she listened, her eyes would occasionally drift towards the old, worn-out photograph on her nightstand, a faded image of her mother, her eyes closed, her face serene, and her smile enigmatic, a smile that seemed to hold a secret, a secret that only Margaret could decipher, a secret that only she could understand."
"How the topic of weed came up I couldn’t remember—probably during one of the vigorous debates about what the twenty-first century had genuinely improved, which in",the opinion of the expats was a mixed bag. I was shortly handing my grinder and papers to Graham (who was far more adept at rolling).,"was a common refrain among the group of friends gathered at the small café, sipping their lattes and exchanging opinions on everything",52,"was a common refrain among the group of friends gathered at the small café, sipping their lattes and exchanging opinions on everything from social media to climate change, when someone mentioned the resurgence of interest in cannabis and its potential benefits for mental health, which in turn led to a heated discussion about the ethics of recreational use and the need for more research on its long-term effects, with some arguing that it was a harmless way to unwind and others claiming it was a slippery slope towards addiction, and as the conversation continued, it became clear that the lines between progress and regression were increasingly blurred, and the notion of what it meant to be ""improved"" was being redefined in the face of rapidly changing societal norms and values."
"Meeting Margaret made me vivid and receptive. Sentences weighed more. I kept a half-conscious catalog of where the men were looking. I’ve seen people deal with this in different ways. By “this,” I mean power. I mean magnetism. I try to absorb it. Within twenty minutes Margaret","and I were planning a girls-take-Soho night out, which necessitated me explaining the history of Soho, the concept of clubbing, the genre of R & B, the club night R & She, and dancing.

"“Such matters are between myself and God,” he said gravely. “Oh, stop frowning, Sixty-five.","Arthur, will you please lead her in a polka, if you can still stand.”","your face is as stern as the stone walls of this ancient monastery, but",28,"your face is as stern as the stone walls of this ancient monastery, but I sense a deep turmoil brewing beneath the surface, a turmoil that threatens to erupt at any moment, and I fear for the consequences of such an outburst."
"“In this age, musicians are imprinted inside music boxes, and there is no need for the band to","keep time,” said Margaret. “You will instruct me in the polka, or I will step on your toes.”","perform live, as the music is pre-recorded and can be played back at the touch of a button, but",36,"perform live, as the music is pre-recorded and can be played back at the touch of a button, but some artists still choose to defy convention and create a more authentic experience by playing their own instruments, often incorporating elements of improvisation and live interaction with the audience, which can lead to a more dynamic and engaging performance, and in some cases, a deeper connection with the listeners."
"Arthur, by contrast, danced beautifully. He dipped me, and I bent like","a reed. He spun me, and I was, with such satisfaction, spun.","felt the music swirling around me, the lights blurring into a",24,"felt the music swirling around me, the lights blurring into a kaleidoscope of colors as his hand rested lightly on the small of my back, guiding me effortlessly across the floor."
"As soon as she stepped in, I started making a tally of the evidence of unbeauty. There was a chair whose seat was filled with clothes too dirty for the wardrobe but too clean for the washing basket. My bedside table sprouted two water glasses and a mug. Dust crouched on the skirting boards and in the seams of","my chest of drawers. When a woman is as impossibly attractive as Margaret, the mediocrity shed by a woman like me bustles around her like a horde of pigeons. Or so I thought, at that time. Truthfully, I’d been foxed by how beautiful she was. I felt a complicated anguish when I saw her little besocked toes treadling the carpet.","The furniture, and the air was heavy with the scent of yesterday's dinner, which had been left to congeal in the kitchen.

The carpet was stained with mysterious splatters, and the windows, though clean, seemed to be coated with a fine layer of grime. My gaze wandered to the bookshelf, where a few volumes were precariously perched on the edge, threatening to topple over at any moment. The overall impression was one of neglect, as if the occupant had been absent for an extended period, leaving behind a trail of chaos and disorder. I couldn't help but wonder what had led to this state of affairs, and whether the person responsible would ever return to reclaim their space."
Margaret appeared unaware of any of these concerns. She didn’t even glance at herself,in the mirror. She gave me an interested grin as I pulled out my lipsticks.,"in the mirror, her eyes fixed intently on the small, intricately carved wooden",29,"in the mirror, her eyes fixed intently on the small, intricately carved wooden box that lay open on the dresser, its delicate patterns and inlays glinting softly in the morning light, as if beckoning her to uncover its secrets."
"I’d stopped wearing it—I was, at the time, thinking of the way my face might be received by a Victorian who didn’t approve of cosmetics—but I demonstrated the coverage of my sole foundation. Margaret","was amazed by the smoothness of its application and the faithfulness of its shade. She drew an arrow with it on her cheek. On her fair skin, it looked like clay.

"The door grumbled shut and I fell back into a doze. Margaret was snoring lightly, like a puppy being squeezed. The door reopened, and I","surfaced to vague consciousness. I felt a wave of cool air, and then a gentle warmth. He had spread a blanket over the pair of us.","was startled to see a figure standing in the doorway, its features illuminated by the faint moonlight that filtered through the window,",51,"was startled to see a figure standing in the doorway, its features illuminated by the faint moonlight that filtered through the window, and for a moment, I thought it was my mother, but as the figure took a step forward, I realized it was just the housekeeper, Mrs. Jenkins, with a look of concern etched on her face, and she whispered something that made my heart skip a beat, ""It's time to get up, child, it's time to face the truth."" The words hung in the air like a challenge, and I felt a shiver run down my spine as I slowly sat up and swung my legs over the side of the bed, my feet dangling in the darkness, and I knew that my life was about to change forever."
"All the expats had phones, paid for (and tapped) by the Ministry. Graham had switched his own phone on a total of three times in the seven","months he had been in the twenty-first century. I was therefore unsurprised when, about half an hour after their plane landed, I got a call from Arthur’s phone.","days since his arrival, and each time, the screen had lit up with a single, ominous message: ""Your cooperation is expected.""

The Ministry's surveillance was all-encompassing, and Graham had grown accustomed to the feeling of being watched, but the words still sent a shiver down his spine. He wondered who was behind the messages, and what they wanted from him, but the only response he could muster was a shrug, as if to say, ""I'm just a lowly expat, what could I possibly have to offer?"" Little did he know, his life was about to take a drastic turn, one that would force him to confront the true nature of the Ministry's intentions and the secrets they were hiding."
"Arthur was striding up the street, bent slightly against a wind which didn’t exist. He was wearing a tweed jacket and looked like a period piece,","but then again, so did Pimlico. I hadn’t seen him since the men had got back from Scotland and I asked him whether he enjoyed his trip.","as if he had stepped out of a 1950s film noir, the kind of character who would stumble into a smoky bar and order a whiskey on the rocks,",53,"as if he had stepped out of a 1950s film noir, the kind of character who would stumble into a smoky bar and order a whiskey on the rocks, his eyes scanning the room for a mysterious femme fatale. The people passing by on the sidewalk barely gave him a second glance, too caught up in their own lives to notice the anachronism that was Arthur, a man out of time, lost in a world that was rapidly changing around him."
"It paid off in the early autumn. When I came down for breakfast one morning, I found","Graham at the counter with a dictionary and a tin of protein powder, performing exegesis on the label.","that the garden was filled with a riot of color, the trees ablaze with vibrant hues of orange, red, and",35,"that the garden was filled with a riot of color, the trees ablaze with vibrant hues of orange, red, and yellow, and the air was crisp with the scent of ripe fruit and the promise of a new season."
"Adela was of the “never been to the GP in my life because I’m not a pussy” school of care, and nothing changed. If the expats were","dangerously ill, they’d be removed to the wards and never mind the trigger; if they could get a grip and deal with it at home, they should.","that they were any more likely to seek medical attention, they were wrong.

In fact, many of them seemed to be in worse health than the locals, possibly due to their reluctance to visit a doctor, and their tendency to self-medicate with over-the-counter remedies and questionable online advice. As a result, Adela's skepticism was not entirely unfounded, and she often found herself wondering if the expats' bravado was just a facade for a deeper-seated fear of vulnerability and a lack of trust in the local healthcare system."
"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs. Given the prevalence of prostitution in Victorian England, the nonexistence of reliable barrier contraception in his era, and the fact that he was a sailor, this suggested he was either a virgin or very lucky. But then again, I knew enough about his biography to know that he was very, very lucky.","of the Ministry's internal memo on Graham's case, which had been leaked to me by a sympathetic colleague, and it was clear that his analyst had been stumped by his patient's peculiar views on intimacy.

According to the memo, Graham believed that the idea of romantic love was a ""fanciful notion"" and that the only truly meaningful connections were those based on mutual respect and shared intellectual pursuits. I had to admit, this sounded a bit like the views of a certain philosopher I'd studied in college, but I couldn't quite put my finger on who it was. As I sat there, trying to make sense of Graham's enigmatic nature, I couldn't help but wonder if he was simply a product of his upbringing, or if there was something more to his story. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I didn't know him at all, and that our entire relationship was built on a foundation of uncertainty. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized that I might be in over my head, but I was determined to get to the bottom of things, no matter how strange they might get. Little did I know, things were about to get a lot stranger."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory. Every time I gave Graham a book, I was trying to shunt him along a story I’d been telling myself all my life.","something about her that made me want to peel away the layers, to uncover the depth of her thoughts and experiences, to see if the words she spoke were merely a reflection of the surface or a window into a more profound understanding of the world.

Her eyes sparkled with a quiet intensity, a sense that there was more to her than met the eye, and I found myself drawn to the mystery of her, like a moth to a flame. I wanted to know what made her tick, what drove her passions and her convictions, and whether the words she spoke were a reflection of her true self or a carefully crafted facade. As I looked at her, I couldn't help but wonder what secrets she might be hiding, what stories she might be telling herself, and what she might be afraid to share with the world."
Graham was adamant about not informing the Ministry about his illness. It was the closest I had,ever seen him to entreating. I thought about it a lot. I liked being entreated by him.,"seen him come close to revealing a secret, and I couldn't help but wonder what other mysteries",34,"seen him come close to revealing a secret, and I couldn't help but wonder what other mysteries lay hidden behind his stoic facade, as he carefully concealed his frailty from the prying eyes of the Ministry officials, who would surely exploit his weakness for their own gain."
"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled. Then again, whose upper management am I not describing? Who trusts their workplace? Who thinks their job is on the side of right? They fed us all poison from a bottle marked “prestige,” and we developed a high tolerance for bitterness. I would have been more frightened if the pressure lifted, like an indoor cat struck by sudden rain.","and I was young and foolish enough to believe her.

But it's too late now, and all I can do is live with the consequences of my actions, and try to make sense of the chaos that has ensued."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.","that a man of his stature, with a reputation for being one of the most astute investors in the city, could",39,"that a man of his stature, with a reputation for being one of the most astute investors in the city, could have been so thoroughly duped by a simple Ponzi scheme, and what he intended to do about it now that the truth was finally out."
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.","his fingers, staring out the window with an air of quiet contemplation that I had rarely seen in him before.

The aroma of roasting chicken wafted from the kitchen, mingling with the scent of burning leaves and damp earth, a smell that always seemed to signal the onset of autumn's chill. I hung my coat on the hook by the door and walked over to join him, my footsteps creaking on the wooden floorboards. ""Hey, what's on your mind?"" I asked, trying to sound casual, but Graham just shook his head and took a long drag on his cigarette, the ember glowing brightly in the fading light of day."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers. He took in anecdotes about my childhood meals as if they would contribute to a portrait of a whole woman. He ignored the fact that mostly I cooked assorted chicken pieces on rice. I could tell him things about galangal, and he found that very profound.","that seemed to emanate from the depths of the galaxy, his pencil scratching across the paper with a rhythmic intensity that was almost meditative.

His curiosity about Southeast Asian cuisine was a new development, one that I found both fascinating and a little disconcerting, as if he was trying to understand the intricacies of a foreign culture, much like he did with the mysteries of the universe. I remembered the first time he had shown me his sketches of distant planets and stars, the way his eyes would light up with wonder as he explained the science behind the celestial bodies, and now I saw a similar spark in his eyes as he savored the flavors of my mother's cooking, his mind working overtime to decipher the secrets of the complex sauces and spices. It was as if he was on a mission to explore the uncharted territories of taste, just as he had once explored the vast expanse of space, and I couldn't help but wonder what other culinary adventures lay ahead for him."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization. I wanted him in a role that didn’t require him to be at sea for months, possibly years,","at a time. It was too soon, I told myself. Whatever Adela said, he wasn’t ready, he’d barely left London, let alone land. But I wanted him to stay for other reasons too. It was humiliating to know that about myself and to say nothing into his implacable placidity.","at least not initially, and I envisioned him working in a desk job, perhaps in the naval headquarters or a research facility, where he could utilize his skills to contribute to the development of new technologies and strategies, while also being able to spend more",98,"at least not initially, and I envisioned him working in a desk job, perhaps in the naval headquarters or a research facility, where he could utilize his skills to contribute to the development of new technologies and strategies, while also being able to spend more time with me and our growing family, who were already adjusting to life on the mainland, and I had to admit, I was a bit concerned about how he would adapt to the drastic change in pace and lifestyle, from the freedom of the open sea to the monotony of a 9-to-5 job, but he was determined to make it work, and I was determined to support him, no matter what, as we navigated this new chapter in our lives together, and I knew that with time, patience, and understanding, we would find a balance that would allow us to thrive in our new surroundings, and I was excited to see the person he would become as he transitioned from a sailor to a civilian, and I was eager to explore the world with him, to experience all the wonders and challenges that life on the mainland had to offer, and to build a life together that was filled with love, laughter, and adventure."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.","was a song that Graham had always found to be a bit too sappy for his taste, but it somehow managed to perfectly capture the awkward, end-of-summer vibe that had settled over the group as they",64,"was a song that Graham had always found to be a bit too sappy for his taste, but it somehow managed to perfectly capture the awkward, end-of-summer vibe that had settled over the group as they sat in the dimly lit room, surrounded by the remnants of their failed attempts at a group project."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes. One of his first searches was charmingly housewifely: “Most challenging recipes”; “How to make cheese soufflé”; “What is miso paste?”; “Where to buy miso paste”; “How long has Japan been open to Europe?” A day or so after I’d read this report, I received another that listed the following search terms:","of his gullibility, that he'd been browsing through every manner of salacious content, his innocent eyes drinking in the lurid details of online forums and chat rooms, and that I'd have to intervene before he stumbled upon something truly incriminating, like a forum dedicated to the art of seduction or a chat room where people shared their most intimate fantasies.",122,"of his gullibility, that he'd been browsing through every manner of salacious content, his innocent eyes drinking in the lurid details of online forums and chat rooms, and that I'd have to intervene before he stumbled upon something truly incriminating, like a forum dedicated to the art of seduction or a chat room where people shared their most intimate fantasies. I envisioned the Ministry's stern-faced officials scrutinizing the data, their expressions a mixture of disappointment and concern, as they deliberated over the best course of action to take with my brother, who was supposed to be a model citizen, not some kind of cyber pervert. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets he might be hiding behind his awkward exterior, what other surprises lay in store for me as I delved deeper into his online activities."
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing,","as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday. This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option. We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit.

Some had even set up makeshift cafes, serving hot tea and sandwiches to those braving the elements. The smell of wet earth and ozone hung heavy in the air, a reminder of the storm's fury. As I waded through the water, I spotted a group of children playing in the shallows, their laughter carrying above the din of the rain. Their parents, huddled together under a tarpaulin, watched with a mix of concern and amusement. The council's efforts to mitigate the flood's impact were evident, but it was clear that this was a community that would not be defeated by the forces of nature. Despite the chaos, there was a sense of camaraderie that seemed to grow stronger with every passing minute. People were coming together, supporting one another, and finding ways to make the best of a bad situation. The storm may have been relentless, but the people of our street were proving to be just as determined."

"Adela’s voice contracted on that last sentence.

The email had been brief, but its impact was anything but, and I felt a cold sweat break out across my forehead as I tried to process the words that had been staring back at me from the screen. It was a message from an unknown sender, with no return address and no indication of who had sent it or why. But the words themselves were unmistakable, and they sent a chill down my spine as I read them over and over, trying to make sense of their meaning. ""They're watching you,"" the message had read. ""They've been watching you for a long time."" I felt a shiver run down my spine as I thought about the implications of those words, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being pulled into a world that was far beyond my control."

And what was that thing in my chest, that strange, pulsating sensation that seemed to be growing stronger by the second?"
