"It may be the first time I’m meeting the people gathered around the table, people who Ryan has known since childhood, but it hasn’t escaped anyone’s attention that I’m already fully embedded in his life. It’s the small touches","a woman brings to a man’s home, like the matching throw pillows on the couch or the faint whiff of jasmine from the diffuser on the bookshelf, that every other woman notices the second she walks through the front door.","that have made it seem like I've been a part of this family for years, from the way I effortlessly slide into conversations about their favorite TV shows to the way I instinctively know which coffee creamer Ryan takes in",79,"that have made it seem like I've been a part of this family for years, from the way I effortlessly slide into conversations about their favorite TV shows to the way I instinctively know which coffee creamer Ryan takes in his morning coffee. They're a tight-knit group, and I can tell they're sizing me up, trying to figure out what I'm doing here and whether I'm worthy of being part of their inner circle. Some of them exchange knowing glances, while others try to engage me in conversation, asking me questions about my interests and hobbies. I do my best to be friendly and charming, but I can sense a hint of skepticism lingering beneath the surface. It's clear that I still have a lot to prove, and I'm determined to win them over, not just for Ryan's sake, but for my own."
The smile on Ryan’s face tells me he knows how I feel about being asked,"this and he’ll step in again to answer for me, but I shake him off.","to be part of this project, but I'm not sure if he's aware of the extent",30,"to be part of this project, but I'm not sure if he's aware of the extent of my reservations, which range from the lack of clear objectives to the uncertainty surrounding the team's dynamics."
"Ryan would have given them more than they deserve, and that’s why I stopped him. I don’t mention it was at the truck stop on the outskirts of town where I worked in the","small restaurant bar making sure no drink went empty. And I don’t mention that while they are familiar with lots of acronyms from MBA to MRS, the only one I’m acquainted with is GED.","past, where the neon lights of the diner reflected off the wet pavement, and the smell of greasy food and diesel fuel hung heavy in the air, but I digress.

It was a typical Tuesday evening, with the usual crowd of truckers and locals filtering in and out, when I saw him, his face a picture of determination as he argued with the owner, a gruff old man with a thick beard and a scowl that could curdle milk at twenty paces."
"I told Ryan I was afraid of how they would judge me once they found out my background was so different from theirs. He assured me he didn’t care what they thought, but he does. The fact that he caved","and invited them all here and spent the week helping me get the menu just right tells me more than the whispers in the dark that he likes how different I am, different from the girls he grew up with.","to their pressure and started to distance himself from me, I realized that he was not as accepting as he claimed to be. It was a painful realization, especially since I had confided in him about my past,",80,"that he caved to their pressure and started to distance himself from me, I realized that he was not as accepting as he claimed to be. It was a painful realization, especially since I had confided in him about my past, thinking that he would be a source of support and understanding. But now, I felt betrayed and hurt by his actions, which seemed to suggest that he was more concerned with what others thought of me than with our relationship itself. The more I thought about it, the more I felt a sense of disillusionment and disappointment, wondering if I had been naive to think that I could ever truly be myself around him. It was a harsh lesson in the importance of being cautious when it comes to those who claim to be supportive, but ultimately prove to be anything but. I couldn't help but wonder if I had been blind to the warning signs, or if I had simply been too desperate for someone to accept me for who I am. Whatever the case may be, I knew that I deserved better, and I was determined to find someone who would love and accept me for my true self, without condition or pretence."
I watch Ryan. I’ve whittled down our entire meeting to one,"sentence, and so far, he’s let me get away with it.","was a single, piercing glance, and in that moment, I",22,"was a single, piercing glance, and in that moment, I knew exactly what he was going to say, or rather, what he was not going to say, and that was what really mattered."
"I smile and laugh, not too loud and not too long, to show that I,","too, am amused at the thought that Ryan would go to such extremes to meet me.","am not entirely serious about the joke, but still want to be polite and friendly,",31,"am not entirely serious about the joke, but still want to be polite and friendly, and perhaps even a little bit mysterious, to keep people guessing and wondering what I'm really thinking."
"“I totally nailed it,” I say, as I dip the last dinner plate into the sink full of soapy water. Ryan moves in behind me, his arms skimming my hips","until they are wrapped around my waist. His chin settles on my shoulder, and his lips press against that spot on my neck in a way he knows I adore.","and his chest brushing against my lower back, sending a shiver down my spine.

I feel a flutter in my chest as he wraps his arms around me, his warm breath on my neck making me close my eyes in anticipation. The water splashes and bubbles around us, a soothing melody that seems to match the rhythm of my beating heart. I lean back into him, feeling the tension in my shoulders ease as his strong arms hold me close. ""You're a natural,"" he whispers, his voice low and husky, sending a thrill through me. I smile, feeling a sense of contentment wash over me as we stand there, surrounded by the warm water and the quiet of the evening."
"Ever since Ryan asked me to move in with him five days ago and I said yes, he’s been impatient for it to happen. I woke up","the morning after the dinner party to him on the phone with a moving company, scheduling their services for later that day, thanks to a last-minute cancellation.","to find him pacing around the living room, checking the moving truck's estimated arrival time for what felt like the hundredth time that morning.

His enthusiasm was infectious, but I couldn't help feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness as I began to envision our life together in this new space. The thought of merging our belongings, our routines, and our personalities into one home was both thrilling and daunting. I tried to shake off the feeling of uncertainty that lingered in the back of my mind, focusing instead on the countless memories we would create in this new chapter of our lives. As I got out of bed and started getting ready for the day, Ryan came over to give me a reassuring kiss on the cheek, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude for this new beginning we were embarking on together."
"Ryan looks down at the tie, straightening it even though it’s already straight but needing something","to do. He hasn’t touched me this morning and barely looked at me. Yep, total baby.","to fill the awkward silence that has fallen between him and his boss, who is now scrutinizing",32,"to fill the awkward silence that has fallen between him and his boss, who is now scrutinizing him with an unspoken expectation."
"Twenty minutes after Ryan’s Tahoe pulls out of the driveway, I’m doing the same in my ten-year-old 4Runner. Lake Forbing is a medium-size town in north Louisiana that is known for its fertile farmlands and deep pockets of natural gas. There","is a lot of money in this area, but it’s the quiet kind. It takes fifteen minutes to get to Lake View Apartments from Ryan’s house, and from what I can tell it’s nowhere near the lake this town was named after.","The landscape of Lake Forbing is dotted with fields of sugarcane and soybeans, and the air is thick with the sweet scent of blooming magnolias.

As I drive down the main street, I pass by the old general store, the diner, and the gas station, all of which seem frozen in time, as if the town has been preserved in a state of suspended animation. The streets are empty, save for the occasional passerby, and the only sound is the hum of my engine and the chirping of birds in the trees. I take a deep breath, feeling a sense of nostalgia wash over me as I make my way out of town, leaving the familiarity of Lake Forbing behind. The highway stretches out before me, a long and winding road that promises adventure and uncertainty, and I feel a thrill of excitement as I hit the open road, the speedometer climbing higher and higher as I pick up speed. The world seems to blur by in a green and brown haze, and I feel alive, free, and unencumbered, with nothing but the wind in my hair and the sun on my face."

Things Pat has been storing for me in that box truck",until I was ready for him to bring them here. Things that I will move to Ryan’s house on Saturday.

"In the kitchen area, I unzip the black bag and remove four menus from nearby restaurants and three pictures I printed from the kiosk at CVS of Ryan and me, plus seven magnets to hold each item in place on the refrigerator. Next, I grab the assortment of condiments and pour half of each one down the sink drain before lining them in the door of the refrigerator. Moving to the bathroom, black bag in tow, I pull out the shampoo and conditioner then pour half of each down the drain like I did with the condiments, before putting the bottles on the edge of","the tub. Unwrapping a bar of Lever 2000 soap, I set it on top of the drain in the sink and turn the water on, rotating it every few minutes until the logo is gone and the edges are dulled, then drop it into the small built-in space on the shower wall. Toothpaste is last. Starting from the bottom, I squeeze a portion out but leave a glob or two on the rim of the sink, just like I do at Ryan’s house, even though I know he’ll fuss about it.

As I continue to sort through the clothes and personal items, I start to feel a sense of unease, as if I'm being watched, and I catch myself glancing over my shoulder, wondering if I've left anything behind. The sound of the clock ticking on the wall seems to grow louder, and I quicken my pace, trying to finish the task as efficiently as possible. I take a deep breath and focus on the task at hand, trying to push aside the feeling of being on edge.

"I slide my hands into my front pockets and lean back against the wall next to the kitchen counter, crossing one ankle in front of the other. My movements are slow but calculated. It worries me she’s here, checking on me, and that she’ll feel the same","need to do so on Saturday, when Ryan is here moving me out.

The ache in my chest still feels raw, like an open wound that's been ripped open all over again. I take a deep breath, trying to calm myself down, but my mind keeps racing back to the memories of our time together. I can still feel her touch, still remember the way she smiled at me. It's like my brain is trying to tell me something, but I'm not sure what. I glance around the room, hoping to find some distraction, but everything feels empty and hollow without her. The silence is deafening, and I'm starting to feel like I'm drowning in it. I push off from the wall and take a step forward, my eyes scanning the room for something, anything, to focus on. But there's nothing. Just the echoes of our past, haunting me, reminding me of what I've lost."
"It must have piqued her interest when I rented one of the few unfurnished units. Usually if someone goes to the trouble of moving furniture in, they plan on staying longer than seven days, but I didn’t want Ryan to think my","life was so transient that I didn’t even have my own couch so the furnished unit wasn’t an option.

The landlord, a friendly woman named Mrs. Jenkins, seemed to understand my intentions, and we settled on a short-term lease. I handed over the first month's rent and a security deposit, and she handed me a set of keys to the small studio apartment. As I unlocked the door and stepped inside, I was hit with a wave of excitement and nervousness. The blank walls and empty space seemed to stretch out before me like a canvas waiting for my brushstrokes. I took a deep breath and began to imagine all the possibilities, the way I could make this place my own, and the memories I could create within its walls. But as I looked around at the bare essentials, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched, and I wondered if Mrs. Jenkins had been telling the truth when she said the apartment had a bit of a reputation."
"She clucks her tongue against the roof of her mouth, then turns to leave. It takes everything in me not to throw the bolt closed","behind her. But I’m almost finished here, and there’s still more to be done before Ryan crosses the Louisiana state line at five thirty this afternoon.","behind her, but I'm not sure I'm ready to let her go just yet.

"From the way Ryan tells it, one day he dropped by to check on his grandfather, only to find he had died peacefully in his sleep, and then a week later Ryan was moving in.","The only possessions he brought with him were his clothes, toiletries, and a new mattress for the bedroom.

"But it’s too big for Ryan. It’s two stories with a wide front porch and big backyard, white with dark green shutters, manicured flower beds, and a brick path that leads to the front",door. It would take several minutes to walk through if you needed to check every room—big enough that someone could come in the carport door and you wouldn’t hear it from the main bedroom.,"The house is a beautiful colonial-style home, with a large living room, a spacious kitchen, and three bedrooms upstairs, each with its own bathroom.

The neighbors are friendly and welcoming, and the location is close to the town center, making it an ideal place to live for families or young professionals."
They are silent spectators as I unload box after box. Ryan is pulling into the driveway just as I,grab the last one.

"Mrs. Rogers stands up and walks to the edge of the porch, putting her as close as",she can get without falling into her azalea bushes. “Y’all look busy over there!” she hollers back.,"possible to the railing, her eyes scanning the darkness beyond the flickering porch light, her voice",34,"possible to the railing, her eyes scanning the darkness beyond the flickering porch light, her voice barely above a whisper as she says, ""I've been waiting for this moment for what feels like an eternity, and I'm not sure I'm ready for it, but I know I have to be, for the sake of our family and our future, and the weight of it all is crushing me, making it hard to breathe, but I'll find a way to get through it, I have to, for the people I love, and the life we're building together."""
Ryan laughs. “It’s been a while since I’ve had one of your Old Fashioneds. I’m looking forward,to it.” Then he knocks his shoulder lightly against mine to get me moving toward the house.,to savoring the complex flavors and aromas that come with it.

I remember the way the ice would clink against the glass, the way the liquid would swirl and mix, and the way the flavors would unfold on my palate. It's a sensory experience like no other, and one that I've always associated with warmth, comfort, and nostalgia. As I take my first sip, I'm hit with the familiar sensation of being enveloped in a sense of calm and contentment, and I know that this is exactly what I needed after a long, stressful week."
Ryan is always tight lipped about what he does on Thursdays. And while,"he joked this morning about skipping work today, we both know he never would.","it is understandable that he would want to keep some aspects of his life private,",27,"it is understandable that he would want to keep some aspects of his life private, but his secrecy has led to a multitude of speculations and rumors among his colleagues, ranging from him being a secret agent to a high-stakes gambler, with some even going so far as to claim that he is involved in some sort of underground fighting ring, although none of these theories have been proven or even remotely confirmed, leaving everyone to continue to wonder what he really does on those mysterious Thursdays."
Ryan follows me back to the apartment in his Tahoe. I’m glad I’m not in the car with him when,"he realizes where we’re going, but at least the idea that I was embarrassed about where I live rings true.","he slams on the brakes at the red light, his anger and frustration radiating through the vehicle like a palpable",40,"he slams on the brakes at the red light, his anger and frustration radiating through the vehicle like a palpable force, making me wonder if I've made a huge mistake by getting into this situation, and as I glance over at him, I notice the tension in his jaw and the furrowed brow, and I realize that I'm not sure if he's more angry with me or with himself for letting things go this far."
"The lock gives a bit easier this time, and the second the door swings open Ryan has us inside and the door shut behind us. He paces the apartment with","his hands on his hips. I hate to admit I like his growling prowl of the room, and the protective instinct vibrating through him is as foreign as it is welcome.","his eyes scanning the room, ensuring we're truly alone, before turning to us with a mixture of relief and a hint of wariness, his voice barely above a whisper as",61,"his eyes scanning the room, ensuring we're truly alone, before turning to us with a mixture of relief and a hint of wariness, his voice barely above a whisper as he says, ""We need to talk, but first, let me get you something to drink, you must be freezing, it's freezing outside, and I have hot tea and some blankets in the kitchen, just, please, just wait here for a minute, I'll be right back."""
"Ryan moves to the counter and picks up the closest perfume bottle.

I’m late for lunch with the girls. Sara and I texted back and forth over the course of the last few days trying to find a day that,"worked for everyone, and while adding me to their group message would have saved a lot of time, it will take more than one dinner party for that invitation.","worked for everyone, but it seems like we finally settled on today.

"“But you shouldn’t have to handle that.” His hand reaches for mine, then he’s pulling me into his lap. I glance at the open door, hoping no one","catches us like this.

The voice on the other end is unfamiliar, but the words that follow send a shiver down his spine, ""Ryan, I know what you did last night, and I'm not the only one."" The line goes dead, leaving Ryan standing there, frozen in shock, his mind racing with possibilities and questions."

I try to push the thoughts aside and focus on the task at hand, but my curiosity gets the better of me. I sneak a glance at Ryan, who's now staring at me with an intensity that makes me feel like I'm under a microscope.

The air in the room seems to thicken, and I can sense that something is about to change, but I'm not sure what."

"Moving in with Ryan has upped his romance game: simple touches, sweet words and gestures, going out of his way to make sure I’m happy. When he’s not at work, we’re together.

"Before long, she wanders off to deliver more hugs, and Ryan gets into a deep conversation with a local judge about an upcoming election, so I take a moment to look around. This place is beautiful. The winding driveway was long enough that you can’t see the main road or hear any traffic from the house, making it feel like this party is hidden from the rest of the world—just as its name suggests.

"I head straight for the tiny room at the front of our trailer that is nothing more than a large closet, but it’s like stepping into another world when I pass through the door.

He heads inside and I sit back and stare at the sky. It’s been a few days since I spied on him at the warehouse and the mailbox is still empty.

He nods and gestures for me to come inside. He checks his watch for the second time since,"he’s opened the door, then yells toward the wraparound stairs that curve up the foyer wall. “Jenny!

I open drawers and rummage through every part of the room. It’s big enough that there’s a sitting area tucked in a corner near,"the door that leads to the bathroom.

I continue my search, moving from one end of the room to the other, checking every nook and cranny, but so far, I haven't found anything out of the ordinary. The room seems to be just as it was left, with everything in its place, but I'm not convinced that's the case. I keep searching, my eyes scanning the floor, the shelves, and the furniture, but I'm starting to feel like I'm missing something obvious. I take a step back and look around the room again, this time taking in the layout and trying to think of where someone might hide something. The sitting area catches my eye, and I walk over to investigate, wondering if there's a possibility that whatever I'm looking for might be hidden in the cushions or behind the chair."

We chatted about everything from our favorite memories to our future plans, and I found myself getting lost in the nostalgia of it all. The miles flew by, and before I knew it, we were approaching the outskirts of Raleigh, the city lights twinkling in the distance. I pulled over at a quaint little diner on the side of the road, and we stepped out to grab a bite to eat and take in the view.

I shove a few fries in my mouth while I consider my next move. “I need to go to Austin for a few days. Tate is having a huge Fourth of July party at his house this weekend. Might be the best time to hit him if you can get it,"all figured out by then. Get everything we need while I’m gone.” It’s a risk putting it off since I don’t know who else or even how many other people are trying to get that painting, but it’s a risk worth taking, especially if Devon needs more time on his end.","get your hands on some of his contacts.

If I can just get a meeting with him, I might be able to land that big project I've been going for. I've heard his party is going to be epic, with live music and a huge BBQ. I'm sure he'll be there with all his high-profile connections, and it'll be the perfect opportunity to network and make some valuable connections. I just need to figure out how to get an invite, and then I'll be set. I'll start by calling his assistant and see if I can get a confirmation of the party details. Maybe I can even get a plus one for my friend, Rachel, who's been looking for a new job in the industry. With any luck, this could be the break we both need. I'll make a mental note to pack my sunscreen and a good pair of dancing shoes, because I'm going to make the most of this opportunity and make some unforgettable memories. I'll also bring some business cards and a few copies of my portfolio, just in case I need to make a good impression. I'm getting excited just thinking about it, and I know this is going to be a weekend to remember."
Sawyer gives me a grin while he grabs my ass with one hand and pushes open the back door with the other. He’s going,"to be a tough one to wrangle. But if there’s one thing I know, it’s how to handle trust fund babies with big egos.","to step aside, allowing me to slip out into the warm summer evening, the smell of freshly cut grass and blooming flowers",48,"to step aside, allowing me to slip out into the warm summer evening, the smell of freshly cut grass and blooming flowers enveloping me as I make my way down the creaky porch steps, the sound of crickets and the distant hum of a lawnmower filling the air, as I take a deep breath, feeling the cool breeze rustle my hair, and glance back at Sawyer, who's still standing in the doorway, a mischievous glint in his eye, a hint of a smile still playing on his lips, as if he's waiting for me to make the next move, to see where this unexpected turn of events will lead us."
"Sawyer and I, along with twenty of his closest friends, show up an hour late. I’ve done as much recon on this little group as I can, trying to see if anyone else is using him to","get inside the house, but they have been fried since last night, so I think I’m the only plant. It didn’t hurt being the girl to show up with the edibles to ensure they stayed that way.","get to the front of the line, but it seems like they're all genuinely interested in meeting me.

They're a mix of entrepreneurs, artists, and musicians, all in their mid-twenties to early thirties, and they all seem to be at the top of their respective fields. Sawyer introduces me to each of them, and I try to remember names and faces, but it's a bit overwhelming. We're ushered into a private room, where a projector screen takes up most of the wall, and a large wooden table sits in the center of the room. Sawyer explains that this is where the real discussion will take place, and that we'll be brainstorming ideas for a new sustainable energy project. I take a deep breath, trying to process everything that's happening, and prepare myself for the long night ahead."
"Like clockwork, Amy pushes through the double glass doors of the bar at 5:25 p.m. For the last two weeks, she has stayed home until","around five in the evening, then she commutes a measly two miles to this country club, where she’ll drown herself in vodka martinis until closing.","now, the daily routine of her job as a waitress has become a monotonous cycle, but the smell of freshly brewed coffee and the chatter of familiar faces",50,"now, the daily routine of her job as a waitress has become a monotonous cycle, but the smell of freshly brewed coffee and the chatter of familiar faces momentarily lift her spirits as she clocks in and begins her shift, exchanging a warm smile with her coworker, Rachel, who is already prepping the bar for the evening rush."
Amy is five foot seven with an athletic build and honey-blond hair that hits right below,"her shoulders. The makeup is light, the jewelry is nonexistent, and she rocks a perpetual resting-bitch face.","her chin, and her bright blue eyes sparkle with a hint of mischief that is often lost on those who don't know",33,"her chin, and her bright blue eyes sparkle with a hint of mischief that is often lost on those who don't know her well, but it's a trait that has earned her a reputation as a fierce competitor in the world of professional sports, where she has spent the better part of a decade honing her skills and pushing herself to the limit, and it's a reputation that she intends to uphold as she prepares to take on the toughest challenge of her career yet, a challenge that will require all of her strength, speed, and agility, and more."
"Amy brings her glass to her lips and takes a deep drink, finishing it off, then waves the empty","glass in the air. “You’ll never, ever, ever find it!” She’s loud enough that several heads turn her way.","gently in the air, a gesture that seems almost carefree, yet hints at a deeper complexity, as she sets the",38,"gently in the air, a gesture that seems almost carefree, yet hints at a deeper complexity, as she sets the glass down on the nearby table, her eyes drifting towards the window, where the fading light of day casts a warm glow on the room, and for a moment, she stands there, suspended in a world of her own thoughts, the silence between her and the others at the table growing thicker, like the scent of the wine still lingering on her lips."
"Opening the driver’s-side door, I catch her before she falls out onto the concrete. I dig through her purse to find her keys, shoving them in my pocket. Grabbing Amy underneath her arms, I drag her from the car and up the driveway. She loses one shoe and then the other. I","almost want to flip off the camera I know is pointed at me, but I resist and keep my body turned away from the street as much as possible. It’s slow and steady until we get to the front door. Blessed silence meets us as I get the door unlocked and open.","am relieved to see the front door of the house is unlocked, and I manage to get her inside without her collapsing.

I lay her down on the couch, trying to catch my breath as I take in the scene. The living room is a mess, with clothes scattered all over the floor and empty pizza boxes stacked up against the wall. I quickly rummage through her purse again to find her phone, hoping to call for help, but it's dead. I try to remember the last time I saw her, wondering if she'd been drinking or if something else was going on. The sound of sirens can be heard in the distance, and I know I need to act fast. I try to stay calm, but my mind is racing with worst-case scenarios. I take a deep breath and try to focus on the task at hand, which is getting her the help she needs. I quickly scan the room for a first aid kit or any other supplies that might be useful, but all I can find is a half-empty bottle of water and a box of tissues. I grab the water and try to get her to drink some, but she's unresponsive. I'm starting to get really scared now, and I know I need to think clearly if I'm going to get her through this. I try to remember if she has any medical conditions or allergies that I should be aware of, but my mind is a blank.
