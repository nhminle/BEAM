But as I grew older, I started to see the world in a different light, and the notion of marriage began to seem less like a far-off fantasy and more like a tangible reality, one that I was both drawn to and terrified of. The thought of sharing my life with someone, of building a home and starting a family, was a daunting prospect, but it was also one that filled me with a sense of excitement and possibility. I had always been the type of person who valued independence and freedom above all else, but as I approached adulthood, I started to realize that there was more to life than just being alone, and that the idea of finding someone to share it with was not as scary as I had once thought."
"That was fourteen years ago, though, and Serena never married me. In fact, she’s long gone. I’m here alone, with a giant heap of","expensive wedding favors that’ll hopefully fool guests into overlooking the lack of love, genetic compatibility, or even previous acquaintance between me and the groom.","dusty boxes, old photographs, and faded memories that I've been slowly sorting through, trying to make sense of the life we once shared.

The silence is deafening, a constant reminder that time keeps moving, even when it feels like it's standing still. I've been thinking a lot about Serena lately, wondering what could have been if she had stayed. Would we have built a life together, or would we have grown apart like so many others? The not knowing is a heavy burden to carry, one that I'm not sure I'll ever shake. As I sit here, surrounded by the remnants of our past, I'm left with more questions than answers. What if I had been more patient? What if I had been more understanding? What if I had been more in love? The what-ifs swirl in my head like a never-ending storm, each one a reminder of the choices we made, and the paths we took. I'm not sure I'll ever find peace, but I'll keep searching, one box at a time."
I did try to arrange a meeting. Suggested to my people that they suggest to his people that we could grab lunch the week before the ceremony. Coffee the previous day. A glass of tap water the morning of—anything to avoid a “How do you do?” in front of the officiant.

I tried to explain that it wasn't just about avoiding awkwardness, but about avoiding any potential conflict that could arise from our complicated past. But my words fell on deaf ears, and the plan remained unchanged. The week leading up to the ceremony was a blur of last-minute preparations and anxious anticipation, with my people seemingly oblivious to the tension that hung in the air. I, on the other hand, was a nervous wreck, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios and what-ifs. The coffee date was still on, and I couldn't shake the feeling that it was going to be a disaster waiting to happen."
"One of the agents stops us in front of the double doors that lead into the courtyard. “Councilman Lark, Miss Lark, one minute.

We exchange a brief, questioning glance, but the agent's expression remains impassive, offering no hint as to what we might expect from the council. The minutes tick by at a glacial pace, each one feeling like an eternity as we wait for our audience with the council, our minds racing with possibilities and worst-case scenarios. The silence is oppressive, punctuated only by the occasional creak of the old building's wooden floorboards beneath our feet."

"The first things I notice are the two walls of windows, which is exactly what Father wants. Every Human I’ve talked with assumes that Vampyres hate light and relish darkness, but they couldn’t be more wrong. The sun may be forbidden to us, toxic always and deathly in large quantities, but that’s precisely why","we covet it with such intensity.

Father's design is a masterclass in subtlety, a clever manipulation of light and shadow that creates an ambiance both soothing and invigorating. As I gaze out at the breathtaking view, I feel my senses come alive, and for a moment, I forget the weight of our eternal curse. The world outside may be a harsh and unforgiving place, but in this sanctuary, all is right with the world."
"“Whose? Yours? Are you going to . . .” I don’t bother finishing the sentence—the sheer thought is ludicrous. It’s not just weddings that have gone out of fashion hundreds of years ago, but the entire idea","of long-term relationships.

People used to believe that love was a necessary foundation for marriage, but now it seems like a quaint notion, a relic of a bygone era. The idea of finding one's soulmate, of being swept off one's feet by a romantic gesture, has given way to a more practical and pragmatic approach to relationships. Couples are now more likely to prioritize stability, security, and compatibility over grand romantic gestures and sweeping declarations of love. It's a shift that has been gradual, but it's one that has been gaining momentum over the past few decades, and it's hard to imagine a time when people would have been shocked by the idea of a marriage without a deep emotional connection. But still, there are those who hold onto the old ways, who believe that true love is still the key to a happy and fulfilling marriage, and who are willing to wait for that special someone to come along and sweep them off their feet."

Without hesitation, they climbed aboard, and as they pushed off from the shore, the current swept them downstream, carrying them further and further away from the safety of the riverbank. The music and laughter of the party grew fainter and fainter, until it was nothing more than a distant echo, and the four friends were left alone in the darkness, with nothing but the sound of the water rushing past them to keep them company. As they floated along, they began to feel a sense of exhilaration and freedom, as if they were invincible, and that nothing could ever bring them back down to reality.

"“The other children knew that I’d be the one sent to the Humans, and they started calling me fangless traitor as soon as they could form full sentences.

The air is thick with tension, the weight of their history and the uncertainty of their future hanging precariously in the balance.

But even then, we have to be mindful of the UV rays that can still seep through the windows, especially during the summer months when the sun's rays are stronger. It's a delicate balance, really, between our need for sunlight and our aversion to it. And it's not just the sun itself that's the problem – it's the way it affects our moods, too. When we're exposed to too much sunlight, we can become irritable, anxious, and even a bit...prickly. It's not exactly pleasant for those around us, I assure you. So, while we may not be as fragile as popular myth would have you believe, we're still not exactly built for the bright lights and sunshine.

I take a step forward, my eyes locked on hers, and for a moment, it feels like time stands still. But the moment is short-lived, and the reality of our situation comes crashing back in. The boxes, the clothes, the empty space – it's all a reminder that we can't stay here forever. We need to make a decision, and soon. But for now, I just stand there, frozen, unsure of what to say or do next."
"No shit. “And I don’t know you enough to make a judgment. Your jeans are cool,","though.” Riveting conversation, but I’m about to pass out. Thankfully, with one last withering look, Juno leaves.","but that's not enough to convince me that you're a decent human being.

"The corner of my eye catches a hint of movement. I turn, half expecting Ana to make","a comeback, but it’s just Serena’s goddamned fucking cat, stretching his way out from under the bed.","be some sort of joke, but instead, I see her standing by the window, her eyes fixed intently on something",34,"be some sort of joke, but instead, I see her standing by the window, her eyes fixed intently on something outside, her face a mixture of concern and curiosity etched on her features, and I sense that whatever has caught her attention is not just a trivial matter, but something that requires my attention as well, and I feel a shiver run down my spine as I wonder what it could be, and I take a step closer to her, my heart beating slightly faster, as I try to understand what's going on, and I notice that she's not alone, there's someone else standing with her, someone I've never seen before, and I feel a surge of unease as I try to process this new information, and I wonder who this person is, and what they want, and why they're here, and I try to read Ana's expression, but her face is a mask, giving away nothing, and I'm left with more questions than answers, and I feel a sense of unease growing inside me, as I try to make sense of this unexpected turn of events."
"Growing up collecting attempted murders like milk teeth tempered me and taught me to be calm under pressure. And yet I still remember it, that first churning twist in my stomach when Serena didn’t","turn up to my place for laundry night. Didn’t reply to my texts. Didn’t pick up the phone.

"“A few days? She still wouldn’t let the little asshole starve,” I hurried to add, but the officer had already dropped his pen. And even though I went back to the station three times that week, and eventually managed to get a missing person report filed, no one did anything","to find Serena. The hazard, I guess, of being alone in the world: no one to care that she was safe, and healthy, and alive. No one but me, and I didn’t count. I shouldn’t have been surprised, and I wasn’t. But apparently I still had the capacity to feel hurt.","about it, and I couldn't help but wonder if it was because of the officer's dismissive attitude or the fact that the victim was a homeless teenager, a statistic easily lost in the system.

The more I thought about it, the more I felt a sense of responsibility, a nagging feeling that I had let her down, that I could have done more to help. I couldn't shake the image of her pale face, her sunken eyes, and her desperate attempt to smile as she handed me the crumpled piece of paper with her name and address scrawled on it. The more I replayed our conversation in my head, the more I realized that I had been too quick to assume she was just another lost soul, another statistic, and not a real person with a story worth telling. I knew I had to keep pushing, to keep searching for answers, no matter how small they might seem, and to make sure that her memory didn't fade away like so many others before her."
"Because no one cared whether I was safe, or healthy, or alive. No one but Serena. The sister of my heart,","if not of my blood.

"I had the keys, after all. Because the key to everything is but a line of code. I was able to rifle through her bank statements, IP addresses, cell phone locations. Herald emails, metadata, app usage. Serena was a journalist, one who","wrote about delicate financial stuff, and the most likely option was that she’d gotten embroiled in something fishy while working on a story, but I wasn’t going to exclude other possibilities. So I went through everything, and found . . . nothing.","had a reputation for being meticulous and thorough in her reporting, but even she couldn't have anticipated the extent to which her digital trail would be exposed.

The more I dug, the more I uncovered a complex web of connections between her sources, her informants, and her targets. I found encrypted files, password-protected documents, and even a few cryptic messages that seemed to hint at a larger story, one that went far beyond the scope of her current project. It was as if Serena had been playing a game of cat and mouse with her sources, always staying one step ahead of them, but also leaving behind a trail of digital breadcrumbs that I was now following. I couldn't help but wonder what she had been investigating, and what she had uncovered before her untimely death. The more I learned, the more I realized that I had stumbled upon something much bigger than a simple hacking job. It was a puzzle, and I was determined to solve it, no matter the cost."
"And that’s when I did it: I kneeled in front of Serena’s damn fucking cat. He was playing like he always did after dinner, pawing at a crumpled receipt in a corner of the living room, but managed to squeeze a couple of hisses into his busy schedule just for me. “Listen.” I swallowed.

I've been noticing some things, and I have to ask you, are you okay? Is everything all right?"" I looked up at her, searching for any sign of deception, but her expression remained neutral, a mask that hid her true emotions.

"Or maybe not quite. A distant bell rang, reminding me of a game Serena and I used to play as kids, a primitive substitution cipher we made up to gossip freely in front of our caregivers. We’d named it the butterfly alphabet, and","it mostly consisted of adding b- and f- syllables to normal words. Nothing complicated: even rusty as I was, it took my brain only a few seconds to untangle it. And once I was done, I had something.

Even now, as I stood in the old mansion, the sound of the bell brought back a flood of memories, and I couldn't help but wonder if Serena was thinking of the same thing, or if she'd moved on to greener pastures, leaving me to reminisce about the good old days. The sound of the bell seemed to hang in the air, a nostalgic echo of a bygone era, and I felt a pang of longing for the carefree days of my youth, when life was simple, and the only thing that mattered was the thrill of the game, and the secrets we shared with each other."

Serena’s face flashes through my head. She’s rolling her eyes because I’m wearing a galaxy T-shirt I,"got for free when I bought a lava lamp. Who wears this, Misery?

"It’s a barbecue, or a potluck, or a cookout—I never quite got the difference, despite Serena’s explanations on the nuances of Human social get-togethers.

But even with all these communal events, I still find myself feeling like an outsider, like I don't quite fit in with the rest of the vamphyres. Maybe it's because I'm a hybrid, a mix of human and vampire, or maybe it's just because I've always been a bit of a loner. Whatever the reason, I know that I'm not like the others, and that feeling of not belonging has been a constant companion of mine for as long as I can remember."

I find myself drawn to him, wondering what brought him to this secluded spot, and what's weighing on his mind. The sound of the waves crashing against the shore creates a soothing melody, but his presence seems to disrupt the tranquility of the atmosphere, as if he's a storm brewing in the distance, waiting to unleash its fury. His hair is messy, and his clothes are worn, giving off a sense of a carefree spirit, but the intensity in his eyes suggests a depth that's hard to ignore.

But now that I'm older, I realize it's just a natural response to protect us from potential threats. Still, I'm not sure why this particular encounter with him has me on edge. Maybe it's the way he looked at me, like he knew a secret I didn't. Or perhaps it's the way he seemed to be watching me, even when I wasn't looking at him. Whatever the reason, I know I need to be more cautious around him, at least for now. I've been trying to brush it off as mere paranoia, but the feeling persists. I've been thinking about it nonstop, replaying our encounter in my mind, trying to make sense of it all. I've also been wondering if there's something I'm missing, something that could explain why he's been lingering around the facility. I've tried to gather more information, but the staff seems tight-lipped about the whole thing. They just keep telling me that he's a researcher, here to study the new wing, but I'm not buying it. There's something more to it, I'm sure of it. I just need to figure out what that is."

"“No.” He stares at the moonlit water. “When we were young, I was there when Koen’s sister met her mate. We were on a run. She smelled her, suddenly went real still",in the middle of the field. I thought she was having a stroke.” He smiles. “She said that it felt like discovering new colors. Like the rainbow had gained a few stripes.”,"and her eyes locked onto him, her entire body tense, as if she had sensed something profound.

The pack was moving swiftly, but she hung back, her gaze fixed on the stranger, and I remember thinking it was strange, but also somehow beautiful, the way she seemed to be drawn to him, like a moth to flame. Koen's sister had always been a bit of a free spirit, and I had expected her to be more cautious, but there was something about this stranger that had captured her attention, and I recall feeling a sense of wonder, a sense of awe, as I watched the two of them, the way they seemed to be connected, like two pieces of a puzzle finally fitting together."
