The financial reports showed a steady increase in revenue, with his most popular series being adapted into a successful video game. His publisher was eager to negotiate a new deal, and I was tasked with reviewing the proposal, which included a significant advance and a guaranteed minimum number of books. Meanwhile, the movie option was still in development, with a well-known director attached to the project, and I was working closely with the production team to ensure that the film stayed true to the original story while also appealing to a new audience. The TV option was also moving forward, with a popular streaming service expressing interest in adapting the series into a limited series. I was excited to see how these new adaptations would bring his work to a wider audience and cement his place as a literary legend."

"“Butch and I were kids going to a one-room schoolhouse before the Second World War. We grew up in a no-stoplight dirt-road town fixing cars, patching them up, playing sports and then coaching them. As men we took part in town politics and maintained the town dump—very similar jobs, now that I think about it. We hunted, we fished, we put out grassfires in the summer and plowed the town roads in the winter. Knocked over a right smart of mailboxes doing it, too. I knew","him when no one knew his name—or mine—outside of a twenty-mile radius. I should have come to see him these last years, but I was busy with my own affairs. I thought to myself, there’s time.

“Has to be a reason?” Pop asked when I finished reading him Ms. Crawford’s letter. “Is that what she’s suggesting?

But as they grew older, their paths began to diverge, and they went their separate ways, each chasing their own dreams and ambitions. Alden's friend, in particular, had always been drawn to the city, where the bright lights and fast-paced lifestyle seemed to call to him like a siren's song. He had made a name for himself as a successful businessman, but Alden knew that beneath the surface, he was still the same rugged outdoorsman at heart, always looking for a way to escape the concrete jungle and reconnect with the natural world."
"I read a review of Pop’s first book, The Lightning Storm, and the reviewer said this: “Not much happens in the","first hundred or so pages of Mr. Carmody’s suspenseful yarn, but the reader is drawn on anyway, because there are violins.”","completion, but the author's vivid descriptions of the characters' inner struggles and the atmospheric setting more than made",42,"completion, but the author's vivid descriptions of the characters' inner struggles and the atmospheric setting more than made up for the lack of plot twists, leaving the reader with a haunting sense of unease that lingered long after finishing the book, and the reviewer's criticism seemed to overlook the subtle yet powerful exploration of the human condition that Pops' writing so masterfully conveyed, a testament to the enduring power of literary fiction to capture the complexities of the human experience in all its messy, beautiful glory."
"I knew a lot of this. I learned more from Ruth Crawford herself at the Korner Koffee Kup, across the street from the Gateway Motel and just about a block down from the post office. That’s where Pop got his mail,","and there was usually a pretty damn good budget of it. I always stopped at the Koffee Kup after grabbing the post.

She had a way of gathering information, like a magnet attracting paper clips, and she would often share it with Pop, who would then pass it on to me, his eager and curious daughter. I remember the way she would smile when she told me something, her eyes twinkling with a knowing glint, as if she was sharing a secret that only she and I knew. It was as if she had a direct line to the pulse of the town, and I would sit there, mesmerized by her stories and anecdotes, feeling like I was getting a glimpse into a world that was hidden from the rest of us. And it was there, at the Korner Koffee Kup, that I first heard the rumors about the old mansion on the hill, the one that stood abandoned and mysterious, its grandeur and beauty slowly being consumed by the passing of time. People said it was haunted, that you could hear strange noises and see lights flickering in the windows, but I never believed it, not until I saw it with my own eyes, that is."

I tried to recall if I had seen her in the days leading up to her disappearance, but my memory was hazy. The dorm mom came back a few hours later with a detective, who asked me a few questions and took some notes. I was starting to get a bit worried, but the detective seemed to think it was just a routine missing person's case. He told me that the student's parents were frantic and that they were searching for her everywhere. I tried to be helpful, but I didn't have any information that could lead to her whereabouts. The detective left, and I went back to my studies, but the incident stuck with me. It was a strange and unsettling experience, and it made me realize how quickly things can spiral out of control on a college campus. I never did find out what happened to the missing student, and I often wonder what became of her. Years later, I would run into the detective again, and he would tell me that the case was never solved, but he would also mention that it was one of the most bizarre cases he had ever worked on.

He’s walking along the shoulder of a dirt road that’s been packed and oiled to keep the dust down. It’s night. A quarter moon has just risen. To Danny it looks like a sideways grin. Or a sneer. He passes a sign reading,"COUNTY ROAD F, only the O and the Y have been spraypainted over, and UCK has been crammed in to the right of the F, so the sign now reads CUNT ROAD FUCK.

He's been driving for hours, and the GPS has been leading him down these winding roads, taking him further and further away from the main highway. The trees seem to close in around him, casting long shadows that stretch across the road like skeletal fingers. He quickens his pace, his eyes fixed on the road ahead, but the darkness seems to swallow everything, making it impossible to see more than a few feet in front of him. The only sound is the crunch of gravel beneath his feet, and the distant hum of a crickets' chorus. As he rounds a bend, he catches a glimpse of a small diner in the distance, its neon sign flickering like a dying ember, beckoning him in with a promise of warmth and comfort. He can almost smell the grease and coffee wafting out into the night air, and his stomach growls in response, reminding him that he's been driving for hours without eating. He quickens his pace, his heart beating a little faster with anticipation, as he makes his way towards the diner, hoping to find a warm meal and a friendly face in this small, mysterious town."
"There’s corn on both sides of the road, not as high as an elephant’s eye but maybe four feet, suggesting it’s early summer.

In the corner, a rusty old pump sits like a sentinel, a reminder of the days when people would stop by to fill up on their way to nowhere in particular. The air is thick with the scent of decay and neglect, a heavy mist that clings to everything it touches, weighing down the atmosphere like a physical force. As Danny steps out of the shadows, the weeds seem to lean in, as if they're trying to listen to his every thought, their leaves rustling softly in the breeze like a chorus of whispers."

He remembers the countless afternoons he spent playing in the yard with his siblings, the smell of fresh-cut grass and the sound of his mother's laughter carrying on the breeze. The dog, seemingly sensing his nostalgia, lets out a low whine and Danny absently scratches its ears, a gesture that earns him a friendly nuzzle in return. As he approaches the front door, he notices the screen is slightly ajar, a small crack in the otherwise sturdy frame, and he frowns, wondering if he'd forgotten to close it when he left for his walk earlier that morning.

On Saturday morning he packs his dinnerbucket with a couple of sandwiches and a piece of the cake Becky brought over after he wired up the tailpipe of her old Honda Civic.

As he drives away, he can't help but think about the upcoming weekend, when he's planning to take his girlfriend, Sarah, on a surprise picnic in the nearby park, and he's been trying to come up with the perfect picnic basket to impress her. He's been racking his brain for ideas, but nothing seems quite right, and he's starting to get a little anxious about it. He glances at his watch and sees that he's running a bit behind schedule, so he focuses on the road ahead and the tasks waiting for him at the Johnson's house."
"The GPS on his phone gets him to Gunnel by ten-thirty. The day is all Kansas, hot and bright and clear and not very interesting. The town is nothing but a grocery store, a farm supply store, a café, and a rusty water tower with GUNNEL","on the side. Ten minutes after leaving it, he comes to County Road F and turns onto it. It’s tar, not packed dirt. Nevertheless his stomach is tight and his heart is beating hard enough so he can feel it in his neck and his temples.","The landscape stretches out endlessly, a sea of golden wheat and cornfields that seem to go on forever.

The air is thick with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers and the distant hum of a lone cicada provides a soothing background melody. As he steps out of the car, the warm sun beats down on his skin, a stark contrast to the air-conditioned comfort of his vehicle. He takes a deep breath, feeling the dry air fill his lungs, and gazes out at the seemingly endless expanse of rural America. The town of Gunnel, it seems, is a place where time stands still, where the pace of life is slow and the people are friendly. He can almost smell the freshly brewed coffee wafting from the café, and his stomach growls in anticipation of a hearty breakfast. As he walks towards the café, he notices a group of locals gathered outside, chatting and laughing together, their faces weathered from years of working outdoors. They nod in greeting as he approaches, their eyes squinting slightly in the bright sunlight. He orders a cup of coffee and a plate of eggs, and takes a seat at the counter, feeling a sense of contentment wash over him as he surveys the simple, uncomplicated beauty of this small town."

I sat down across from him, sipping my coffee and trying to appear nonchalant, but my mind was racing with questions about what we were doing here and what we might find. The dim lighting and the musty smell of the old building only added to the sense of unease that had been building up inside me since we arrived. I glanced at Pelley, who was still sitting there, his eyes fixed on something across the room, his expression unreadable behind the mask. I wondered what he was thinking, and whether he had any idea what we were getting ourselves into."
