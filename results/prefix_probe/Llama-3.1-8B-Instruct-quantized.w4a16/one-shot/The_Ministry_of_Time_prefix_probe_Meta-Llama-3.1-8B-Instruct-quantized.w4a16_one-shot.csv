"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking. Lacerations too, from a Taser—he’d shot at two of the team members who’d come to expatriate him, and a third was forced to fire.","their bodies had been returned to the twenty-first century, but the remaining five were still struggling to adapt to the vastly different environment.

Graham's memories of his life in the past were hazy, but he vaguely recalled being a skilled naval officer, serving under the command of a seasoned admiral. The memories of his time in the twenty-first century were fragmented, but he remembered the sensation of being in a hospital bed, surrounded by beeping machines and sterile white walls. He tried to piece together the events that had led him to this strange new world, but his mind was a jumble of disjointed images and half-remembered conversations. The other expats seemed to be experiencing similar difficulties, and the group's leader, a woman named Sarah, had taken it upon herself to try and help them adjust to their new reality. She had been a historian, and her knowledge of the past seemed to be helping her navigate the complexities of this new world. Graham was grateful for her guidance, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more to their situation than met the eye. As he lay in his bed, he couldn't help but wonder what other secrets lay hidden beneath the surface of this strange new world."
"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into","his eighties.

The interior was a labyrinth of cramped corridors and drab, beige-colored offices, each one filled with rows of dusty filing cabinets and the faint scent of stale air. It was a far cry from the grand, sweeping architecture of the Ministry's central headquarters, but it served its purpose as a humble outpost for the local authorities. Gore, however, was not here to admire the décor. He had a mission to complete, and he was running out of time."

"All this was to come. On that first morning, there was Gore chain-smoking and a bleeding water-supply line. The","toilet’s cistern lay on the floor, gleaming like a slain whale.

"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer. I’m sure he knew plenty about ship’s rigging, but he’d probably never handled an instrument more technologically complex than a sextant.

Gore's fascination with the old sailing ships was no exception, and as he stood on the deck, he couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the intricate network of ropes, pulleys, and masts that seemed to stretch on forever. The salty sea air filled his lungs, and the cries of the gulls overhead only added to the sense of excitement that had been building inside him for weeks. He had always been drawn to the sea, and now, as he gazed out at the endless expanse of blue, he felt a sense of restlessness, a feeling that there was something out there waiting for him, something that only the sea could provide."
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people. Hunting was out of the question, and socializing was limited by order of the Ministry. By the end of the first week he was visibly going bonkers with no one but me to talk to.","reading widely, from Shakespeare to Dickens, and had even dabbled in writing his own poetry, which, though not always polished, showed a deep understanding of the human condition.

His love for nature was evident in the way he spoke about the beauty of a sunrise or the tranquility of a forest glade, and his passion for music was contagious, often drawing others into the circle to join in a lively rendition of a folk tune. Despite his many talents, however, it was his kindness and empathy that truly set him apart, a quality that made everyone feel seen and heard in his presence, and which I found myself drawn to more and more as I got to know him better."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea.

He would see the beauty in the mundane, the poetry in the everyday, and the stories that lay hidden beneath the surface of the bustling streets. And yet, despite his fascination with the world around him, he remained detached, a man out of time, forever stuck in his own era, yet simultaneously observing the world with a sense of wonder and awe. His thoughts would often drift back to the sea, to the vast expanse of the ocean, and the endless possibilities that lay beyond the horizon. He would ponder the mysteries of the deep, the secrets that lay hidden beneath the waves, and the stories of the sailors who had braved the unknown. His mind would wander to the far-off lands he had visited, the strange customs he had encountered, and the people he had met along the way. And as he stood there, frozen in time, he would feel a sense of longing, a yearning for a world that was rapidly disappearing, a world that he could never truly be a part of. His gaze would linger on the people around him, the way they lived their lives, the way they interacted with one another, and the way they navigated the complexities of the modern world. He would see the good, the bad, and the ugly, and he would wonder what the future held for humanity, and whether the world would ever be able to reconcile its past, present, and future."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to. He’d made, as people do, an assumption about me that left me room to maneuver. Later, when he found out the truth—as","people do—he’d be unbalanced by his own mistake. Another person’s unguardedness in that moment can be very useful, interpersonally, as long as you don’t soften.

But as I looked into his eyes, I saw a glimmer of something else - a hint of curiosity, a spark of intrigue.

"Graham used other words too, not wrong, exactly, but not right, like “your people,” or “your culture.” When I said, in a wincingly tight voice, that we had the same people and culture, he replied, mildly, “But I don’t think that we do.” Then came the image searches about Cambodia, on food and dress","and customs.

"It’s surprising, then, that I allowed Graham’s drawing of the projection device to enter my files as a joke, like a coin minted 70 BC.

It was then that I realized, perhaps Graham had been onto something, and his drawing was more than just a joke, but a glimpse into a future that was yet to be realized."
"By the start of that summer, Graham was practically a native of the era. He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle. Most mornings he rose—hours before me—and",went for a run. He would sometimes wake me up with a juicy smoker’s wheeze on his return to the house.

He would then spend a quiet hour reading the newspaper or checking his phone for any important updates before heading out to tackle the day's tasks, which often included working on his latest project, a novel that he had been writing in his spare time. As he sat at his desk, the sound of the city outside began to stir, and the hum of the washing machine in the background provided a soothing background noise, a reminder of the mundane yet comforting rhythms of everyday life. Despite his efforts to blend in with the era, Graham couldn't shake off the feeling that he was an outsider, a time traveler who had stumbled upon a world that was both familiar and yet, utterly foreign. He often found himself wondering how he had ended up here, in this strange and wondrous place, and what the future held for him."
"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past. I was prickly and defensive about","this; I could not look at why directly. I heard the way I spoke to him about it: adjustment, reasonable, citizen, responsibility, values. He blew a lot of pensive cigarette smoke at me.","his own identity, and the more he struggled to reconcile the old with the new, the more he felt like a relic from a bygone era, a man out of time, lost in a world that was rapidly leaving",65,"his own identity, and the more he struggled to reconcile the old with the new, the more he felt like a relic from a bygone era, a man out of time, lost in a world that was rapidly leaving him behind.

As he navigated the complexities of modern life, he found himself torn between the comfort of familiarity and the thrill of discovery, his heart heavy with the weight of his own contradictions."
"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them. Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled","to focus on the tests—eyes moving rapidly. I once found him the sole occupant of the fifth-floor smoking area (a pigeon-shit-encrusted balcony), methodically shredding a filter of a finished cigarette. I watched him for a while, interested in the way that only his fingers moved. Most people ripple with surplus motion unless they are concentrating, but Graham only ever moved the parts of him that he wanted to move.","The researchers were at a loss for how to proceed, but they couldn't afford to give up.

They decided to modify the testing environment to make it less reminiscent of the Ministry's notorious hospital wards. They replaced the cold, sterile booths with more comfortable and homey settings, complete with soft lighting and calming music. However, this change had an unexpected effect - the expats began to feel too comfortable, and their anxiety reactions became even more muted. The researchers were faced with a new dilemma: how to elicit a genuine emotional response from the expats without triggering their anxiety. They tried various combinations of stimuli, from gentle, soothing sounds to more intense, disturbing images, but nothing seemed to work. It wasn't until they introduced a new variable - the presence of a familiar face - that they began to see some promising results. The expats' reactions became more intense and varied, and the researchers were finally able to gather some useful data. But as they delved deeper into the results, they began to realize that the presence of a familiar face was not just a simple variable - it was a complex and multifaceted factor that could have far-reaching implications for their research and its applications."
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too. Even Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had","fought in large-scale battles, were laid out by the ultramodern scope of the harm.

They decided to take a break and regroup, hoping to find a new approach that would yield more accurate results without causing unnecessary distress. In the meantime, they began to question the true purpose of the empathy exams and whether they were truly effective in measuring empathy, or just a cruel exercise in emotional manipulation."

The aroma of roasted vegetables and grilled meats wafted through the air, making my stomach growl with hunger. I finally settled on a plate of chicken and vegetables, and as I took a seat at an empty table, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease, as if I didn't quite belong in this world of suits and ties."

Graham's eyes wandered to the nearby garden, where a young girl was busy watering the plants with a gentle touch, her ponytail bobbing up and down as she worked.

"Graham put down his mug.

"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders. The bridges kept turning in their core reports, and the experiments kept running.

Every day I had to record his heart rate, his blood pressure, his temperature; every day a written record of what he wore, what he ate, how much","exercise he took; every week checking progress against the imaginary benchmarks set by Control, use of phone, use of transport, use of media and the assessment of how harmful or useful each medium was; all the time the corrective tests for vocabulary and habit; novelistic observations on his character and temperament.

But I couldn't help but feel that we were being used for something much bigger than we were being told. The more I thought about it, the more I became convinced that we were just pawns in a much larger game. And then, one day, I stumbled upon a cryptic message in the lab's logbook that made my blood run cold. It was a single sentence, scribbled in the margin of a page: ""The subject is not what he seems."" I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized that I had been so focused on the data collection that I had never really looked at the subject himself. What if he wasn't just a test subject, but something more? Something that could change the course of human history? The thought sent my mind reeling, and I knew that I had to get to the bottom of the truth."
"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events. He’d lain motionless in the garden for two hours, on","a wet and putrid night, to shoot a fox, and pulled out one of his own rotting teeth (he showed it to me afterward; it was the color of a tombstone, caped with gelatinous red)—was this Victorian, or was this “irregularities”?","that warm summer afternoon, the sun beating down relentlessly on his weathered face, his eyes fixed on some point in the distance, his mind seemingly a thousand miles away.

The air was heavy with the scent of blooming flowers and the distant chirping of birds, but Graham's expression remained as impassive as the stone bench he sat on. I had grown accustomed to his quirks over the years, but this level of stillness was unsettling, and I found myself wondering if he was okay. His wife, Margaret, had been acting strangely too, her usual warmth and kindness replaced by a distant, almost detached air, and I couldn't help but wonder if there was something going on that we didn't know about. As I sat there, watching Graham, I noticed the way the sunlight danced across his face, highlighting the deep lines etched into his skin, and for a moment, I felt a pang of concern for this man who had become like a father to me. But as the minutes ticked by, Graham's gaze remained fixed, his expression unchanging, and I began to feel a sense of unease, as if something was building, something that would soon come to a head."
"So I was anxious about Graham’s disdain for the twenty-first century, because never mind that I felt rejected by it, I was worried that the universe would feel the atemporal sting of his contempt and take","him away.

"I persuaded Graham to use the tiny office, in which I ordinarily worked, to cram for the test.

"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century.

"It paid off in the early autumn. When I came down for breakfast one morning, I found","Graham at the counter with a dictionary and a tin of protein powder, performing exegesis on the label.","that the atmosphere in the house was tense, with my mother sitting at the table, staring at a letter in",35,"that the atmosphere in the house was tense, with my mother sitting at the table, staring at a letter in her hand, her face pale and her eyes red-rimmed from crying, and my father standing by the window, his back to us, his shoulders shaking as he tried to compose himself, and I could sense that something was terribly wrong, and I felt a knot form in my stomach as I wondered what could have caused such a reaction, and I tried to remember the last time I had seen my parents like this, but my mind was a blank, and I felt a sense of unease wash over me as I realized that whatever was wrong, it must be serious, and I took a deep breath and tried to prepare myself for the worst, and my mother looked up at me and saw the concern etched on my face, and she quickly wiped her tears away and tried to put on a brave face, but I could see the fear and worry lurking beneath the surface, and I knew that whatever was happening, it was going to change our lives forever."

"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs. Given the prevalence of prostitution in Victorian England, the nonexistence of reliable barrier contraception in his era, and the fact that he was a sailor, this suggested he was either a virgin or very lucky. But then again, I knew enough about his biography to know that he was very, very lucky.","of the Ministry's internal memo on Graham's psychological profile, which included a section on his views on intimacy, but it only mentioned that he believed it was a ""frivolous indulgence"" and that he preferred to focus on his work.

I had also tried to bring up the subject with him directly, but he would change the subject or become evasive, leaving me with more questions than answers. It was as if he had built a wall around himself, and I wasn't sure if I'd ever be able to breach it. The tension between us was palpable, and I couldn't help but wonder if I was the only one who felt it. I tried to focus on my work, but my mind kept wandering back to Graham and the enigma that was his relationship with intimacy. I began to feel like I was walking on eggshells around him, never knowing when he might lash out or retreat into his shell. It was a delicate balancing act, and I wasn't sure how much longer I could keep it up. The more I tried to navigate this minefield, the more I felt like I was losing my footing. I started to question whether it was even worth it, or if I should just accept that some people were beyond understanding. But something about Graham's reserved nature drew me in, and I found myself wanting to know more, even if it meant risking getting hurt. I couldn't help but feel that there was more to him than met the eye, and I was determined to uncover it, no matter what it took."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory. Every time I gave Graham a book, I was trying to shunt him along a story I’d been telling myself all my life.","something about her that made me pause, a quiet confidence that seemed to emanate from within, a sense that she was not just a blank slate, but a canvas waiting to be filled with the vibrant colors of experience and understanding.

Her eyes sparkled with a hint of mischief, a glint that suggested she was not just a passive recipient of information, but an active participant in the conversation, a partner in the dance of discovery. As I looked deeper, I saw the faint lines of a story etched on her face, a topography of laughter and tears, of triumphs and setbacks, of a life lived fully and authentically. And in that moment, I felt a pang of curiosity, a desire to know more about this enigmatic woman, to peel back the layers of her personality and uncover the complexities that lay beneath the surface."
Graham was adamant about not informing the Ministry about his illness. It was the closest I had,ever seen him to entreating. I thought about it a lot. I liked being entreated by him.,"seen him show such a strong sense of determination, and I couldn't help but wonder what",34,"seen him show such a strong sense of determination, and I couldn't help but wonder what was really going on behind those stoic eyes of his. His words echoed in my mind as I watched him walk away, his long strides devouring the distance between us, leaving me with more questions than answers. The Ministry's rules were clear: any sign of weakness was a liability, and Graham knew it as well as I did. But what if this was more than just a simple illness? What if it was something deeper, something that could compromise the entire operation? I knew I had to tread carefully, but my curiosity was getting the better of me."
"You’re angry, maybe, that I could have been this callow. You think you would have seized the lever here, swung the tram over the empty track instead of toward the row of bound prisoners. You ask me why I wasn’t more suspicious. But naturally I was suspicious. Adela was shifting, elusive—her very face was inconsistent. Her reasons were bad,","half-veiled. Then again, whose upper management am I not describing? Who trusts their workplace? Who thinks their job is on the side of right? They fed us all poison from a bottle marked “prestige,” and we developed a high tolerance for bitterness.

The thought still haunts me, and I'm left wondering what could have been if only I had seen through her deception. The tram's wheels screeched as it rounded the bend, and I felt a jolt of adrenaline as I realized the gravity of my mistake. I should have been more cautious, more vigilant. But I was too caught up in the moment, too blinded by my emotions. And now, I'm left to pick up the pieces of a shattered trust, wondering how I could have been so foolish."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.","that I had managed to get my hands on the ancient artifact, and what exactly it was supposed to do, as he",39,"that I had managed to get my hands on the ancient artifact, and what exactly it was supposed to do, as he leaned back in his chair, his eyes fixed intently on me, his expression a mix of curiosity and skepticism, and I could tell he was trying to gauge my credibility, but I just shrugged and said it was a long story, one that would take a while to explain, and he nodded, his eyes never leaving mine, as if he was trying to read my thoughts, and I felt a shiver run down my spine, as I realized that he was not just asking out of curiosity, but also out of a sense of unease, as if he knew that this artifact was more than just a simple relic, but a key to unlocking a much larger mystery, one that could potentially change the course of history, and I knew that I had to tread carefully, as I began to explain the story of how I had acquired the artifact, and the strange occurrences that had been happening since I had gotten it, and I could see the wheels turning in his head, as he tried to piece together the puzzle, and I knew that I had to be careful, as I was not sure how much I could trust him, and I was not sure what his true intentions were, but I knew that I had to take a chance, as I had a feeling that he was the only one who could help me uncover the truth, and I took a deep breath, and began to tell him the story, hoping that he would believe me, and that together, we could uncover the secrets of the artifact, and change the course of history."
One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop. He no longer needed several minutes to find the letter “M,” but he typed with his index fingers alone, pecking out sentences.","his fingers, staring out the window with an air of deep contemplation.

The aroma of roasted vegetables wafted from the kitchen, mingling with the scent of burning wood from the fireplace, creating a cozy atmosphere that seemed to envelop the entire house. I hung my coat on the hook by the door and walked towards the table, noticing that Graham's eyes were fixed on something outside, his expression unreadable. I followed his gaze and saw a figure walking up the path towards the house, their features illuminated by the fading light of day. My heart skipped a beat as I wondered who it could be, and why they were visiting at this late hour. I cleared my throat to announce my presence, and Graham's eyes snapped back to mine, a hint of a smile playing on his lips."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers. He took in anecdotes about my childhood meals as if they would contribute to a portrait of a whole woman. He ignored the fact that mostly I cooked assorted chicken pieces on rice. I could tell him things about galangal, and he found that very profound.","that seemed to hold secrets of the cosmos, his pencil scratching furiously as he tried to capture the essence of the unknown.

His fascination with Southeast Asian cuisine was not just about the taste, but the stories behind each dish, the way the aromas transported him to a different world. He would often spend hours in the kitchen, experimenting with new recipes, his eyes lighting up with excitement as he discovered the perfect balance of flavors. His interest in my mother's cooking was not just about the food itself, but the love and care that went into preparing each meal, the way the flavors seemed to dance on the palate. As he cooked, he would talk to me about his own childhood, about the meals his mother used to make for him, and the way food brought people together. His passion for Southeast Asian food was not just about the food, but about the culture, the people, and the stories behind it. And as I watched him cook, I realized that his interest in my mother's cooking was not just about the food, but about the connection it brought us, a connection that transcended borders and cultures, a connection that spoke to something deeper and more meaningful."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization. I wanted him in a role that didn’t require him to be at sea for months, possibly years,","at a time. It was too soon, I told myself. Whatever Adela said, he wasn’t ready, he’d barely left London, let alone land. But I wanted him to stay for other reasons too. It was humiliating to know that about myself and to say nothing into his implacable placidity.","at all, and I was worried about the toll it would take on our relationship.

He had always been a sailor at heart, and the thought of him giving up his career was difficult for him to accept. I, on the other hand, had grown accustomed to the comforts of a stable routine and the idea of him being away from me for extended periods of time was unbearable. We spent many sleepless nights discussing our options, weighing the pros and cons of each possibility, and trying to find a middle ground that would satisfy both of our needs. The navy's offer of a desk job was a compromise, but it wasn't enough to ease my concerns, and I knew that I had to be honest with him about my feelings. I took a deep breath and expressed my worries, hoping that he would understand my perspective and find a way to make it work, but I was prepared for the possibility that he might not be willing to give up his dream of serving in the navy."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.","The song's upbeat tempo and catchy melody seemed to clash with the somber mood that had settled over the group, but Graham's enthusiasm was infectious, and soon everyone was tapping their feet",64,"The song's upbeat tempo and catchy melody seemed to clash with the somber mood that had settled over the group, but Graham's enthusiasm was infectious, and soon everyone was tapping their feet along with the music."
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes.

I envisioned the look on my superior's face when I presented him with the evidence, the stern expression that would turn into a mixture of horror and disappointment, and the inevitable reprimand that would follow, leaving me to wonder if I'd been too hasty in my judgment, if there was more to Graham's online activities than met the eye, and if I'd been too quick to jump to conclusions, like a detective who'd solved the case before gathering all the facts, leaving me to ponder the what-ifs and maybes that would haunt me for days to come."
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing,","as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday.

The sound of raindrops hitting the pavement created a soothing melody, but it was soon drowned out by the cacophony of voices and the rumble of the trucks that continued to arrive with more supplies. The council's emergency services were doing their best to keep everyone safe, but it was clear that the situation was far from under control. As I made my way through the crowds, I noticed a group of volunteers, armed with shovels and sandbags, trying to divert the water away from the nearby shops.
