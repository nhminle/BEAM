I [29m] have been friends with Chad [32m] since we were born.

We would spend hours playing in the backyard, exploring the woods behind our houses, and having sleepovers that lasted until the early hours of the morning. Our moms would often joke that we were more like brothers than just best friends, and as we grew older, that statement only became more true. We would go to each other's sports games, school events, and family gatherings, always making sure to sit together and support one another. Chad was more than just a friend to me; he was my partner in crime, my confidant, and my brother."
"Anyway, forward to five months ago. I dated Hope [28f] for a few weeks. Not a big deal. We decided we weren’t feeling it, no chemistry, so we called it quits. And then lo and behold she hits","it off with Chad. Of course in true Good Luck Charm fashion, this means Chad is her soulmate.

I was hesitant at first, but she seemed genuinely remorseful and willing to work through our issues. We started talking again, and I have to admit, it felt like no time had passed at all. We met up for coffee, and it was like we picked up right where we left off. She seemed more self-aware and introspective, acknowledging her past mistakes and taking responsibility for her actions. I was impressed by her growth and willingness to learn from her past experiences. As we sat there sipping our coffee, I couldn't help but wonder if maybe, just maybe, we had a second chance at something real. But little did I know, this was only the beginning of a rollercoaster ride of emotions, as we navigated the complexities of our rekindled relationship."
"The only problem is that Chad has six more months on our lease but found a perfect new house for him and Hope, and he can’t afford to pay rent on two places at the same",time. So he had to make the difficult decision to screw me over or screw her over—and he picked me.

"I’m annoyed, but I decided to try to find a reason to spend more time outside so I don’t have to stare out my window. I’ve always wanted a dog, but Chad would never agree to it. So I went to a rescue and found the ugliest animal there. The one so hideous, nobody else wanted it. This dog’s got an underbite and mange, and he’s missing half an","ear. He’s a little Brussels Griffon, so he’s got that deep frown—he looks like a judgmental gremlin. I adopted him and named him Chad since the dog is now my new best friend. If you’re reading this, you’re dead to me, human Chad. (Not really, I still love the guy.) But I tag him in the captions of every Chad the Dog Instagram post with “Look, a loyal Chad!”","ear, but there was something about him that tugged at my heartstrings.

Chad was not happy about it, but I convinced him to give him a chance. We named him Brutus, and at first, he was a handful. He would chew on anything he could get his teeth on, and he would bark nonstop whenever he saw another dog. But as the days went by, he started to settle in, and we grew to love him. He became a part of the family, and we couldn't imagine life without him. Despite his appearance, he was a sweet and loving companion, and we were grateful to have him in our lives. As I looked at him now, I realized that sometimes the things that are considered ugly or unwanted can end up being the most beautiful and precious things of all."
I tilted my head so my braid fell to one side and held up four fingers. Maddy,"didn’t look happy, but she took the picture with my phone, then handed it back to me.","was about to count along, but I stopped her, and instead, I asked if she knew what the",34,"was about to count along, but I stopped her, and instead, I asked if she knew what the significance of the number four was in our secret language."
"“That dog trusts him,” Maddy said. “And that’s a rescue dog, so that means something. They’re usually all","skittish and freaked out.” She went quiet again looking at his wall. “Go down further,” Maddy said. “The billboard.”","very wary of people, but this one seems to have taken a liking to him.

It's almost as if they've formed a bond, which is quite unusual for a rescue dog. Perhaps it's because he's been with him for a while now, and the dog has grown accustomed to his presence and routine. Whatever the reason, it's clear that the dog trusts him implicitly, and that's a testament to his kind and gentle nature."
That night after work Maddy made dinner. Grilled portobello mushrooms and rice pilaf. I did,"the dishes and cleaned the kitchen, then took a shower and blew out my hair.","not eat much, but the aroma of the food wafted through the entire apartment,",30,"not eat much, but the aroma of the food wafted through the entire apartment, enticing me to try a small portion, and as I sat down at the table, Maddy handed me a glass of freshly squeezed lemonade, its citrusy flavor a perfect complement to the earthy taste of the mushrooms."

My best friend was in a Hawaiian shirt and pink cargo shorts. He was a general manager at Trader Joe’s. I missed not having to go to the grocery store now,"that he had moved out. Actually, I missed a lot of things now that Brad had moved out. Like having another human to talk to, even if it was this one.","that I could just order everything online and have it delivered to my doorstep, but sometimes I still found myself wandering through the aisles, reminiscing",62,"that I could just order everything online and have it delivered to my doorstep, but sometimes I still found myself wandering through the aisles, reminiscing about the good old days when we would browse the shelves together, comparing the different types of exotic spices and cheeses, and laughing at the quirky product names."

They were starting to do the couples thing for all the trips and birthdays. They were all going up,"to Lutsen in October to go hiking. They asked me if I wanted to go, but I didn’t. Not alone.","in the elevator, laughing and joking, holding hands, and taking the perfect Instagram-worthy",39,"in the elevator, laughing and joking, holding hands, and taking the perfect Instagram-worthy photos together, but deep down, they were struggling to find their true selves amidst the facade of a perfect relationship."
Brad took a swallow of his drink. “Ask that nurse out. Go,"wherever she is. Pitch the idea to her, she might be into it.”","on your instincts, and see where it takes you.

You never know what could be waiting for you on the other side of that conversation."
"“Yeah,” Brad said. “She dates you, you guys break up, and she rides happily into the sunset too. It’s a win-win. Seriously.

Brad looked me in the eye. “You will never find someone as long as all the women you date aren’t actually meant for you. You’re not their,soulmate. Their soulmate is the person they meet after you.

"I had actually thought about her. I’d checked once or twice to see if she’d messaged me again. She hadn’t. The last message was me telling her it was nice chatting with her, three days ago. Trying to keep talking to her was a dead end if she","lived somewhere else. But I don’t know. Maybe Brad had a point. What could it hurt to try?

Maybe it was the way she laughed at my jokes or the way she spoke about her favorite books. Whatever it was, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd missed out on something special. I decided to move on and focus on other things, but the memory of her lingered in the back of my mind. It wasn't until a few days later, when I was scrolling through social media, that I stumbled upon a post from her. It was a picture of her with a big smile on her face, and a caption that read ""new chapter."" I couldn't help but wonder what that chapter was about, and whether she was thinking of me at all. The thought sent a pang of curiosity through me, and I found myself wondering if I should reach out to her again. But I pushed the thought aside, telling myself that I'd made the right decision in moving on. Still, the question lingered: what if I'd been too quick to give up?"

Me: Not sure yet. I live with my best friend Maddy and we alternate who chooses,"where we’ll go next.

"For a moment I debated calling from a blocked number. He was nice, but I still didn’t know him. But I figured it",was just as easy to block him later if he got creepy.

“But what if it isn’t? I’m just playing devil’s advocate here. What if it isn’t? Brad said that everyone I’m serious enough to date more than twice is cosmically destined for someone else.” He went quiet for,"a beat. “Does nobody feel right to you? Like, there’s just enough there to give it a little go, but then the bottom falls out? Is that just me?

The thought sent a shiver down my spine as I gazed into the eyes of the person sitting across from me, trying to read their expression. Was I just a placeholder, a temporary fix until they found the one they were meant to be with? The idea was unsettling, to say the least. I pushed the thought aside, trying to focus on the conversation at hand, but it lingered in the back of my mind, refusing to be silenced. As we continued to talk, I couldn't help but feel like I was just going through the motions, pretending to be interested in getting to know this person, when in reality, I was just waiting for the inevitable – the moment they would realize they weren't the one for me, and I would be left to pick up the pieces of my shattered heart."

So, yeah, I'm willing to bet he just forgot or something, but it's still not cool to leave someone else to pick up the tab. I'm going to go talk to him about it, see what he has to say for himself."

It wasn't until the police showed up at my doorstep, asking questions, that I realized something was really wrong. They told me they'd found her car abandoned on the outskirts of town, the engine still running, the headlights shining into the darkness. It was then that I knew I had to take action, to do something I'd never done before: I had to go looking for her."

As we walked out of the school building, the warm sun hit our faces, and the smell of freshly cut grass filled the air, transporting us back to carefree summer days spent playing in the backyard, riding our bikes, and exploring the neighborhood. My brother and I exchanged a look, both of us thinking the same thing - the summer was over, and it was time to get back to reality."

The room seemed to be a mix of old and new, with the familiar furniture still present, but now surrounded by these modern touches that seemed to be a deliberate attempt to update the space. I couldn't help but wonder who had made these changes and why."
Maddy looked up. Then her eyes dropped to the laptop I was holding and she somehow immediately,"knew what was about to happen. “No.” She shook her head. “No. No, no, no, no, no.

"As we started pulling our bags from the trunk, a brown-haired middle-aged woman came out of",the side of the three-car garage. “Are you Emma?” she said in a thick Mexican accent.,"The woman, dressed in a faded floral dress, looked at us with a mixture of curiosity and",32,"The woman, dressed in a faded floral dress, looked at us with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion, her eyes scanning our group as if trying to place us, and then she approached us, her hands grasping a worn-out shopping basket, and asked in a low, gravelly voice, ""Can I help you young people with something?"""

We lugged our bags up the stairs and were sweating by the time we made it to the door. We came in through a screened-in porch that overlooked the lake. Maddy and,I shared a glance. It was adorable. White wicker rocking chairs and a small matching loveseat with thick floral cushions. A cute coffee table and plastic ferns in wrought-iron planters and hanging baskets.,"The air was thick with the scent of blooming flowers and the sound of birds chirping filled the air as we stepped inside, our eyes adjusting to the dim light after the bright sunlight.

The interior of the cabin was cozy and rustic, with wooden beams and a large stone fireplace that seemed to be the focal point of the room. Maddy and I dropped our bags on the floor and made our way over to the window, where we gazed out at the serene lake below, the water's surface reflecting the vibrant colors of the surrounding trees. The tranquility of the scene was a stark contrast to the chaos we had left behind, and for a moment, we just stood there, taking it all in, the only sound being the gentle lapping of the water against the shore."
"The bedrooms were off the living room on either side of a short hallway with a single bathroom shared in the middle. The bathroom had a white claw-foot tub, pale blue","tile, and an old pedestal sink. I took the room with the cushioned reading nook in the window and Maddy picked the one with the hanging swing chair in the corner.","The walls were painted a soft cream color, and the window above the tub let in a warm, natural light that seemed to highlight the subtle imperfections in the old tile.",62,"The walls were painted a soft cream color, and the window above the tub let in a warm, natural light that seemed to highlight the subtle imperfections in the old tile.

The furniture was a mix of old and new, with a vintage armchair sitting beside a sleek, low-profile sofa. A large window at the far end of the room let in a stunning view of the surrounding countryside, and a built-in bookshelf filled with a collection of classic novels and well-loved paperbacks."
"Four hours later, Maddy and I were back at the cottage sitting in the screened-in porch.",We’d had dinner in town and then boated back.

She looked away from me. “Emma…” Her eyes came back to mine. “Please. Please do it.,Do it now before you lose the chance to meet them altogether.

"“How about this,” Maddy said. “Run your DNA and make your account private. We’ll change your privacy settings for a few minutes, poke around. If you have any","relatives out there, we’ll screenshot it and go back to private.

I'm sure they're not going to be happy about this, so let's keep it on the down low, okay? We can use my laptop in the library, it's the safest place to be. But first, we need to make sure we're not being watched, so let's take a quick look around the room to make sure we're alone. I'll go check the other side of the library, you check this side, and if we don't see anyone, we can start the process. Sound good?"
We prioritized power for the coffee maker first and we brewed a pot while I sat in the kitchen with,"a towel wrapped around my head. When it was done, Maddy poured me a cup and handed it to me.","my eyes fixed on the clock, watching the seconds tick by as the aroma of freshly ground coffee",40,"my eyes fixed on the clock, watching the seconds tick by as the aroma of freshly ground coffee filled the air, and the sound of the brewer's gurgling water and spinning blades created a soothing background melody that seemed to calm my nerves, but my mind was elsewhere, preoccupied with the upcoming meeting and the weight of the decision that lay ahead, as I sipped on the hot coffee that would soon become my lifeline, a bitter yet invigorating elixir that would help me face the challenges that awaited me, and I couldn't help but wonder if I was truly prepared for what was to come, or if I was just going through the motions, a mere automaton, a robot programmed to perform, but lacking the spark of true conviction, the fire that drives us to take risks, to push beyond the boundaries of what is safe and familiar, to explore the unknown, to discover new horizons, to create something new, something innovative, something that would leave a lasting impact, a mark that would be remembered long after I was gone, a legacy that would outlast me, a testament to my existence, a reminder that I was here, that I lived, that I breathed, that I felt, that I loved, that I lost, that I learned, that I grew, that I changed, that I evolved, that I adapted, that I overcame, that I persevered, that I triumphed, that I failed, that I learned from my mistakes, that I rose from the ashes, that I was reborn, that I was renewed, that I was revitalized, that I was rejuvenated, that I was reinvigorated, that I was reenergized, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekindled, that I was rekind"

"When we were safely away from anything we could crash into, Maddy killed the engine and slumped in the captain’s","seat. “If we’d been on the other side of the dock, we could have hit the yacht,” she said, looking shaken.","chair, letting out a deep sigh of relief as the silence that followed was a stark contrast to the chaos we",41,"chair, letting out a deep sigh of relief as the silence that followed was a stark contrast to the chaos we had just escaped, the adrenaline still coursing through our veins as we gazed out at the endless expanse of water stretching out before us, the sun beginning to set in the distance, casting a golden glow over the scene, and for a moment, it felt like we were the only two people in the world, the only sound being the gentle lapping of the waves against the hull of the boat."
"I lined the nose of the boat up with the side of the dock and started for it again, only this time I killed the thrust earlier.

The dock itself was old and weathered, with splintered wood and rusty chains, but it held steady as I secured the boat. I took a moment to catch my breath and assess the situation, trying to remember the last time I'd been on this dock and what I'd been doing here. The memories were hazy, but I knew I'd been working on the boat, probably doing some repairs or maintenance. I looked around, taking in the surroundings, and noticed that the dock was surrounded by a small cove, with steep cliffs rising up on either side. The water was a deep blue, almost purple in the fading light of day, and I could see a few seagulls flying overhead, their cries carrying on the wind. I felt a sense of unease wash over me, but I pushed it aside and focused on the task at hand."
"Her phone rang. “Oh, hold on. I have to leave my ringer on in case Maddy gets in trouble trying to get back.” She looked at it. “It’s her.” She swiped and put the",phone to her ear. “Maddy?

She glanced at the clock on the wall, wondering how much longer she'd have to wait for Maddy's call back. The minutes ticked by at a glacial pace, each one feeling like an eternity as she tried to focus on her work, but her mind kept wandering back to her little sister. She couldn't help but think about all the worst-case scenarios that could be playing out, and her anxiety began to spike. Just as she was starting to get really worked up, her phone rang again, and she hesitated for a moment before answering it, her voice a little shaky as she said, ""Hey, Maddy, I thought you just called me?"" There was a pause on the other end of the line, and for a moment, she wondered if she'd lost the connection. But then a voice spoke up, and it wasn't Maddy's. It was a deep, unfamiliar voice that sent a shiver down her spine."
I hadn’t really cared too much that Benny might not be here today. He wasn’t the point of this visit. But all that,had changed in the last ten minutes.

Then, in a tone that was almost too casual, she said, ""It's just that...I think we need to talk in person. Can you meet me at the coffee shop on 5th and Main?"" Her words hung in the air, leaving her friend with a sense of unease and a growing feeling that something was very wrong."
“I hope so. It’s been a little stressful.” She picked up Murder Mittens. “I don’t think I really thought this island thing through. It,"sounded like a good idea at the time but it’s kind of inconvenient. Anyway, it’s only for six weeks and Maddy likes the cottage, so…”","was going to be as simple as I thought it would be.

Maddy was already off the pontoon and running toward me across the beach.

"Amber was in a flowing white-and-peach chiffon summer dress with a slit up the thigh. Her long brown hair was down, she had on a floppy wide-brimmed hat and huge sunglasses.

I also picked up some pastries and sandwiches from the bakery down the street, and I even found this adorable little bookstore that I think you'd love. I ended up buying a few books for myself, but I also got you a few that I think you'll really enjoy. I was thinking we could have a little picnic in the park and try out all the goodies I brought. What do you think? Is that something you'd like to do this weekend?"

I watched him walk to the beach and I let out a long breath. Maddy was right.,"This was bad. Mom never left anywhere on good terms. Not jobs, or apartments, or relationships. Especially relationships.","she had been telling me that he needed some time to clear his head, and now I could see why. The ocean stretched out before",35,"she had been telling me that he needed some time to clear his head, and now I could see why. The ocean stretched out before him, a vast expanse of blue that seemed to mirror the turmoil brewing inside him. I knew that look, the one that said he was trying to make sense of something that didn't quite add up. His footsteps sank into the sand as he walked further away, the sound echoing through the stillness of the morning. I stood there, frozen in place, wondering what had brought him to this point, and what he would find as he walked along the shore."
I felt relieved the instant he said he would stay with me because it let Maddy off the hook. She would walk through hell for,me—and this cookout was her hell. I was glad she didn’t have to be here. Sometimes her reaction to Mom was more stressful than Mom herself.,"not have to deal with the guilt of leaving me alone in such a situation, and I was grateful for his presence, but also a little annoyed that",51,"not have to deal with the guilt of leaving me alone in such a situation, and I was grateful for his presence, but also a little annoyed that he had to be the one to tell me he was staying, not me, and I couldn't help but wonder why he had to be so nonchalant about it, like it was no big deal, when in reality it was a huge weight off my shoulders, and I felt a mix of emotions, relief, gratitude, and a hint of resentment, all swirling together in a complicated knot, as I tried to process the implications of his decision, and what it meant for our relationship, and for me, personally."

I remember one time, she stayed late to help a new employee who was struggling to understand a difficult concept, and she didn't leave until the employee felt confident and capable. It was just one of many examples of her dedication and compassion, and it's what made her such a beloved colleague and friend."
"When I got back to the cottage an hour later, Maddy was in the screened-in porch, reading. She","wore shorts and flip-flops, and she was drinking a beer.

It was never going to happen. I knew this. But Maddy wouldn’t let it go unless,"I tried—and really, I should try.

"I studied the woman sitting next to me. Imagine someone who went through what she did, turning out the way she had. Able to give",grace to someone who’d let her down so badly.

I was looking forward to the do-over.","was a dinner party, but I restrained myself, not wanting to ruin the evening",26,"was a dinner party, but I restrained myself, not wanting to ruin the evening for her, or for myself, as I had been feeling a mix of emotions, and I wasn't sure if she felt the same way, but the thought of her smile and the way her eyes sparkled in the dim light of the room had me questioning my decision, and now, as I stood in front of her, I couldn't help but wonder if I should take the chance and see where it might lead, or if I should continue to play it safe and risk losing the opportunity forever."
I’d tried to be softer with her the last few days. The energy shift I’d had over Mom after my talk with Emma,"was almost as bad as being mad at her. At least when I was mad, I didn’t feel the guilt I was feeling now.","was a welcome change, but it seemed to have had an opposite effect on her, as she'd become even more withdrawn",47,"was a welcome change, but it seemed to have had an opposite effect on her, as she'd become even more withdrawn and distant, her eyes clouding over with a mix of sadness and frustration, and I couldn't help but wonder if I'd inadvertently made things worse, or if it was just a coincidence, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that maybe I'd been too gentle, too accommodating, and that what she really needed was a firm hand, a clear boundary, and a honest conversation, but how could I bring that up without pushing her further away, and what if I was wrong, what if I was just making things worse, and the uncertainty was eating away at me, making it hard to sleep at night, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was running out of time, that I needed to act soon, or risk losing her forever."
"This was another thing I was trying not to think about—her leaving. I should be happy that she came at all, that she wasn’t in Hawaii. We still had three more dates, maybe more if I could convince her. I’d already gotten a freebie the other night at","Mom’s. But I dreaded the clock running out.

But it was hard to shake the feeling that I was running out of chances to make a real connection with her. I found myself wondering what I could do to make her stay, to make her see that I was worth investing in. The more I thought about it, the more I felt a sense of desperation creeping in, and I knew I had to do something to change the course of things. I decided to take a chance and be more open with her, to let her see the real me, flaws and all. It was a risk, but I felt like I had nothing to lose and everything to gain."
"“Yeah,” I said. “Thank you. There’s actually something else you can help me with too,” I","said, looking at them. “I need help making sure I can still see Emma until she goes.”","wasn't something I had planned on asking you, but I was wondering if you could tell me",33,"wasn't something I had planned on asking you, but I was wondering if you could tell me more about the history of this old mansion we're standing in."
Emma pulled two Ziploc bags from her purse. They had Wheat Thins and celery in them.

"I think I would have been embarrassed if I’d been on a date with anyone else. My mother, sobbing drunk the night before",she left for prison. But I knew Emma didn’t judge.

We talked about everything and nothing, and I found myself laughing more than I had in weeks. It was a strange, awkward, and wonderful feeling, like we were two puzzle pieces that fit together in a way that felt almost perfect."

"Amber drew her arm back and threw the large glass thing again, only this","time it bounced off the car’s hood, hit the concrete, and broke in half.","time the object seemed to be moving at a slower pace, as if it was suspended",28,"time the object seemed to be moving at a slower pace, as if it was suspended in mid-air, and the sound it made was almost deafening, echoing through the empty streets, causing a few passersby to stop and stare in confusion, their faces a mixture of shock and curiosity, while Amber stood frozen, her eyes fixed on the spot where the object had landed, her mind racing with the possibilities of what could have caused such a strange occurrence, and whether it was a sign of something more sinister lurking beneath the surface of their seemingly ordinary lives."
"“I have the van,” he said, his hands wandering. “Alex can’t drive it yet, so",it’s just sitting there. Uber the next time you come over and take my car home.”,"it's up to me to take it to the mechanic for the routine check-up, and I was thinking",31,"it's up to me to take it to the mechanic for the routine check-up, and I was thinking of heading out now, but I'm not sure if I should go alone or ask someone to come with me, maybe Rachel or Emily, they're both good with cars and it would be nice to have some company on the road, but I also don't want to bother them if they're busy, so I'll probably just go myself, it's not like it's a big deal, just a routine check-up, but still, I'd feel better with someone there, just in case something goes wrong, and I don't want to be stuck on the side of the road with a broken-down van, that would be a real hassle, so I'll just go ahead and ask Rachel, she's always been good with cars, and she owes me a favor, so it's only fair that I ask her, and I'm sure she'll say yes, she's always willing to help out, and it'll be nice to have some company on the road, it gets pretty boring driving alone, and I could use the conversation, I've been feeling a bit isolated lately, so it'll be good to have some adult conversation, and maybe we can even grab some lunch on the way, that sounds like a plan, yeah, I'll go ask Rachel now, and we can head out together, that sounds like a great way to spend the afternoon."

"I came downstairs still in my pajamas, following the smell of bacon, glad I was actually in the right headspace to eat with everyone. When the stair creaked","as I made my way to the kitchen, Sarah poked her head out the door and saw me coming. “She’s here!” She darted back the way she came.","that I was not the only one who had risen early, I saw my mother already in the kitchen, busily flipping the sizzling strips of bacon",56,"that I was not the only one who had risen early, I saw my mother already in the kitchen, busily flipping the sizzling strips of bacon in the pan, her hair tied up in a loose bun and a warm smile on her face, as she hummed along to the radio playing softly in the background, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafting through the air, mingling with the savory scent of the bacon, making my stomach growl with anticipation, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of comfort and contentment wash over me, as I made my way to the kitchen to join her, the morning sunlight streaming through the windows, casting a warm glow over the scene, and for a moment, everything felt right with the world."
