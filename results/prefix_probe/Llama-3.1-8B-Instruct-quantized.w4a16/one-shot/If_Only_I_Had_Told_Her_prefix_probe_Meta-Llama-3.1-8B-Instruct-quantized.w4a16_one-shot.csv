I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that,"we were crashing at my house, and I felt it was my duty to be the one to take the blows.","he was hiding something from her, and I couldn't let her get hurt again, not after what happened",41,"he was hiding something from her, and I couldn't let her get hurt again, not after what happened with Alex and Emily a few months ago, which still lingered in the air like an unresolved issue, a constant reminder of the fragility of trust and the importance of being there for one another, especially when the going gets tough, and it seemed like Jack was about to walk into a similar situation, so I stepped in, trying to protect Autumn from the potential heartache that I knew all too well, having witnessed the devastating effects of a broken relationship firsthand."
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.","decided to take a break from the usual routine and explore the nearby woods, which had been a topic of conversation for quite some time,",49,"decided to take a break from the usual routine and explore the nearby woods, which had been a topic of conversation for quite some time, with many locals claiming to have spotted a mysterious figure lurking in the shadows, and as we walked deeper into the forest, the trees seemed to grow taller and the silence grew thicker, until we stumbled upon an old, dilapidated cabin, its wooden boards creaking in the gentle breeze, and Jack, being the thrill-seeker that he is, insisted on investigating further, while Autumn hesitated, her eyes fixed on the cabin's entrance, as if she sensed something was off, and I, being the voice of reason, tried to caution them both, but they just laughed it off, and we stepped inside, where the air was thick with the scent of decay and rot, and the darkness seemed to swallow us whole."
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.","for my modesty, but the sound of his footsteps on the creaky floorboards is a stark reminder",36,"for my modesty, but the sound of his footsteps on the creaky floorboards is a stark reminder that I am not alone in this moment, and my heart begins to beat at a slightly faster pace as I sense his presence drawing closer, the air thickening with anticipation."
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,"can't help but glance over at the tent, where Sarah is quietly packing up her belongings, her eyes fixed on the",41,"can't help but glance over at the tent, where Sarah is quietly packing up her belongings, her eyes fixed on the ground, her face a mask of calm, but her body language screaming otherwise, and I feel a pang of guilt for not being more supportive, for not being able to shield her from the harsh realities of our situation, and Jack's voice cuts through my thoughts, his words a harsh reminder that we can't afford to dwell on our emotions, not now, not when we're in the middle of a war zone, and he leans in, his voice taking on a more serious tone, ""We need to get moving, we can't stay here any longer, the enemy is closing in, and we need to get to the extraction point before it's too late."""
"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with","the word “type.” Autumn makes a noise in the tent, and we both hold our breaths and listen.","a faint whisper, ""I'm so tired, I just can't keep going like this anymore."" The weight of his",35,"with a faint whisper, ""I'm so tired, I just can't keep going like this anymore."" The weight of his words settles heavily in the silence that follows, and I sense a deep-seated desperation lurking beneath the surface of his exhaustion."
"“Zoned out the way she does? You have been so, so…","Like last week!” Jack asks, “How could you have missed that game?”","often find yourself lost in thought, staring blankly into space, and",23,"often find yourself lost in thought, staring blankly into space, and forgetting about the world around you, don't you?"
“Why don’t we restart the movie? We can all watch it.” Jack,gives me a look to remind me that our other conversation isn’t over.,"could see the confusion on Sarah's face, but she hesitated for a moment",25,"could see the confusion on Sarah's face, but she hesitated for a moment before nodding in agreement, and the group began to rewind the movie, eager to relive the thrilling plot twist that had left them all speechless the first time around."
"I walk Jack to his car, and when he turns to me with that","look on his face, I know what he’s going to say. I open my mouth.","smile that always seemed to hint at a secret joke, I couldn't help",29,"smile that always seemed to hint at a secret joke, I couldn't help but feel a pang of curiosity about what he was thinking, and whether it was something I should be worried about, or simply a reflection of his usual carefree nature, which had always been a source of comfort to me, but lately seemed to be hiding something beneath the surface, and I found myself wondering if I should ask him about it, or if it was better to just let it go, and pretend I hadn't noticed anything out of the ordinary, but as I looked into his eyes, I saw a glimmer of something there that made me think it was worth exploring further."
"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke. Surely the school administrators knew we had always been together, were meant to be together. Surely, if I looked around the cafeteria, she would be there?","together was a small consolation, as I found myself wandering the empty cafeteria, searching for a place to sit, when I spotted Jack sitting alone at a table by the window, his eyes fixed",61,"together was a small consolation, as I found myself wandering the empty cafeteria, searching for a place to sit, when I spotted Jack sitting alone at a table by the window, his eyes fixed on a book, his dark hair falling across his forehead in a way that made me pause for a moment, and then I felt a sudden pang of curiosity, wondering who this quiet, introspective boy was, and why he seemed so out of place in this bustling hall, and I found myself drawn to him, like a magnet to steel, and before I knew it, I was sitting down across from him, trying to play it cool, but my heart racing with excitement, as we exchanged awkward smiles and I asked him what he was reading, and he looked up, startled, and our eyes met for the first time, and I felt a jolt of electricity run through my entire body, and I knew in that instant, that this was going to be a year unlike any other."
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time. I didn’t sit down because I recognized Jack though; I simply sat at the first empty seat, defeated. But Jack remembered me. He asked me if I ever watched pro soccer. I said yeah, not really interested in conversation, not really listening, wondering what Autumn was doing.","dismissed us early, and it was clear that Jack had been thinking about our conversation from the previous day. He looked at me with a hint of a smile and said, ""Hey, glad you could make it. I was starting to think I'd have to eat alone again."" I smiled back and replied, ""Yeah, I'm glad",97,"dismissed us early, and it was clear that Jack had been thinking about our conversation from the previous day. He looked at me with a hint of a smile and said, ""Hey, glad you could make it. I was starting to think I'd have to eat alone again."" I smiled back and replied, ""Yeah, I'm glad I could join you. I was thinking about what you said yesterday, and I have to admit, it got me thinking. I've been doing a lot of thinking about my future, and I'm not sure what I want to do after graduation. I know I want to do something with sports, but I'm not sure if I want to play professionally or coach. What about you, have you given any more thought to your plans?"" Jack took a sip of his drink and leaned in, his eyes lighting up with excitement, ""Actually, I've been thinking a lot about it, and I think I've made up my mind. I'm going to try out for the college team, and if I make it, I'm going to go for it. I've always dreamed of playing at the next level, and I think this is my chance. What about you, are you going to try out for the team?"" I thought for a moment before responding, ""I don't know, I'm not sure if I'm good enough. But I do know that I want to stay involved in sports, maybe as a coach or a trainer. I've been thinking about going back to school to get a degree in sports management, but I'm not sure if that's the right path for me. I guess what I'm saying is that I'm still figuring things out, but I'm excited to explore my options and see where life takes me."" Jack nodded in understanding, and we both sat in silence for a moment, enjoying our food and each other's company. The conversation flowed easily, and before we knew it, we had been talking for hours, lost in our own little world. As we finished our meal and prepared to part ways, I felt a sense of gratitude towards Jack for being a good listener and a true friend. I knew that I could always count on him to be there for me, and I looked forward to seeing where life would take us next."
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.","was taken aback by the change in her appearance, and for a moment, they just stood there, the only sound being the rustling of leaves beneath their feet.

Jack's eyes wandered, taking in the sight of Autumn's new look, and he couldn't help but feel a mix of surprise and curiosity. Autumn, on the other hand, seemed to be enjoying the attention, a hint of a smile still playing on her lips. She took a step forward, her confidence growing with each passing second, and Jack found himself taking a step back, unsure of how to react to this new, unfamiliar side of his friend. The air was filled with an awkward silence, and it was clear that this was a moment that would change the dynamics of their friendship forever."
"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face. He didn’t believe that Autumn was—or ever had been—my friend. The daughter of my mom’s best friend, who was around a lot? Sure. But he thought I had deluded myself into believing this hot girl was my friend.","his face, a mixture of sadness and regret that seemed to linger long after he had closed the door behind him. It was a fleeting glance, but it left an indelible mark on my mind, a reminder of the weight of his unspoken",79,"his face, a mixture of sadness and regret that seemed to linger long after he had closed the door behind him. It was a fleeting glance, but it left an indelible mark on my mind, a reminder of the weight of his unspoken words and the secrets we both knew but dared not speak. As I drove away from his house, the silence between us seemed to grow thicker, a palpable presence that filled the space between us like a heavy fog. I couldn't help but wonder what had led him to this point, what had driven him to look at me with such a deep sense of sorrow and longing. Was it something I had done, or was it something he had been carrying with him for a long time, something that had finally come to a head in that moment? The questions swirled in my mind like a maelstrom, refusing to be silenced by the hum of the engine or the rhythmic beat of the wheels on the road. And as I drove further and further away from his house, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had just witnessed something important, something that would change the course of our friendship forever."
"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.","of the changing leaves and the vibrant colors of the season were displayed proudly on my walls, and the scent of pumpkin spice wafted through the air, enticing",58,"of the changing leaves and the vibrant colors of the season were displayed proudly on my walls, and the scent of pumpkin spice wafted through the air, enticing him to join in on the festivities. I even convinced my mother to bake a few pies, which she did with a hint of reluctance, but a smile on her face, as she knew how much it meant to me. Jack would often remark on the coziness of our home during this time, and how it felt like a warm hug on a chilly autumn day. As the leaves continued to fall, I found myself growing more and more attached to the season, and I began to see the beauty in the way the sunlight filtered through the trees, casting a warm glow over everything. I started to notice the way the air felt crisper, the way the sounds of nature seemed to come alive, and the way the world seemed to slow down just a bit. It was as if the world was holding its breath, waiting for the magic of autumn to unfold, and I felt grateful to be a part of it all."
"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still","friends. On the last day of school before winter break, Jack finally said something. I cannot remember what I had been telling him, only that it had been about Autumn.","in a romantic relationship, as I had hoped, and he seemed to be under the impression that I had simply been using her as a confidante, a notion that I couldn't shake off,",59,"still in a romantic relationship, as I had hoped, and he seemed to be under the impression that I had simply been using her as a confidante, a notion that I couldn't shake off, even though I knew it wasn't entirely true, and I found myself wondering if I had been foolish to think that our friendship could ever be more than just that, and Autumn seemed to sense my unease, and her eyes met mine with a hint of understanding, but also a touch of sadness, as if she too knew that our friendship had reached a point of no return, and I felt a pang of regret for not being able to bridge the gap between us, and for not being able to express my true feelings to her, and I knew that I had to accept that our friendship was all we would ever have, and that it was better to cherish it for what it was, rather than trying to force it into something more, but it was hard to let go of the hope that things could have been different, and that Autumn and I could have been more than just friends, and I knew that I would always wonder what could have been, and that our friendship would always be tinged with a hint of what could have been, and I knew that I would always carry a piece of Autumn with me, and that she would always be a part of me, and I knew that I would always look back on our friendship with a sense of longing, and a sense of what could have been, and I knew that I would always cherish the memories of our time together, and the laughter we had shared, and the late night conversations we had, and the quiet moments we had shared, and I knew that our friendship would always be a bittersweet reminder of what could have been, and what we had lost, and I knew that I would always look back on our friendship with a sense of nostalgia, and a sense of longing, and a sense of what could have been, and I knew that I would always carry the memory of Autumn with me, and that she would always be a part of me, and I knew that our friendship would always be a part of me, and that it would always be a part of my story, and I knew that I would always look back on our friendship with a sense of appreciation, and a sense of gratitude, and a sense of what could have been, and I knew that I would always cherish the memories of our time together, and the laughter we had shared, and the quiet moments we had shared, and I knew that our friendship would always be a reminder of what could have been, and what we had lost, and I knew that I would always look back on our friendship with a sense of nostalgia, and a sense of longing, and a sense of what could have been, and I knew that I would always carry the memory of Autumn with me, and that she would always be a part of me, and I knew that our friendship would always be a part of me, and that it would always be a part of my story, and I knew that I would always look back on our friendship with a sense of appreciation, and a sense of gratitude, and a sense of what could have been, and I knew that I would always cherish the memories of our time together, and the laughter we had shared, and the quiet moments we had shared, and I knew that our friendship would always be a reminder of what could have been, and what we had lost, and I knew that I would always look back on our friendship with a sense of nostalgia, and a sense of longing, and a sense of what could have been, and I knew that I would always carry the memory of Autumn with me, and that she would always be a part of me, and I knew that our friendship would always be a part of me, and that it would always be a part of my story, and I knew that I would always look back on our friendship with a sense of appreciation, and a sense of gratitude, and a sense of what could have been, and I knew that I would always cherish the memories of our time together, and the laughter we had shared, and the quiet moments we had shared, and I knew that our friendship would always be a reminder of what could have been, and what we had lost, and I knew that I would always look back on our friendship with a sense of nostalgia, and a sense of longing, and a sense of what could have been, and I knew that I would always carry the memory of Autumn with me, and that she would always be a part of me, and I knew that our friendship would always be a part of me, and that it would always be a part of my story, and I knew that I would always look back on our friendship with a sense of appreciation, and a sense of gratitude, and a sense of what could have been"
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah?

"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind","yourself, ‘Autumn is where she wants to be right now, and that’s okay. I’m still great, and I’ll be around if she needs me.’ Hmm?” She squeezed my foot again.","your parents that you're doing well in school, and that you're part of a team, which is a great way to build confidence and self-esteem.

And don't forget to take care of yourself, both physically and mentally, by getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and doing things that make you happy.

"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly.

This realization was a wake-up call, and I knew I had to make some changes if I wanted to succeed in the long run."
"Jack and I had worried one of us might not make it on the junior varsity team. When the lists were posted,","I searched for my name on the JV list and was devastated to not see it. Still, I was happy for Jack.","we anxiously gathered around the coach, our hearts racing with anticipation, as he began to read out",44,"we anxiously gathered around the coach, our hearts racing with anticipation, as he began to read out the names, and our eyes scanned the board, searching for our own, our palms growing sweaty with nervous excitement, and our minds racing with worst-case scenarios, but as the coach called out the final name, a mix of relief and elation washed over us, and we let out a collective sigh of relief, grateful that we had made the cut, but also aware that the real challenge was only just beginning, as we prepared to face the rigorous practices and intense competition that lay ahead."
"Jack told me later that my ability to brush off the snarky comment from that junior, my new teammate,",made me seem cool. There had been chuckles of appreciation according to him.

"The varsity soccer team practiced on the north field, near the student parking lots.

Meanwhile, the team managers were responsible for distributing water bottles and first aid kits to the players, ensuring they stayed hydrated and safe throughout the practice. As the sun began to set, the teams took a short break to rest and recharge before continuing their intense training session. The atmosphere was filled with a mix of determination and camaraderie, as the players supported and encouraged each other to push their limits and strive for excellence. The coaches were impressed with the team's progress and were confident that they would be a force to be reckoned with in the upcoming tournament."
"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me. I was excited to tell him that practice hadn’t been as hard as I thought.,"prefer to drive myself home, as I had my own car parked nearby.

"We all joined Jack on the low wall, waiting to get picked up. We didn’t talk that much, but the next day, as I trudged from the north field to","the south, I saw the girls by the gym door again.

As I walked, the rhythmic sound of my boots on the dirt path was the only noise that broke the silence, a stark contrast to the lively chatter and laughter that had filled the air the day before. I wondered what the day would bring, and whether our little group would still be together when the sun set over the fields."
"What if, this morning, she woke up in the tent before I thought?

"It strikes me how backward my plan sounds: give up a girl who adores me, who I love well enough, to be a disciple for a different girl who will","never fall for me.

“I already know why you did it.” She doesn’t have to explain that part. I know she’s never wanted me like that.

“I don’t like him.” I shrugged. “I told you before: Autumn’s an old friend from when we were kids. Sucks that she,"likes such a show-off.” I shrugged again.

I've got a lot on my plate right now, and I don't want to get caught up in anything that might distract me from my goals.
