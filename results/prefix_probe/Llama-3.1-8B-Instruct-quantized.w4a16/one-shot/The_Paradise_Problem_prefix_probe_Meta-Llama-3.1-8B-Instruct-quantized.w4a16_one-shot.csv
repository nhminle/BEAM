"“I definitely need to go back to the beginning,” I say, wiping my eyes. I mime an explosion at my temples. “Like—my mind is blown right now. You dressed like a middle schooler around the house.

A story of a man who was once just like me, trying to make it in the world, one step at a time. I'm not sure what's more shocking, the fact that you were incognito rich or that you managed to keep it a secret for so long. I'm still trying to process it all, my mind racing with questions and what-ifs. What was it like, living a double life? Did you ever feel like you were living a lie?

“Correct.” He looks down to his lap. “Only Jake knew the real situation. The rest of my family was disappointed that,"I didn’t let them throw me a big wedding, but I guess they weren’t all that surprised.

"He looks me over again, top to bottom, and the defeat in his eyes makes me realize the true extent of my unshowered, feral chaos. “Actually,","Anna,” he says, “I need you to come with me to my sister’s wedding in Indonesia and convincingly play the part of my very loving wife.”","it's not exactly the most dignified appearance I've ever presented, but I suppose it's a small price to pay for the freedom I've gained.",52,"it's not exactly the most dignified appearance I've ever presented, but I suppose it's a small price to pay for the freedom I've gained."
"It’s surreal to be here with her after all this time. I was so close to being done with this, so near to the finish line, yet here I am, having to improvise an intricate plan B at the eleventh hour with a Muppet in human form as my co-conspirator. Don’t get me wrong, beneath the baked, unshowered disarray, Anna is still a beautiful woman, with enormous brown eyes, creamy skin, and long, willowy limbs.

"As roommates, we didn’t know each other well—that much is probably obvious—but there is an intimacy to sharing a space with someone, a certain kind of kinship that comes with daily proximity.

I'll explain everything to you once we get there, but for now, just go with it. Can you do that for me?"
Her eyes go round. “The fam—” Anna shakes her head. “You know what? Never mind. Of,"course you have a plane.” Straightening, she asks, “So, why was I in Cambodia? Photography? Fabric design?”","course, it's not like I haven't heard it before, but still, it's not something you hear every day, and I'm not",33,"course, it's not like I haven't heard it before, but still, it's not something you hear every day, and I'm not sure I believe it, even though I've seen some strange things in my time, and I've learned to keep an open mind, but this one sounds like a wild story, and I'm not sure I want to get involved, but at the same time, I'm curious, and I have to admit that I'm a bit intrigued, so I'll ask you to continue, but please, be careful what you say, because I don't want to get caught up in something that's not good for me or anyone else."
"Once, when we were roommates, Anna flew to Seattle with a friend. It had been her first time on an airplane, and she struggled so much navigating the travel website that she brought me her laptop at midnight and asked for help. I finished the transaction for her, prebooked the car","to the airport, and then quietly tracked the ride the day she left to make sure she got there okay. When she got home, she made a point of thanking me for the help. Apparently, the trip itself was fine, but the highlight for her had been flying on an airplane.","rental, and even helped her find a hotel that was within her budget.

She was so grateful that she offered to repay me by cooking dinner for me the following night. I agreed, and she surprised me with her culinary skills, whipping up a delicious pasta dish from scratch. As we sat down to eat, she told me about her excitement for the trip and all the things she wanted to see and do in Seattle, from visiting the Space Needle to taking a ferry ride to Bainbridge Island. I listened intently, happy to see my friend so thrilled about her adventure. The next morning, she left for the airport, and I stayed behind to finish some work, but I couldn't help feeling a little envious of her travels. A few days later, she returned, and we spent the evening swapping stories about our respective experiences. She regaled me with tales of the stunning natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest, while I shared with her my own stories of the city's vibrant music scene. As the night drew to a close, we both agreed that we couldn't wait to plan our next adventure together."

I feel her looking at me for a quiet beat. “I think you’re joking. I’m,not sure.” Anna downs the rest of her prosecco. “A hint of danger. I like it.”,"not the kind of person who would be interested in someone like you, but I suppose",31,"not the kind of person who would be interested in someone like you, but I suppose you're right, I do feel a spark when you're around, and I'm not sure I can ignore it anymore."

"I walk back inside, realizing I’d been so focused on the sleeping situation, I haven’t properly flailed over the sheer bliss that is our bungalow. In fact, I’m pretty sure the only thing in here I could afford is the roll of eco-friendly toilet paper I can clearly see from where I stand. And even that looks pretty fancy. There’s a real Isle Esme feel to the decor (if you know, you know), with carved bamboo, recycled teak, jellyfish light fixtures, and a massive canopy bed. Wide windows and the open entrance","bring the outside in and allow me to glance over at West, who seems to be mid–mental spiral, managing to look even more morose than he did thirty seconds ago.

The eco-friendly toilet paper, while a nice touch, seems almost an afterthought in this haven of tranquility.

"I have a lot of faults. I drink milk from the carton, I never make my bed, I am slothful, and sometimes I’ll just set the new roll of toilet paper on top of the empty roll instead of changing it.

The thought of saving some for later is just a myth perpetuated by people who don't truly understand the concept of instant gratification. I mean, why settle for a few when you can have the entire bag and savor every last morsel? The guilt of overindulgence is a small price to pay for the pure joy of devouring an entire bag of peanut M&M's in one sitting. And besides, what's a little extra weight or a few extra calories when you're already a self-proclaimed monster? The real question is, can I get away with eating the entire bag in one sitting without anyone noticing? Or will I have to resort to hiding the evidence in the trash or under the couch cushion? The thrill of the hunt for the last few M&M's is exhilarating, and the satisfaction of finding them is like a little victory. But let's be real, it's not just about the M&M's - it's about the principle. It's about embracing my inner glutton and not apologizing for it.

I lay there for a moment, taking in the peaceful atmosphere, the soft moonlight streaming through the window, and the comforting feeling of her presence beside me. It was a rare moment of stillness in our chaotic lives, a brief respite from the constant demands of work, family, and social obligations. As I drifted back to sleep, I felt a sense of gratitude for this quiet moment, and for the love that filled my life with meaning and purpose. But as the minutes ticked by, I began to feel a growing sense of unease, a nagging feeling that something was off, that the tranquility was about to be shattered by some unseen force. I tried to shake off the feeling, telling myself it was just my imagination, but it lingered, a persistent whisper in the back of my mind, refusing to be silenced."

"“JESUS CHRIST,” I BLURT, the second I turn at the corner of our bridge and step onto the deck of our bungalow. Anna is curled up in","a papasan, with a sketch pad in her seemingly bare lap.
