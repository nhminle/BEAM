"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and","only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking.

The initial shock of their surroundings had begun to wear off, and they were starting to grasp the magnitude of their situation. Graham, a seasoned naval officer, found himself struggling to comprehend the sheer scale of the technological advancements that had taken place. He marveled at the towering skyscrapers, the flying machines that zipped through the air, and the small, glowing rectangles that everyone seemed to carry with them. The others, a diverse group of individuals from various walks of life, were equally bewildered, but they were all united in their determination to make the most of this unexpected opportunity. As they began to explore their new surroundings, they stumbled upon a group of people who claimed to be experts in the field of time travel, and they were eager to learn more about their situation and the circumstances that had brought them to this point in time. The team of experts, led by a woman named Dr. Rachel Kim, explained that the expats had been brought to the twenty-first century as part of a top-secret government experiment, designed to study the effects of time travel on the human mind and body. They had been extracted from their original time period using a device that manipulated the space-time continuum, and they would be staying in the future for an indeterminate amount of time, until they were deemed ready to return to their own era. As the expats listened intently, they couldn't help but wonder what other surprises lay in store for them in this strange and wondrous new world."
"The house that the Ministry had provided was a late-Victorian redbrick, originally designed for local workers. Gore would have seen them built, if he’d lived into","his eighties.

The interior was a labyrinth of cramped corridors and drab, beige-painted rooms, the kind of space that seemed to suck the life out of anyone who spent too much time within its walls. Despite its uninviting atmosphere, the building had a certain charm, a testament to the era in which it was built. Gore's office, located on the second floor, was a small, windowless room with a single, flickering fluorescent light overhead. The walls were adorned with faded photographs of old London streets, their colors muted and worn, and a large, wooden desk sat in the center of the room, its surface cluttered with stacks of dusty files and papers. The air was thick with the scent of old books and stale air, a smell that seemed to cling to everything in the room. As he sat down at his desk, Gore couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him, a sense of connection to the past that he couldn't quite explain. He had always been drawn to this kind of place, the kind of place where history seemed to seep from every brick and every beam. And yet, as he began to sort through the files and papers on his desk, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched, that unblinking eyes were trained on him from the shadows, waiting for him to make his next move."

His eyes wandered to the clock on the wall, the ticking sound echoing through the silence, a reminder that time was running out. He took a long drag from his cigarette, the smoke curling upwards, as he tried to gather his thoughts and prepare for the long day ahead, filled with presentations and negotiations that would determine the fate of the project he had been working on for months."

The air was thick with the smell of cigarette smoke and the faint tang of metal, a smell that seemed to cling to Gore's skin like a bad omen. He paced back and forth in front of the makeshift kitchen, his eyes fixed on the small, flickering stove as he tried to will it to life. The silence was oppressive, broken only by the occasional creak of the old cabin and the soft hiss of the dying water supply. It was as if the very atmosphere itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen, something that would shatter the fragile calm and plunge them all into chaos. And then, without warning, the lights flickered and died, plunging the cabin into darkness."
"Gore was an officer from the dusk of the Age of Sail, not an engineer.

However, Gore's fascination with the mysterious and unexplained phenomena of the ocean was undeniable, and he had spent countless hours poring over the works of the great naturalists and philosophers of his time, from Aristotle to Darwin. His curiosity was piqued by the strange stories of sea monsters and uncharted waters that seemed to hold secrets and mysteries beyond human comprehension. As he stood on the deck of the ship, the salty spray of the sea on his face and the cries of the gulls overhead, he felt an inexplicable pull towards the unknown, a sense that there was more to the world than what met the eye. Little did he know, his life was about to take a dramatic turn, one that would lead him down a path of discovery and wonder, and into the very heart of the ocean's secrets."
"The more I got to know him, the more I discovered Gore was the most entirely realized person I’d ever met. In his own time, he had liked hunting, sketching, flute playing (he was very good at this), and","the company of other people.

Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. He had a deep appreciation for the natural world and spent countless hours exploring the woods and fields around his home, often returning with an armload of wildflowers or a new species of insect to add to his collection. Despite his many talents and interests, Gore was never one to seek the spotlight, content to let others take center stage while he worked behind the scenes, using his unique blend of creativity and analytical mind to bring people and ideas together in innovative and meaningful ways. His humility and kindness made him a beloved figure in our community, and I felt grateful to have had the opportunity to know him. As I looked back on our time together, I realized that Gore's greatest gift was not his many accomplishments, but the way he made everyone around him feel seen and valued, like they were the most important person in the world. His presence had a way of making even the most mundane tasks feel special, and his absence left a void that could never be filled. I still think about him often, wondering what he would say or do in a given situation, and I know that his memory will continue to inspire me for years to come."
"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note","with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea.

He would often remark on the similarities between the people of his time and those of the 19th century, how they were driven by the same desires, hopes, and fears. As he navigated the complexities of modern life, he found solace in the simplicity of a bygone era, where the pace of life was slower and the air was thick with the smell of coal and smoke. His observations were not just limited to the people, but also the architecture, the music, and the art, which he would often collect and display in his study, a testament to his love for the past. Despite his nostalgia, he was not a man stuck in time, but rather one who sought to learn from the past and apply its lessons to the present, to make sense of the world around him and his place in it. His unique perspective, shaped by his experiences and observations, allowed him to see the world in a way that was both timeless and timely, a true Renaissance man in every sense of the word."
"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to.

Some spoke of ghostly apparitions seen in the darkness, while others claimed to have heard eerie whispers carried on the wind. The tension on board was palpable, and the crew's unease was only exacerbated by the eerie silence that had fallen over the ship. The captain's voice, usually a steady and reassuring presence, was laced with a hint of concern as he called out to the crew to prepare for the impending storm, his words barely audible over the howling wind. The ship creaked and groaned beneath their feet, its wooden hull straining against the force of the gale, as the crew scrambled to secure the sails and batten down the hatches.

We've been studying the effects of prolonged isolation on the human psyche, and it's clear that the line between reality and delusion can become increasingly blurred. The subjects' perceptions of time, space, and even their own identities may be distorted, making it challenging to distinguish between what's real and what's a product of their own minds. Furthermore, the lack of external stimuli and social interaction can lead to a breakdown in cognitive function, resulting in erratic behavior and a heightened sense of paranoia. It's essential that we approach this situation with caution and empathy, considering the potential consequences of our actions on the individuals involved. We must also be prepared for the possibility that our presence may exacerbate their conditions, rather than alleviate them. The team's findings suggest that the subjects' experiences are not just a result of their individual circumstances, but also a reflection of the societal pressures and expectations that have shaped their lives. By understanding these underlying factors, we may be able to develop more effective strategies for supporting these individuals and helping them reintegrate into society. However, this will require a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating insights from psychology, sociology, and philosophy to create a comprehensive understanding of the complex issues at play."

The Council has been clear: we must ensure that the deceased remain in their designated realm, and that their presence here is eradicated. But Adela's words hinted at a deeper concern, one that went beyond mere protocol and into the realm of the unknown. She spoke of a prophecy, one that foretold of a time when the boundaries between life and death would be blurred, and the consequences would be dire.

The waiter, a charming Frenchman with a thick accent, took our order and recommended the special of the day, a classic Coq au Vin that Gore declared was ""just like his mother used to make."" As we waited for our food to arrive, Gore regaled us with stories of his childhood, of lavish dinner parties and elaborate feasts, of the intricate etiquette and the strict rules of conduct that governed every aspect of dining in his household. I listened, entranced, as he spoke of a bygone era, one that seemed both familiar and yet utterly foreign, a world of elegance and refinement that I could only imagine existing in fairy tales and old movies. The food arrived, and Gore dug in with gusto, savoring each bite with a look of pure delight on his face. I followed suit, and as we ate, I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder at the way Gore's eyes lit up when he talked about the things he loved, and the way his face fell when he spoke of the things he had lost.

What did this stranger's true intentions really are, and what would be the cost of our newfound friendship?"

The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, and the sky was painted with hues of pink and orange, a breathtaking sunset that seemed to match the warmth in Gore's eyes as he opened the door to his cozy little abode. We stepped inside, and I was immediately struck by the eclectic mix of antique furniture and modern decor, a testament to Gore's eclectic taste. He gestured for me to take a seat on the plush couch, and I did, feeling a sense of comfort wash over me as I sank into the soft cushions. Gore disappeared into the kitchen, returning with two glasses and a bottle of fine wine, which he poured with a flourish, his hands shaking slightly as he handed me a glass. I took a sip, feeling the smooth liquid slide down my throat, and smiled at Gore, who was watching me with an intensity that made my heart skip a beat. We sat there in comfortable silence for a moment, the only sound being the clinking of the ice in our glasses, before Gore finally spoke up, his voice low and husky, ""So, what do you think of my place?"" I took another sip of my wine, savoring the taste, before responding, my voice barely above a whisper, ""It's beautiful, Gore. You have a great eye for design."" Gore's face lit up with a smile, and he leaned forward, his eyes sparkling with excitement, ""Thanks, I've always loved collecting unique pieces and mixing them together to create something truly special."" As we chatted, the evening wore on, and the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the room in a warm, golden light.

"Graham used other words too, not wrong, exactly, but not right, like “your people,” or “your culture.” When I said, in a wincingly tight voice, that we had the same people and culture, he replied, mildly, “But I don’t think that we do.” Then came the image searches about Cambodia, on food and dress","and customs.

Graham's words echoed in my mind as I scrolled through the images, and I began to realize that our shared history and cultural heritage were not as identical as I had initially thought. The more I delved into the topic, the more I discovered the nuances of Cambodian culture that set it apart from my own. I started to see the beauty in these differences, and a newfound appreciation for the unique aspects of both our cultures began to grow within me. As I continued to explore, I found myself wondering about the experiences of Graham's family and how their cultural background had shaped their perspectives and values. I asked him about his childhood, and he shared stories of traditional Khmer festivals and holidays, which were vastly different from the celebrations I was familiar with. The more we talked, the more I realized that our cultural differences were not something to be feared or ignored, but rather something to be celebrated and learned from. I began to see that our shared humanity was not defined by our cultural similarities, but by our ability to appreciate and respect each other's differences. As the conversation continued, I felt a sense of connection and understanding that I had never experienced before, and I knew that this was just the beginning of a beautiful journey of cultural discovery and exchange."

The captain, a seasoned sailor with years of experience, had managed to shield himself from the worst of the blast, but the young officer, whose name was Lieutenant James, was not so fortunate. The explosion had torn through his arm, leaving a gaping wound that would take months to heal. Despite the pain and the risk of infection, Lieutenant James had refused to leave the expedition, determined to see it through to its conclusion. As they continued up the river, the sounds of the jungle grew louder, and the air thickened with the scent of exotic flowers and decaying vegetation. The crew was on high alert, their senses heightened as they navigated the treacherous waters, ever vigilant for signs of danger. The captain's orders were clear: they were to chart the river's course, to map its twists and turns, and to discover any hidden dangers that lay in wait. But as they rounded a bend in the river, they caught sight of something that made their hearts skip a beat: a massive waterfall, cascading down a rocky cliff, its roar thundering through the air like a living thing. The crew exchanged nervous glances, their faces set with a mix of awe and trepidation. What lay beyond the falls, they wondered, and what secrets would they uncover as they ventured deeper into the unknown?"
"It’s surprising, then, that I allowed Graham’s drawing of the projection device to enter my files as a joke, like a coin minted 70 BC.

I couldn't help but wonder if Graham had a hidden talent for engineering, or if this was simply a clever ruse to distract from his true intentions. As I continued to study the drawing, I began to notice subtle details that hinted at a deeper understanding of the underlying technology. The curves and angles seemed to suggest a level of sophistication that belied its humble origins as a classroom doodle. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized that this simple sketch might hold the key to unlocking a long-lost secret, one that could change the course of history forever."
"By the start of that summer, Graham was practically a native of the era. He wore button-ups and was clean-shaven to his cheekbones. He had a preferred washing-machine cycle.

He'd sit on the porch, sipping his coffee and watching the world wake up, the sound of birds chirping and children laughing carrying on the gentle breeze. It was a peaceful scene, one that Graham had grown to love, and he felt a sense of belonging that he'd never experienced before. As he sat there, he'd often think about his past, about the life he'd left behind and the people he'd left behind, wondering if they'd ever think of him, if they'd ever wonder what had become of the boy they once knew. But for now, he pushed those thoughts aside and focused on the present, on the simple joys of small-town life, where everyone knew each other's names and the local diner served the best pie in the county. Graham felt a sense of contentment wash over him as he took another sip of his coffee, feeling grateful for this new chapter in his life, one that he was determined to make the most of."
"There were others times when it felt as if Graham deliberately disliked the twenty-first century, as if assimilation was a form of treachery to his past.

"Thus, on a weekly basis, the expats were subjected to tests designed to trigger empathy or disgust, and scrutinized. The first tests were conducted in the laboratory booths, but they resembled the Ministry hospital wards so strongly that the expats had tremendous anxiety reactions and it was difficult to get serviceable data from them. Graham, for example, kept asking to be excused for a smoke—heart rate elevated—and struggled","to focus on the tests—eyes moving rapidly. I once found him the sole occupant of the fifth-floor smoking area (a pigeon-shit-encrusted balcony), methodically shredding a filter of a finished cigarette.

The expats were seated in a circle, and the tests were conducted by a team of researchers who were trained to remain neutral and unemotional. The tests were designed to elicit a range of emotions, from empathy to disgust, and the researchers were tasked with observing and recording the expats' reactions. Graham, still anxious from the previous day's experience, was the first to be tested. He was shown a series of images, some of which were disturbing and graphic, and his heart rate and skin conductance were monitored. The researchers were interested in seeing how he would react to the images, and whether he would exhibit any signs of empathy or disgust. Meanwhile, the other expats were being tested in a similar manner, each one undergoing a series of tests designed to push them to their emotional limits. The researchers were determined to understand the expats' emotional responses, and to see how they would react in a variety of situations. As the tests continued, the researchers began to notice a pattern emerging - some of the expats were more empathetic than others, while others seemed to be more prone to disgust. The researchers were intrigued by these findings, and they decided to delve deeper into the data to see if they could identify any underlying factors that might be contributing to these differences. They spent hours poring over the data, looking for any clues that might explain the expats' varying emotional responses. As they delved deeper into the data, they began to notice that the expats who were more empathetic tended to have a higher level of emotional intelligence, and were more likely to have experienced trauma in their past. The researchers were fascinated by these findings, and they decided to conduct further research to see if they could replicate the results. They also began to wonder if the expats' emotional responses might be influenced by their cultural background, and they decided to investigate this further. As they continued their research, the researchers encountered a number of challenges, including difficulties in recruiting participants and obtaining reliable data. However, they were determined to see their project through to its conclusion, and they were willing to do whatever it took to get the results they needed. In the end, their hard work paid off, and they were able to publish a paper on their findings, which sparked a lot of interest in the field of psychology. The researchers' work had shed new light on the complex and multifaceted nature of human emotions, and it had opened up new avenues for further research. The expats, who had been subjected to the tests, were unaware of the impact their participation had had on the field of psychology, but they were grateful to have been a part of something that had the potential to make a real difference in people's lives. As for Graham, he had been a bit shaken by the experience, but he was proud to have been a part of the research, and he was grateful for the opportunity to have contributed to the advancement of knowledge. He had learned a lot about himself and about human emotions, and he had gained a new appreciation for the complexity of the human experience. The researchers, meanwhile, were already planning their next project, and they were excited to see where their research would take them next. They were driven by a passion for discovery, and a desire to make a positive impact on the world. As they looked to the future, they knew that they would continue to face challenges and obstacles, but they were confident that their work would make a difference, and that it would ultimately lead to a greater understanding of the human experience. The researchers' work had shown that even the most seemingly mundane tasks could have a profound impact on people's lives, and they were eager to see where their research would take them next. They were driven by a sense of curiosity, and a desire to push the boundaries of human knowledge. As they continued their work, they knew that they would encounter new challenges and obstacles, but they were confident that their research would make a real difference in the world. The researchers' work had the potential to change the way people thought about human emotions, and to shed new light on the complexities of the human experience. They were excited to see where their research would take them, and they were eager to continue exploring the mysteries of the human mind. The researchers' work had shown that even the most seemingly insignificant details could hold the key to a deeper understanding of human emotions, and they were determined to continue uncovering the secrets of the human experience. As they delved deeper into their research, they began to realize that the expats' emotional responses were not just a reflection of their individual personalities, but were also influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including their cultural background, life experiences, and personal values. The researchers were fascinated by this complexity, and they were determined to explore it further"
"After that, the “empathy exams” returned more useful results—though there were other issues. A controversial test used pictures of soldiers from the First World War, caved and razed by new weapons. The disruption was terrible. Nineteen-sixteen had to be sedated. The other expats were horrified too. Even Sixteen-forty-five and Graham, who had","fought in large-scale battles, were laid out by the ultramodern scope of the harm.

Graham, on the other hand, was pale and silent, his eyes fixed on the image of a group of soldiers, their bodies mangled and twisted beyond recognition. The empathy exams were meant to gauge their emotional responses, but it seemed they were having the opposite effect, bringing back memories they thought they had long buried. The researchers were taken aback by the intensity of their reactions, and the team leader, a middle-aged woman with a kind face, approached them with a mixture of concern and curiosity. ""What's wrong?"" she asked, her voice soft and gentle. Sixteen-forty-five and Graham exchanged a glance, unsure of how to respond, but the woman's kind eyes put them at ease, and they began to open up about their experiences, sharing stories they had never told anyone before. The woman listened intently, her expression a mixture of sadness and understanding, and for the first time, the two expats felt a sense of connection with the researchers, a sense of trust that they had not felt in a long time. As they spoke, the room fell silent, the only sound the soft hum of the machines and the occasional beep of a monitor. The empathy exams had been a success, but not in the way anyone had expected. They had uncovered a depth of emotion, a complexity of feeling that had been hidden beneath the surface, and it was a revelation that would change everything."

I ordered a plate of the evening's special, a hearty beef stew, and waited for Rachel to fill me in on the latest gossip from the field.

The cool breeze carried the whispers of strangers, their conversations a gentle melody that seemed to dance in the darkness. Graham's eyes scanned the crowded sidewalks, his gaze lingering on the faces of the people passing by, each one a story waiting to be told, each one a mystery to be unraveled.

As he drew closer, I could see the faint outline of a map etched on the inside of his jacket, a crude drawing of the surrounding countryside with several locations circled in red.

The other members of the team began to filter in, their conversations hushed as they took their seats, each one aware of the weight of the decisions that would be made in this room. The Minister herself arrived last, her presence commanding attention as she took her seat at the head of the table, a stern expression on her face. The room fell silent, and Adela cleared her throat to begin the meeting, her voice steady and confident as she outlined the day's agenda, her words dripping with a sense of purpose and determination. The team listened intently, their faces a mask of seriousness, as Adela delved into the heart of the matter, her words painting a picture of a future that was both uncertain and fraught with possibility."
Adela was standing at the sink and anarchically disobeying the water ration by running her wrists under cold,"water. She looked unwell, but God alone knows how her plastic surgeon thought she was supposed to look.","water, her eyes closed in a moment of defiance against the scorching summer heat that had been plaguing",36,"water, her eyes closed in a moment of defiance against the scorching summer heat that had been plaguing the city for weeks, the sound of the faucet a soothing melody to her frazzled nerves as she tried to wash away the sweat and the memories of the argument she had with her sister just hours before."
"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it,","was a mystery. She didn’t enjoy the prestige, as the Secretary did, and she seemed bizarrely overworked for the proxy boss of a project in its pilot stage.","no one knew, but what was clear was that she had a hidden agenda, one that she was determined to keep under wraps, at least for now.

She spoke with a tone that was both condescending and patronizing, as if she was doing us a favor by even deigning to speak to us, her words dripping with an air of superiority that made our skin crawl. Her eyes seemed to bore into our very souls, searching for any sign of weakness or vulnerability that she could exploit, and her smile was a thin-lipped, calculating thing that sent shivers down our spines. We exchanged nervous glances, unsure of how to respond to her biting sarcasm and veiled insults, but she pressed on, her words spilling out in a torrent of condescension and disdain, each one a tiny dagger aimed squarely at our hearts."
"Graham put down his mug. He was blushing in that watercolor way that I found so beguiling, and I caught up with what I was looking at: an isolated man who had","just discovered that a woman with whom he was spending a lot of time would never be interested in him.

The sunlight filtering through the trees cast dappled shadows on his face, accentuating the lines of his profile, and for a moment, I forgot about the awkwardness of our encounter and was struck by the serenity of the scene before us. The air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and the only sound was the soft rustle of the wind through the branches. I felt a pang of curiosity about this man, who seemed so out of place in this wild, untamed environment, and I found myself wanting to know more about him, to understand what had brought him to this secluded spot, and what secrets he might be hiding behind those piercing blue eyes that seemed to hold a world of their own."
"Graham blew smoke out through his nose reflectively. “I see,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s fair to call him ‘grim,’ though you wouldn’t be the","first to say it.

His face was more like a map of worn leather, etched with the lines of a thousand midnights and a million miles of dusty roads. The corners of his eyes, though, were the only things that betrayed a glimmer of the man he used to be, a spark that still flickered with a hint of mischief and a dash of warmth. It was a spark that Graham had seen before, a spark that he had grown to appreciate over the years, and one that he knew he would miss dearly if it ever went out. As he watched, the old man's eyes seemed to cloud over, lost in thought, and Graham felt a pang of concern. He knew that look, that far-off gaze, and he knew that it usually meant trouble was brewing. ""What's on your mind, old man?"" he asked, his voice low and gentle, trying not to startle him. The old man's eyes snapped back into focus, and he looked at Graham with a hint of a smile, a smile that was both familiar and yet, somehow, completely foreign. ""Just thinking about the past,"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. ""Thinking about the choices we made, and the roads we took. Wondering which ones we'd do differently if we had the chance."" Graham nodded, his mind racing with the same thoughts, the same what-ifs. He knew that the old man was right, that the past was a labyrinth of choices and consequences, and that the only way to move forward was to face it head-on. But as he looked into those worn, weathered eyes, he knew that it was easier said than done."
"I was lightly haunted—at the level of a chronic but manageable digestive complaint—by the memory of those “vital” files in the bin, seals unbroken. But Adela didn’t issue any new orders. The bridges kept turning in their core reports, and the experiments kept running.

She just kept pushing me to keep collecting data, to keep the project running smoothly. But I knew that I couldn't keep going on like this.

"Graham hadn’t exhibited any behavior more eccentric than usual, but as he was a difficult man to read, I didn’t know whether I was witnessing a series of neurological events.

I had grown accustomed to his enigmatic nature, but this level of stillness was unsettling, and I found myself glancing at my watch for what felt like the hundredth time, wondering if I should intervene or simply let him be. The bird, seemingly oblivious to Graham's presence, continued to sing its sweet melody, the only sound breaking the silence of the afternoon. As I stood there, I couldn't help but think about the countless times Graham had pushed the boundaries of what was considered normal, and yet, in this moment, he seemed almost... fragile. I took a step closer, my eyes locked on his, searching for any sign of recognition, but his gaze remained fixed on the bird, his eyes unblinking. The air was heavy with an unspoken understanding, and I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized that I was witnessing something profound, something that went beyond the surface level of Graham's eccentricities. I hesitated, unsure of what to do next, as the bird took flight, leaving Graham's gaze still fixed on the empty space where it had perched, a haunting reminder of the mysteries that lay beneath his enigmatic exterior."

As the night wore on, the silence between us grew thicker, punctuated only by the occasional rustle of pages or the creak of the old building.

But it was quickly extinguished, leaving behind only a cold, hard mask of indifference. Salese, sensing the tension, cleared her throat and began to speak, her voice a gentle breeze on a summer's day, a stark contrast to the foreboding atmosphere that had settled over us.

The smell of cigarette smoke wafted through the air, mingling with the scent of the soap and shampoo that Graham had used earlier. I couldn't help but smile as I thought about how much he loved to sing in the shower, his voice booming off the tiles and making me laugh. As I stood there, I noticed that the water had started to drain, and Graham's singing had stopped. I called out to him, ""Hey, are you almost done?"" but there was no response. I took a step closer to the bathroom, my heart beating slightly faster with a mix of curiosity and concern. The water had stopped, and an eerie silence had fallen over the room. I pushed open the door, and a faint mist of steam wafted out, carrying with it the faint scent of cigarette smoke and something else – something sweet and floral. I called out again, this time a little louder, ""Graham, are you okay?"" But there was still no response. I took a deep breath and stepped inside, my eyes scanning the room for any sign of him. The shower was empty, the water having drained completely, but there was a faint trail of water leading from the tub to the bathroom door. I followed the trail, my heart pounding in my chest, and found Graham sitting on the floor, his back against the wall, a look of deep concentration on his face. He was staring at something on the floor, his eyes fixed intently on it. I approached him slowly, not wanting to startle him, and peered down to see what had captured his attention. It was a small, delicate flower, its petals a vibrant purple color, and it seemed to be glowing in the dim light of the bathroom. Graham's eyes flickered up to meet mine, and he smiled, a look of pure joy on his face. ""I found it,"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. ""I found the most beautiful thing I've ever seen."" I smiled back at him, feeling a sense of wonder and awe wash over me. ""What is it?"" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. Graham's eyes never left the flower as he replied, ""I don't know, but I think it's magic."" I felt a shiver run down my spine as I gazed at the flower, feeling a sense of enchantment wash over me. It was as if the flower was radiating an otherworldly energy, drawing us both in with its beauty and mystery. I reached out a hand to touch it, but Graham's hand shot out, grasping mine and holding it back. ""Don't touch it,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""I don't know what it is or what it can do, but I have a feeling it's not safe."" I hesitated, feeling a sense of trepidation wash over me. But Graham's grip on my hand was firm, and I knew that he was right. We sat there in silence for a moment, the only sound the gentle hum of the bathroom fan and the soft glow of the flower. Then, without a word, Graham stood up, the flower still clutched in his hand, and walked out of the bathroom, leaving me to follow him. I trailed behind him, my heart pounding in my chest, as we made our way through the house, the flower leading the way. We walked through the living room, past the kitchen, and out into the backyard, the warm sunlight casting a golden glow over everything. The flower seemed to be leading us to a small, overgrown garden, hidden away behind a tangle of vines and bushes. Graham pushed aside the foliage, revealing a small, secret world, filled with flowers and trees, and a small, sparkling pool of water. The flower glowed brightly in the center of it all, and I felt a sense of wonder and magic wash over me. ""What is this place?"" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. Graham's eyes sparkled with excitement as he replied, ""I've been coming here for years, but I've never shown it to anyone before. It's my secret garden."" I felt a sense of awe and gratitude towards him, and I knew that I was lucky to be a part of his life. We sat down on a bench, surrounded by the beauty of the garden, and Graham handed me the flower. I took it gently, feeling its petals soft against my skin, and inhaled its sweet, floral scent. As I did, I felt a sense of peace and contentment wash over me, and I knew that I was exactly where I was"
"With the exception of naval rations meted out during Discovery Service expeditions, cooked over campfires and valued for their fuel rather their flavor, Graham had never so much as heated a bowl of soup before arriving in the twenty-first century.

He discovered a talent for it, too, and soon his small apartment was filled with the aromas of roasting meats and baking bread, a far cry from the salted meats and dried biscuits of his naval days. As he cooked, he felt a sense of pride and accomplishment that he had not known since his days as a young officer, and he began to see the kitchen as a place of creativity and self-expression, rather than just a means of sustenance. But it was not just the cooking itself that brought him joy - it was the sense of connection it gave him to the people around him, the friends he had made in this new world, who would gather around his table to share in the fruits of his labor, and the sense of community that came with it. He had never felt so at home in this strange new world, and he knew that he owed it all to the simple act of cooking, and the joy it had brought him."

The men's conversation, though seemingly mundane, held a certain weight for her, a reminder that the world outside these walls was constantly evolving, leaving her own life stuck in a perpetual state of nostalgia. As she listened intently, she found herself drawn to the words of a young man, his voice laced with a quiet confidence that resonated deeply within her. His stories of innovation and progress sparked a fire within her, a flame that had long been smoldering, waiting to be fanned into a blaze. She felt a sense of longing, a yearning to break free from the shackles of her past and forge a new path, one that would allow her to leave her mark on the world, to make a difference, to be more than just a relic of a bygone era."
"How the topic of weed came up I couldn’t remember—probably during one of the vigorous debates about what the twenty-first century had genuinely improved, which in",the opinion of the expats was a mixed bag.

Some people had made great strides in technology and medicine, while others had only managed to create more problems for themselves. I was sipping on a cold beer, trying to stay out of the conversation, when my friend, Alex, brought up the topic of weed. He was a self-proclaimed expert on the subject, having spent countless hours researching its benefits and drawbacks. I listened intently as he began to explain the different types of weed, from the popular sativa and indica strains to the lesser-known hybrids. He spoke about the medicinal properties of CBD and THC, and how they could be used to treat a variety of ailments, from chronic pain to anxiety. As he spoke, I couldn't help but think about my own experiences with weed, both good and bad. I had tried it a few times in college, but never really understood the hype. But Alex's passion was infectious, and I found myself getting drawn into the conversation. Before I knew it, we had spent hours discussing the pros and cons of weed, and I was starting to see it in a whole new light."

The musicians, often referred to as ""song imprints,"" are essentially digital recordings of renowned artists, captured at the height of their careers and preserved for posterity. These imprints are then encoded onto small, intricately crafted music boxes, which can be purchased by music enthusiasts and collectors. The boxes are designed to mimic the sound and feel of a live performance, complete with subtle nuances and imperfections that are characteristic of the original artist's style. As a result, music lovers can now experience their favorite songs in a way that is both nostalgic and authentic, with the added benefit of being able to play them in the comfort of their own homes. The technology behind these music boxes has revolutionized the way people consume music, allowing for a more intimate and personalized connection with the artists they admire. However, some critics argue that this trend has led to a decline in the appreciation of live music, as people become increasingly reliant on the convenience of pre-recorded performances. Despite this, the music box industry continues to thrive, with new and innovative designs emerging all the time, each one pushing the boundaries of what is possible in terms of sound quality and artistic expression."

"As soon as she stepped in, I started making a tally of the evidence of unbeauty. There was a chair whose seat was filled with clothes too dirty for the wardrobe but too clean for the washing basket.

The floor was littered with crumpled up papers, receipts, and takeout menus, each one a reminder of a decision made in haste. The TV blared in the background, a constant hum of noise that seemed to vibrate through every cell in my body. I felt a sense of unease wash over me as I took in the state of her apartment, a space that was supposed to be her sanctuary, but now felt more like a war zone. I knew I had to tread carefully, to navigate this minefield of mess and chaos without setting off any landmines. I took a deep breath and began to survey the damage, trying to make sense of the chaos that surrounded me."

"I’d stopped wearing it—I was, at the time, thinking of the way my face might be received by a Victorian who didn’t approve of cosmetics—but I demonstrated the coverage of my sole foundation.

Margaret's eyes sparkled with curiosity as she reached out to gently touch my cheek, her fingers grazing the skin with a softness that sent a shiver down my spine. ""It's quite remarkable,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper, ""how something so simple can make such a profound difference in one's appearance."" I felt a surge of gratitude towards her, not just for her kind words, but for the way she saw me, truly saw me, without judgment or pretension. As we stood there, lost in the quiet moment, I realized that I had been wrong to think that I needed to hide my true self, that the imperfections and quirks that made me who I was were not something to be ashamed of, but rather something to be celebrated. And in that instant, I knew that I would continue to wear my foundation, not just to cover up my flaws, but to own them, to wear them like a badge of honor, and to let my true self shine through."

The Ministry's rules were clear: no personal communication devices were allowed, and any attempts to use them would be met with severe consequences, including but not limited to, confiscation of the device, detention, and in extreme cases, deportation. Graham had heard rumors of a black market for smuggled phones, but he had no idea if they were true. He had also heard whispers of a secret underground network of expats who had managed to evade the Ministry's surveillance, but he had no way of verifying these claims. As he walked through the sterile corridors of the Ministry's high-rise building, Graham couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched, and he wondered if he would ever be able to find a way to communicate with the outside world without the Ministry's knowledge."

"For a day or so, things were, once again, misflavored and uncomfortable between us. Graham’s relationship to sexuality was a mystery. I had no idea if he’d ever had a sex life, or if he wanted one. The most his Ministry psychoanalyst had been able to get out of him on the comparative boisterousness and acquisitiveness of twenty-first-century sex was that he found it terribly eighteenth. I had a copy","of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs.

I tried to bring up the subject with him again, but he deftly steered the conversation towards safer topics, leaving me to ponder the intricacies of his psyche. As the days went by, our interactions became increasingly stilted, and I began to feel like I was walking on eggshells around him, never quite sure how to navigate the unspoken boundaries between us. I couldn't help but wonder if I was the only one who felt this way, or if Graham was simply as lost as I was. The tension between us was palpable, and I found myself questioning whether our working relationship was sustainable in the long term. Despite my reservations, I couldn't deny the spark that still lingered between us, a spark that seemed to flicker to life whenever we were in close proximity. It was a spark that I couldn't quite explain, and one that I wasn't sure I was ready to extinguish. As I sat at my desk, staring at the report in front of me, I couldn't shake the feeling that Graham was hiding something from me, something that could change everything between us. I took a deep breath and tried to focus on the task at hand, but my mind kept wandering back to the enigmatic man who sat across from me, his eyes fixed intently on some point beyond my shoulder. I felt a shiver run down my spine as our gazes met, and for a moment, I thought I saw a glimmer of something there, something that looked almost like... interest. But it was quickly extinguished, leaving me wondering if I'd just imagined the whole thing. I pushed the thought aside and tried to concentrate on the report, but my mind was a jumble of questions and doubts, all centered around the one person who seemed to be at the heart of it all: Graham."
"I smiled. It was so hard not to treat the expats like blank slates onto which I might write my opinions. I understood the adage “knowledge is power” whenever I looked into Margaret’s face, the sultry peach color of her mouth and her acne glowing with unprinted newness. There was","something hauntingly young about all of them, a scarcity of cultural context that felt teenaged, and I didn’t know if my fascination with it was maternal or predatory.

I'd seen it happen to so many of my fellow expats, the way they'd get caught up in their own narratives, their own stories, and forget that everyone else had their own. I took a sip of my drink, feeling the cool liquid slide down my throat, and tried to focus on the present moment. The sounds of the city swirled around me, a cacophony of horns honking and people chattering, and I let myself get lost in it, letting the noise wash over me like a wave. Margaret, sensing my distraction, reached out and touched my arm, her hand warm and gentle, and I felt a jolt of electricity run through me. I turned to her, my eyes meeting hers, and for a moment, we just looked at each other, the world around us melting away.

But now, in hindsight, I wonder if I was wrong to do so. Was I blinded by my own emotions, my own desire to help? Or was there something more at play, something that I couldn't see? The more I think about it, the more I realize that I may have been played, that Adela may have been using me all along. The thought sends a shiver down my spine, and I'm left wondering what other secrets she may have been hiding."
I gave Graham history’s squeakiest bollocking. He hardly paid it attention. He wanted to know how it was possible,"for the Ministry to know that he had crossed the boundary, or indeed where he was, and I was tongue-tied.","that I had managed to get my hands on the infamous artifact, a relic from a civilization long thought to be",39,"that I had managed to get my hands on the infamous artifact, a relic from a civilization long thought to be extinct, and what I planned to do with it next.

One evening in early November I came home to the luscious mingled smells of cooking and smoking. Graham was sitting at the dining table with a cigarette between,"his lips, tapping at a laptop.

I dropped my bag on the floor and walked over to join him, sliding into the chair across from him and running a hand through my hair, feeling the stress of the day melt away as I took in the cozy atmosphere of our little home. Graham looked up at me with a hint of a smile, his eyes crinkling at the corners, and I could tell he was thinking about something, his mind working overtime as he often did when he was trying to come up with a plan or solve a problem. I leaned back in my chair, feeling the soft cushions envelop me, and asked, ""What's cooking?"" He took a drag on his cigarette, blowing out a stream of smoke that curled lazily towards the ceiling, and replied, ""Just dinner, but I was thinking we could make it a special night, just the two of us."" I raised an eyebrow, intrigued, and he continued, ""I was thinking we could try out that new recipe I found online, the one with the truffle oil and wild mushrooms."" My eyes widened at the mention of the expensive ingredient, and I felt a thrill of excitement at the prospect of a romantic evening in, just the two of us, with a delicious meal and a bottle of wine. I nodded, and Graham smiled, his eyes sparkling with anticipation, and I knew that this was going to be a night to remember."
"Graham had developed an interest in Southeast Asian food. He asked me questions about what my mother cooked, ferrying tiny melamine bowls under my mouth to check flavors. Sometimes I saw the same concentration on his face as when he sketched the alien shapes of the transmission","towers. He took in anecdotes about my childhood meals as if they would contribute to a portrait of a whole woman. He ignored the fact that mostly I cooked assorted chicken pieces on rice. I could tell him things about galangal, and he found that very profound.","that danced across the radar screens in the control room.

His love for the unknown was infectious, and I found myself drawn into his world, eager to learn more about the intricate flavors and spices that wafted from the kitchen. My mother's cooking was a mystery to me, a complex tapestry of aromas and textures that I had grown up with, but never truly understood. Graham's curiosity was a catalyst, and I found myself asking her questions, too, about the origins of certain dishes, the stories behind the recipes, and the secrets she kept hidden in the depths of her pots and pans. As we cooked together, the kitchen became a laboratory, a place where science and art collided, and the boundaries between cultures blurred. The melamine bowls, once a simple vessel for tasting, had become a tool for exploration, a window into the world of flavors and traditions that lay beyond our small town. And Graham, with his insatiable appetite for the unknown, was the catalyst for this culinary journey, one that would take us down a path of discovery, of experimentation, and of the joy of sharing a meal with others."
"At the end of the bridge year, the expats had to begin the next stage of assimilation—they had to get jobs. He wanted to rejoin the navy, despite its unrecognizable modernization.

We weighed the pros and cons of various options, from working in a small startup to joining a large corporation, and everything in between. As we navigated this challenging process, we discovered that our priorities and expectations were not always aligned, and we had to learn to compromise and communicate effectively in order to find a solution that worked for both of us. It was a difficult but ultimately rewarding experience that brought us closer together and helped us grow as individuals and as a couple."
"In the background, Graham’s laptop had been providing an inappropriate soundtrack (Motown again). It clocked into its next track, which was the Beatles cover of “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me.”","I started laughing—partly because it was the most ludicrous song that could play at that moment, and partly because it felt quintessentially Victorian of him to hate the Beatles, which he did.","The mellow melody and harmonies filled the room, but Graham's eyes remained fixed on the screen as he tried to meet the looming deadline for his project.

"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked","in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes. One of his first searches was charmingly housewifely: “Most challenging recipes”; “How to make cheese soufflé”; “What is miso paste?”; “Where to buy miso paste”; “How long has Japan been open to Europe?” A day or so after I’d read this report, I received another that listed the following search terms:","of his mind, or worse, that he'd stumbled upon some dark corner of the internet where he'd discovered a new and disturbing fascination with the occult.

I breathed a sigh of relief, thinking that perhaps Graham was not as lost as I had feared. But then, one day, I saw it: a search for ""how to build a homemade lie detector test."" My heart sank, and I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets Graham might be hiding behind his innocent-looking face. I decided to keep a closer eye on him, to see if I could uncover the truth behind his curious online activities. Little did I know, this was only the beginning of a much larger mystery that would soon engulf us all."
"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing,","as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday. This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option. We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit. Still, we had not told them about the death camps.","The makeshift barriers were a testament to the community's resilience, a patchwork of wooden planks and plastic sheeting that seemed to be holding back the deluge.

The smell of wet earth and damp fabric hung heavy in the air, a pungent reminder of the chaos that had been unleashed by the storm. As I waded through the knee-deep water, I spotted a group of children playing in the shallows, their laughter and shouts carrying above the din of the rain. Their parents, bundled up in waterproof jackets and scarves, watched over them with a mix of concern and amusement, grateful that the worst of the flooding seemed to have passed. The council's emergency response team was on the scene, directing the efforts of the volunteers and residents who were working together to mitigate the damage. Despite the challenges, there was a sense of camaraderie and determination in the air, a feeling that this community would weather the storm and emerge stronger on the other side."

The dim lighting and the soft hum of the fireplace created an air of intimacy, making it feel as though we were the only two people in the world. I couldn't help but notice the way his eyes crinkled at the corners as he smiled, a small, wry smile that hinted at a deeper complexity beneath his charming facade. As he continued to fidget with the ring, I found myself drawn to the way his fingers moved, the way his skin seemed to glow in the soft light, and I felt a flutter in my chest that I couldn't quite explain. It was as if time had slowed down, and all that existed was the two of us, suspended in this moment of quiet tension."
"Anne Spencer almost made it off those wards. After I read the email, an ancient and exuberant terror blazed through me.

The words on the screen seemed to sear themselves into my retina, and I felt my heart racing like a wild animal trapped in a cage. I tried to shake off the feeling, telling myself it was just a prank, a cruel joke played by some sadistic individual, but deep down, I knew better. The mention of Anne's name, the way it was typed with a sense of urgency and desperation, sent a chill down my spine. I thought back to the last time I saw her, the way she smiled at me with a hint of sadness in her eyes, and the way she whispered those fateful words: ""I'm in trouble, I need your help."" I had brushed it off as a mere figment of my imagination, but now, I wasn't so sure. The email was dated yesterday, and the message was simple: ""Meet me at the old oak tree at midnight. Come alone."" I felt a shiver run down my spine as I read the words again, my mind racing with possibilities. What had happened to Anne? And why did I feel an inexplicable sense of responsibility to find out?"

The room was spinning, and I could feel a cold sweat breaking out on my forehead. I was starting to feel a sense of panic, but I knew I had to try and remember what happened. I took a deep breath and focused on the memories, trying to piece together the events of the previous night. As I lay there, I noticed a piece of paper on the table in front of me, with a note scrawled in hasty handwriting: ""They're coming for you."" I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized that I was in grave danger, and I had no idea who was behind it or why."
