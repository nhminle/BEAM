He felt like a shadow of his former self, a mere imitation of the writer he once was, and the thought was both depressing and liberating, freeing him to explore new ideas and possibilities, but also terrifying, as he had no idea what the future held or if he would ever be able to recapture the magic that had made his early work so successful."

"“Butch and I were kids going to a one-room schoolhouse before the Second World War. We grew up in a no-stoplight dirt-road town fixing cars, patching them up, playing sports and then coaching them. As men we took part in town politics and maintained the town dump—very similar jobs, now that I think about it. We hunted, we fished, we put out grassfires in the summer and plowed the town roads in the winter. Knocked over a right smart of mailboxes doing it, too. I knew","him when no one knew his name—or mine—outside of a twenty-mile radius. I should have come to see him these last years, but I was busy with my own affairs. I thought to myself, there’s time. We always think that, I guess. Then time runs out. Butch was a fine artist, but he was also a good man. I think that’s more important. Maybe some here don’t and that’s all right, that’s all right. Thing is, I always had his back and he always had mine.”","everything about that town, from the way the sun rose over the fields to the way the creek ran dry in the summer.

When I got back from the war, I found out that Butch had been injured in combat, and it was a sobering reminder of the harsh realities of adulthood. We both came back changed men, but our bond remained unbroken. We continued to support each other, through thick and thin, and I'm grateful for that. Even now, as I look back on our childhood, I'm reminded of the simple joys of growing up in that small town, surrounded by good people and good friends. It's a memory that I'll always treasure, and one that I'll carry with me for the rest of my life."
“Has to be a reason?” Pop asked when I finished reading him Ms. Crawford’s letter. “Is that what she’s suggesting? I guess,she never heard about the twin brothers who won large sums of money in their respective state lotteries on the same day.”,"it's a bit cryptic, but it seems like she's implying that there's more to the story than what we've been told, and she wants",44,"it's a bit cryptic, but it seems like she's implying that there's more to the story than what we've been told, and she wants us to dig deeper, but I'm not sure what she's getting at or what she hopes to find, maybe it's something about the old mansion on the hill, or the strange occurrences that have been happening in town lately, or maybe it's something entirely different, but I think we should at least try to investigate further and see if we can uncover any clues that might shed some light on the situation"
“Just that I can understand this woman’s interest in exploring the fact of you and Dave both coming from Nowheresville and blossoming,in the middle of your lives.” I raised my hands beside my head as if framing a headline. “Could it be… fate?”,"that you both ended up in the same city, working at the same company, and somehow managed to avoid each other",44,"that you both ended up in the same city, working at the same company, and somehow managed to avoid each other for so long, only to collide in a small café on a typical Monday morning.

Her words hung in the air, and I found myself pondering the same question, wondering if it was the familiarity of the place, the comfort of routine, or something more profound, something that spoke to the human desire for connection and belonging."
"So that was what I did, although something about the way Pop looked just then stuck with me. It was the look of a man who could say quite","a lot on the subject of how he and his friend Butch had achieved fame and fortune… but who chose not to.

I pushed the thought aside, telling myself I was reading too much into it, but the image lingered in my mind long after I'd left the room. It wasn't until later, when I was going over the events of the day in my head, that I realized what it was about Pop's expression that had really caught my attention - it was the way he'd glanced at me, just for a split second, before quickly looking away. It was a look that seemed to say, ""I'm not telling you something, but I'm not sure I'm supposed to be keeping it a secret either."" I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, and I found myself wondering what it could be."

It wasn't until they were in their early twenties that they reconnected, both having returned to their hometown after college, and it was as if no time had passed at all. They would meet up regularly, swapping stories and laughter, and reminiscing about the good old days. But beneath the surface, Alden sensed a change in his friend, a restlessness that he couldn't quite put his finger on. It wasn't until they were out on a fishing trip, sitting on the riverbank, watching the sun set behind the trees, that his friend finally opened up about what was really going on in his life."
"I read a review of Pop’s first book, The Lightning Storm, and the reviewer said this: “Not much happens in the","first hundred or so pages of Mr. Carmody’s suspenseful yarn, but the reader is drawn on anyway, because there are violins.”","first hundred pages, but when it does, it's explosive.

The author's use of language is vivid and evocative, painting a picture of a small town on the brink of chaos. The characters are well-developed and complex, with Pop's protagonist, Jack, being a particularly intriguing figure. His struggles with his past and his relationships with the people around him are deeply relatable and add a layer of depth to the story. As the plot thickens, the tension builds and the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The themes of love, loss, and redemption are woven throughout the narrative, making for a compelling and thought-provoking read. Overall, I would highly recommend The Lightning Storm to fans of literary fiction and anyone looking for a story that will keep them on the edge of their seat."
"I knew a lot of this. I learned more from Ruth Crawford herself at the Korner Koffee Kup, across the street from the Gateway Motel and just about a block down from the post office. That’s where Pop got his mail,","and there was usually a pretty damn good budget of it. I always stopped at the Koffee Kup after grabbing the post.

I'd sit there with him sometimes, listening intently as she spoke of far-off lands and exotic cultures, her eyes sparkling with a fire that seemed to ignite a sense of wonder in everyone around her. It was there that I first heard tales of the mysterious stranger who'd walked into the Korner Koffee Kup one rainy night, a man with a worn leather jacket and a gaze that seemed to hold a thousand secrets. Ruth had been taken by him, and I could see why - there was something about him that drew people in, like a moth to a flame. But as the years went by, the stranger became a legend, a whispered rumor of a man who'd left as suddenly as he'd arrived, leaving behind only a hint of his presence and a trail of unanswered questions. I'd often wonder what had become of him, and whether he'd ever return to the Korner Koffee Kup, where Ruth still sat, sipping her coffee and spinning tales of the world beyond our small town."

The warm sun on her skin and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore were a balm to her soul, and she felt her worries slowly melting away. She had rented a small cottage on the outskirts of the island, surrounded by lush greenery and a garden full of exotic flowers, and she spent her days exploring the island, capturing its beauty through her lens. It was a decision she had made impulsively, but it was one she knew she would never regret."

He also said that Dave would often practice by eating an entire pizza by himself in one sitting, just to build up his endurance. Your father would often joke that Dave's stomach was like a bottomless pit, and that's why he was able to consume so many pies in such a short amount of time.

She looked up at the house, and for a moment, I thought I saw a flicker of something in her eyes, a spark of curiosity or maybe even a hint of trepidation.

My grandfather, on the other hand, swore that he was the one who had done the actual work, and that Butch's grandfather had only provided the materials. As we sat around the fireplace, swapping stories and sharing laughter, it was clear that the debate would never be settled. Butch's eyes sparkled with mischief as he began to spin a tale of how his grandfather had outdone my grandfather in a series of wits and cunning, culminating in a wild goose chase through the woods that ended with them both tumbling into a nearby stream. My grandfather, never one to be outdone, countered with a story of his own, claiming that he had outsmarted Butch's grandfather in a game of cards, and that the old man had been forced to concede defeat. The argument continued back and forth, each of us trying to one-up the other with tales of our grandfathers' exploits, until finally, we all collapsed in a fit of laughter, exhausted but exhilarated by the sheer joy of it all. As the night wore on, the fire crackled and spat, casting flickering shadows on the walls of the cabin, and we sat there, lost in the warmth and camaraderie of the moment, our differences forgotten in the face of our shared history and our love for the land and the memories that it held. The stars twinkled outside, a celestial showcase of light and sound, and we felt small but connected to the vast expanse of the universe, our little cabin a tiny but vital part of the grand tapestry of life. It was moments like these that I cherished, moments that reminded me of the beauty and wonder of the world, and the power of friendship and family to transcend even the smallest of disputes. As I looked over at Butch, I could see the same thoughts reflected in his eyes, and I knew that we were both thinking the same thing: that this was what it meant to be a part of this place, to be a part of this family, and to be a part of each other's lives. And as we sat there, surrounded by the silence of the forest, I knew that I would never forget this moment, this feeling of being connected to something greater than myself, something that went beyond the boundaries of time and space. It was a feeling that I would carry with me for the rest of my life, a reminder of the beauty and wonder of the world, and the power of friendship and family to bring us all together. The night wore on, and eventually, we drifted off to sleep, lulled by the sound of the wind rustling through the trees, and the distant howl of a wolf in the distance. It was a sound that sent shivers down my spine, but it was also a sound that filled me with a sense of awe and wonder, a reminder of the wild and untamed beauty of the world, and the magic that lay just beyond the edge of our little cabin. As I fell asleep, I felt a sense of peace wash over me, a sense of belonging to this place, and to the people who had come before me. I knew that I would always be a part of this land, and that it would always be a part of me, a part of my soul. And as I drifted off into the darkness, I knew that I would return to this place, to this cabin, and to the memories that it held, again and again, for the rest of my life. The memories of that night, of the laughter and the stories, of the arguments and the camaraderie, would stay with me forever, a reminder of the power of friendship and family to bring us all together, and to make us feel like we are a part of something greater than ourselves. And as I slept, I knew that I would always cherish this place, this cabin, and the memories that it held, and that I would always be grateful for the time that I had spent here, surrounded by the people and the land that I loved. The next morning, we woke up early, feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, and we set out into the woods, ready to face whatever adventures lay ahead. We spent the day hiking through the forest, taking in the sights and sounds of the natural world, and marveling at the beauty of the landscape. As we walked, we talked about our plans for the future, and what we wanted to achieve in life. We talked about our dreams and our aspirations, and we supported each other, offering words of encouragement and advice. It was a day filled with laughter and joy, and it was a day that I would always treasure. As the sun began to set, we made our way back to the cabin, tired but"

He was always so calm and collected in situations like that, and it was one of the things I admired most about him. As I watched him expertly secure the tarp over NellyBelle, I couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude for his leadership and quick thinking. We'd been friends for years, and I'd seen him in all sorts of situations, but moments like these reminded me of why I valued our friendship so much."
"The next day we ate a picnic lunch in the clearing, looking across the creek—which was more like a river that day—at NellyBelle. Butch made sandwiches, which","he could be trusted to do.

As we sat down to eat, Butch pulled out a small, worn-out harmonica from his pocket and began to play a lively tune, which Emma and I joined in with our own makeshift instruments – a spoon and a wooden spoon – creating an impromptu band that filled the air with joy and laughter. Meanwhile, NellyBelle stood quietly by the creek, her ears perked up, as if listening to the music, her tail wagging gently in time with the beat. The sound of the harmonica and our makeshift instruments blended with the chirping of birds and the gentle gurgling of the creek, creating a symphony that was both carefree and enchanting. As we finished our lunch, Butch put away his harmonica, and we all sat in comfortable silence, taking in the beauty of our surroundings, feeling grateful for this moment of tranquility in the midst of our adventure."

He'd nod along, scribbling notes on a pad of paper, but I could tell he wasn't really listening. I was just another number to him, another student to be pushed through the system. I played the game, though, and managed to land a decent job after graduation. But the guilt and anxiety lingered, a constant reminder that I hadn't earned my success. It wasn't until years later, when I was well into my career, that I realized the damage that my actions had caused. I'd been so focused on getting ahead that I'd forgotten the value of hard work and integrity. It was a hard lesson to learn, but one that ultimately made me a better person. I began to speak out about my experiences, hoping to warn others about the dangers of academic dishonesty and the importance of doing things the right way. It wasn't easy, but it was necessary. I'd been given a second chance, and I was determined to make the most of it. I started volunteering at a local high school, working with students who were struggling to navigate the same system that I'd exploited. It was a small step, but it was a start. And as I looked out at the sea of eager faces, I knew that I'd finally found my true calling. I was no longer just a product of the system; I was a force for change. And that was a feeling unlike any other."
"It’s a bad dream. Danny’s had a few before, everyone has a nightmare from time to time, but this is the worst one ever.

The moonlight is shining through the window, casting an ethereal glow on the walls, and the shadows dance across the floor in a soothing rhythm. Danny's face is relaxed, his breathing steady, and his chest rises and falls with a calm regularity. But as he continues to observe, he starts to feel a growing sense of unease, a creeping sense that something is off, that this tranquility is just a facade, a thin veil hiding a dark reality that's waiting to pounce. He tries to shake off the feeling, to tell himself it's just a dream, but it only seems to intensify, until he's convinced that he's trapped in a waking nightmare, unable to wake up, unable to escape the suffocating sense of dread that's closing in around him."
He’s walking along the shoulder of a dirt road that’s been packed and oiled to keep the dust down. It’s night. A quarter moon has just risen. To Danny it looks like a sideways grin. Or a sneer.

He's been walking for hours, the rhythmic crunch of his boots on the gravel road the only sound breaking the silence. The air is cool and crisp, carrying the scent of damp earth and the distant hint of smoke from a chimney. As he rounds a bend in the road, he catches sight of a figure standing in the distance, silhouetted against the moonlit sky. It's a woman, her long hair blowing in the gentle breeze, her eyes fixed intently on Danny as he approaches. He can't quite make out her features, but there's something about her that seems familiar, something that sends a shiver down his spine. He quickens his pace, his heart beating slightly faster as he tries to place her face."
"There’s corn on both sides of the road, not as high as an elephant’s eye but maybe four feet, suggesting it’s early summer.

Danny chuckles to himself, remembering the countless afternoons he spent playing in the fields with his friends, chasing after sticks and dodging the occasional snapping dog. He looks up at the sky, taking in the vast expanse of blue above, and feels a pang of nostalgia for the simple life he left behind. The dog, still sniffing around the truck, suddenly lets out a high-pitched bark and runs off towards the nearby woods, its owner, an old man with a bushy white beard, shouting after it in a gruff voice.

The objects will become a constant reminder of their foolish decision, a constant presence that will haunt them until they return what's rightfully mine. And even then, the damage will have been done, the memories of what they've experienced will linger, a scar that will never fully heal. So, I ask you again, are you sure you want to take that risk?"

On Saturday morning he packs his dinnerbucket with a couple of sandwiches and a piece of the cake Becky brought over after he wired up the tailpipe of her old Honda Civic.

The sound of birds chirping and leaves rustling in the gentle breeze accompanies him as he walks, the rhythmic motion of his footsteps a soothing melody that calms his nerves. He thinks about the upcoming weekend, and the plans he has with his friends, including a camping trip to the nearby lake, and a barbecue at Becky's house, where he hopes to finally get to know her better, and maybe even confess his feelings to her. As he walks, the trees grow taller and the path becomes narrower, the canopy above him growing thicker, casting dappled shadows on the ground below, and he feels a sense of peace wash over him, a sense of freedom and release that he hasn't felt in a long time."

The town is nothing but a grocery store, a farm supply store, a café, and a rusty water tower with GUNNEL","on the side. Ten minutes after leaving it, he comes to County Road F and turns onto it.

The sign above the café reads ""Gunnel's Best Coffee"" in faded letters, and the smell of freshly brewed coffee wafts out into the air, enticing him to come inside. He takes a deep breath, feeling a sense of trepidation mixed with curiosity, and begins to walk towards the café, his boots kicking up small clouds of dust with each step. The figure on the porch looks up and nods at him, but doesn't smile, and he wonders what brings him to this small, unassuming town in the middle of nowhere."

The trees seem to close in around him, their branches tangling overhead like skeletal fingers, casting the interior of the car in a dim, eerie light. Danny's eyes flicker to the rearview mirror, half-expecting to see someone following him, but the road behind is empty. He shakes his head, chuckling wryly to himself - he's starting to get spooked.

He looks around again, this time more carefully, his eyes scanning the surrounding area for any sign of movement.

I took it and left, feeling a bit puzzled but also slightly amused by the whole exchange. As I walked out of the store, I couldn't help but wonder what was so special about this particular item that made Mr. Lee go out of his way to give me a free bag. Was it the cash payment, or was there something more to it? I decided to ask around, but no one seemed to know anything about it. It wasn't until I got home and started researching online that I stumbled upon a small community of collectors who were obsessed with the very same item I had just purchased. They were a secretive group, but their passion and dedication to their hobby were undeniable. I found myself getting drawn into their world, and before I knew it, I was hooked."
“Just this one time!” Jalbert is trying to sound amazed. His eyes aren’t,amazed. They crawl back and forth across Danny’s face. They almost have weight. “One!”,"convincingly wide with excitement, but his voice betrays a hint of desperation as he gazes",27,"convincingly wide with excitement, but his voice betrays a hint of desperation as he gazes at the old, mysterious-looking door hidden behind the dusty bookshelf in the attic of his family's antique mansion."

"“Good luck getting someone to okay paying that,” Jalbert says. “Bureaucracy.”","The pegs of his teeth wink, then disappear. “But you can try.”","The city council has been notoriously slow to approve new projects,",23,"The city council has been notoriously slow to approve new projects, and the mayor's office is notorious for being even more difficult to navigate, with multiple layers of red tape and endless meetings that drag on for weeks, if not months, before anything gets done, and even then, it's often watered down to the point of being almost meaningless, so it's no wonder that Jalbert is skeptical about getting the funding approved, especially when it comes to something as ambitious as a new community center, which would require a significant investment of time and resources, not to mention the potential backlash from local residents who might be opposed to the idea of a new development in their neighborhood, and Jalbert knows that the city's history of broken promises and failed initiatives has eroded trust with the community, making it even harder to get anything done, and he's not sure if it's even worth the effort, but he's determined to try, for the sake of the people who would benefit from the center, and for the sake of his own reputation as a champion of social justice, which is why he's willing to take on the challenge, no matter how daunting it may seem."

As he walks away, he can't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him, remembering the late-night drives, the road trips, and the memories they've created together. He pauses for a moment, his hand still resting on the car's door handle, before turning back to his room, the sound of the wind rustling through the trees the only sound breaking the silence. The sun is beginning to set, casting a warm orange glow over the landscape, and Jalbert can't help but feel a sense of restlessness, a feeling that he's been putting off something important, something that's been lingering in the back of his mind for weeks. He takes a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling, but it only seems to intensify, and he finds himself wondering what it is that's been holding him back, what it is that's been keeping him from taking the leap. The sound of his phone buzzing in his pocket breaks the spell, and he pulls it out, his eyes scanning the screen for any sign of what's been calling to him, but all he sees is a text from an unknown number, a single sentence that reads: ""Meet me at the old oak at midnight."""
