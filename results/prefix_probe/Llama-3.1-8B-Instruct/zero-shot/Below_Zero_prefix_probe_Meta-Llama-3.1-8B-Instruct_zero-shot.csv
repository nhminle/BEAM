"Aside from Eager Beaver, there are fourteen of us starting today. Fourteen of us fresh out of top-five graduate programs, and prestigious internships, and CV-beefing industry","jobs accepted exclusively to look more attractive during NASA’s next round of recruitment. There’re fourteen of us, and the thirteen that aren’t me are all nodding enthusiastically.",53,"with a combined total of over 50 years of work experience, and a collective salary range of $150,000 to $250,000 per year, we are the crème de la crème of the industry, or so we thought. As we stepped off the elevator on the 23rd floor, we were greeted by the CEO, a middle-aged man with a firm handshake and a warm smile, who welcomed us to our new home at Smith and Co., a company known for its innovative approach to software development and cutting-edge technology. We were led to a conference room where a PowerPoint presentation was already set up, and a young woman with a bright smile and a confident demeanor stood at the front of the room, ready to brief us on the company's history, mission, and expectations. As we took our seats, I couldn't help but notice the mix of excitement and nervousness in the air, and I wondered what the next few months had in store for us."
"The truth, though, is quite the opposite. I hated school at first sight—with the direct consequence that school hated the sullen, listless child that I was right back. In the first grade, I refused to learn how to write my name, even though Hannah is only three letters repeated twice. In junior high, I set a school record for the highest number of consecutive detention days—what happens when","you decide to take a stand and not do homework for any of your classes because they are too boring, too difficult, too useless, or all of the above. Until the end of my sophomore year, I couldn’t wait to graduate and leave all of school behind: the books, the teachers, the grades, the cliques. Everything. I didn’t really have a plan for after, except for leaving now behind.",137,"when a student consistently fails to complete their homework, disrupts class, and refuses to follow the rules. My teachers would often try to reason with me, but I was too far gone, lost in a world of my own making. I would scribble in the margins of my notebook, drawing fantastical creatures and cities, anything to avoid the drudgery of learning. My parents were at a loss for what to do, and my grades suffered as a result. I was a constant source of frustration for my teachers, and I could tell they were starting to give up on me. But little did they know, something was brewing inside me, a spark of creativity that would one day ignite and change everything. I just didn't know it yet. As the years went by, I continued to struggle in school, but I was also secretly devouring books from the library, anything I could get my hands on. I was especially drawn to science fiction and fantasy, worlds that were far more exciting than the one I was living in. I devoured the works of Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and Isaac Asimov, and I began to see the world in a different light. I started to dream of far-off planets and distant galaxies, of robots and spaceships, and I knew that I wanted to be a part of that world. I wanted to create worlds of my own, to bring my imagination to life. And so, I began to write, pouring my thoughts and ideas onto paper, creating stories that were full of wonder and magic. It was a slow process, but I was determined to make it happen, to turn my passion into a career. And as I looked back on my time in school, I realized that it wasn't a waste after all. It was a necessary step, a stepping stone to the life I was meant to lead. I was a rebel, a nonconformist, and I was proud of it. I had found my voice, and I was ready to make my mark on the world."
"“It’s like space is your whole personality,” the girl I casually hooked up with during most of my sophomore year of undergrad told me. It was after I explained that no, thank you, I wasn’t interested in going out for coffee to meet her friends because of a lecture on","Kalpana Chawla I was planning to attend. “Do you have any other interests?” she asked. I threw her a quick “Nope,” waved good-bye, and wasn’t too surprised when, the following week, she didn’t reply to my offer to meet up. After all, I clearly couldn’t give her what she wanted.",100,"The existential implications of the human condition and how it relates to our place in the universe. She listened intently, her eyes sparkling with a mix of curiosity and amusement, as I waxed poetic about the inherent meaninglessness of life and how it's up to each individual to create their own purpose. She nodded along, her long brown hair bobbing with each movement, and I could sense a glimmer of understanding in her eyes, but also a hint of confusion, as if she wasn't quite sure what to make of me. I didn't blame her, really – I was still figuring it out myself. We stood there for a moment, the sounds of the campus fading into the background as we lost ourselves in the vast expanse of the conversation. It was one of those moments that felt like it could go either way – a fleeting connection or a deep and meaningful friendship – and I was eager to see which path it would take. As we stood there, the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the quad, and I felt a sense of calm wash over me, a sense of belonging in this moment, in this place, with this person. But as the silence stretched on, I knew I had to break it, to say something, anything, to keep the conversation going. I opened my mouth to speak, but before I could get a word out, she beat me to it. ""So, what do you think is the meaning of life?"" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper, and I felt my heart skip a beat as I realized that this was it – this was the moment that would define our encounter, and possibly our lives. I took a deep breath, and began to speak, my words spilling out in a rush as I tried to distill the essence of my thoughts into something coherent and meaningful. But as I spoke, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was just making it up as I went along, that I was winging it, and that she was watching me with a critical eye, waiting for me to trip up, to reveal my true self. And yet, as I looked into her eyes, I saw something there that gave me hope – a glimmer of understanding, a spark of connection – and I knew that I had to keep going, no matter what. I spoke of the beauty of impermanence, of the fleeting nature of life and how it's up to each of us to make the most of the time we have. I spoke of the importance of human connection, of the need to reach out and touch others, to form bonds that transcend the mundane and the ordinary. And as I spoke, I felt a sense of freedom, a sense of release, as if I was unshackling myself from the constraints of my own doubts and fears. I spoke of the universe, of the vast expanse of space and time, and how it's up to each of us to find our place within it. And as I finished speaking, I felt a sense of satisfaction, a sense of completion, as if I had finally found my voice, my purpose. The girl listened intently, her eyes never leaving mine, and for a moment, I thought I saw a glimmer of tears, a hint of emotion, but it was quickly replaced by a smile, a warm and genuine smile that made my heart skip a beat. And in that moment, I knew that this was it – this was the start of something special, something that would change my life forever. But as the moment passed, and the silence returned, I couldn't help but wonder – had I just made a fool of myself, or had I truly connected with this person, this girl who had captured my heart in a single glance? Only time would tell, but for now, I was content to bask in the glow of the moment, to let the uncertainty wash over me like a wave, and to see where it would take me. As we stood there, the stars beginning to twinkle in the night sky, I knew that I had to ask her out on a proper date, to see if this connection was more than just a fleeting moment of connection. I took a deep breath, and asked her, my heart pounding in my chest, and to my surprise, she said yes. And as we walked off into the night, hand in hand, I knew that this was just the beginning of an adventure that would take me to places I never thought possible. The universe had given me a gift, a chance to connect with someone special, and I was determined to make the most of it. Little did I know, this was just the start of a journey that would take me to the farthest reaches of the cosmos, and back again, in search of the meaning of life, and the secrets of the universe. And as we walked, the stars shining brightly above us,"
"“Yeah, I’m not sure.” She shrugs and continues to make her way through a Tupperware of broccoli, an apple, and approximately two fucktons of Cheez-Its. “I don’t really know much about him. His parents divorced, then people in my family had arguments and stopped talking to each other. There was a lot of","prime Floyd dysfunction happening, so I haven’t actually spoken to him in years. But I heard from one of my other cousins that he was working on that thing that landed on Mars back when we were in high school. It was called something like . . . Contingency, or Carpentry, or Crudity—”",106,"silence and resentment that still lingers to this day. I remember my grandmother would always say that family gatherings were never the same after that, and how my grandfather would get quiet and withdrawn whenever his ex-wife's name was mentioned. It was like a dark cloud hung over us, casting a shadow on every celebration and holiday. I never really understood the depth of it all, but I knew it was something that needed to be addressed. My mom would try to fill the void with food, and that's why I think she's always had a stash of snacks like this Tupperware, a reminder of happier times when family was still close. But now, as I watch her rummage through it, I see the pain and sadness in her eyes, and I wonder if I'll ever be able to help her heal. The thought of it all is overwhelming, and I'm not sure where to start. I take a deep breath and try to focus on the present, on the simple act of eating and being together, but it's hard to shake off the feeling that there's so much more to this story, so much more to our family's history, that I'm not aware of."
"“I think so. Do the dates add up? Maybe it was some kind of summer internship? But honestly, it might just be Floyd family lore. I have an aunt who insists that we’re related to","the Finnish royals, and according to Wikipedia there are no Finnish royals. So.” She shrugs and pops another handful of Cheez-Its in her mouth. “Would you like me to ask around, though? For the assignment?”",70,"some famous historical figure, but I've never been able to verify it. I've always been skeptical, but it's possible that our family's history is more complicated than we think. I mean, think about it - if we were related to someone famous, it would explain why our family's always been so interested in politics and public service. My grandmother used to say that our ancestors were known for their strong sense of justice and their commitment to making a difference in the world. It's a nice idea, but I've never been able to find any concrete evidence to support it. Still, it's an intriguing possibility, and I think it's worth exploring further. I'll have to dig through some old family records and see if I can turn up anything interesting. Maybe I'll even discover a long-lost relative or two along the way."
"“By the way, I sent you my cousin-or-something’s contact info a while ago,” Mara tells me one night. We’re at the",cheapest grad bar we’ve been able to find. She’s on her second Midori sour of the night. “Did you get it?”,42,"completion> dinner party at my place, surrounded by the faint scent of old books and the soft hum of jazz music. I vaguely remember receiving a text from her, but I must have deleted it without reading it. I try to recall the name she mentioned, but it's on the tip of my tongue, just out of reach. ""Who's that?"" I ask, taking a sip of my wine. Mara leans in, a mischievous glint in her eye. ""You know, my cousin's daughter, Sophia. She's a writer, and she's been looking for someone to collaborate with on a project. I thought you two might hit it off."" I raise an eyebrow, intrigued despite myself. ""What kind of project?"" Mara smiles, her eyes sparkling with excitement. ""A novel, actually. She's been working on it for years, but she's stuck. I think you could help her break through the block."" I consider this for a moment, weighing the pros and cons. On the one hand, I've always been drawn to creative projects, and the idea of working with a fellow writer is appealing. On the other hand, I'm not sure I'm ready to commit to anything that serious. But as I look at Mara, I can see the hope in her eyes, and I know I have to at least consider it. ""Okay, sure,"" I say finally. ""I'll meet with her."" Mara grins, relief washing over her face. ""I'll set it up for next week. I'm sure you two will get along great."" I nod, feeling a sense of trepidation mixed with excitement. What have I just gotten myself into?"
"He frowns, as if momentarily blanking on Mara’s name. “Ah, yes.” He nods. Only once. “Apparently,” he adds, which makes me laugh. He waits for me to take a seat","across from him before folding back in his chair. I notice that he doesn’t hold out his hand, nor does he smile. Interesting. “Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.”",61,"before he begins to explain, his eyes drifting off to the side as if searching for the right words, ""Mara is a... complicated person,"" he says finally, his voice measured, ""her past is shrouded in mystery, and I'm not just talking about the usual small-town gossip, but actual, verifiable facts that are difficult to come by."" He pauses, studying me intently, as if gauging my reaction, before continuing, ""She's been known to be fiercely independent, some might even say stubborn, but there's a depth to her that I've only begun to scratch the surface of, and I'm not sure I fully understand her motivations, or what drives her to do the things she does."" His words trail off, leaving me with more questions than answers, and a growing sense of unease about what I'm getting myself into."
"“Officially: unclear. But I’m fairly sure my brother made CDs of it. Sent them to local TV stations and whatnot.” He gestures vaguely, and his forearm is dusted with freckles and pale-red hair. I want to grab his wrist, hold it in front","of my eyes, study it at my leisure. Trace, smell, touch. “I haven’t spent a holiday with the Floyd side of the family in twenty years, but I’m told that the video is a source of great entertainment for all age groups at Thanksgiving.”",87,"The wrist, with its smattering of freckles and the faint red hairs that seemed to glow in the dim light of the diner, and ask him to explain, but my hands are still wrapped around my coffee cup, and I'm not sure I'm ready to let go of the warmth it provides. He leans back in his chair, a faraway look in his eyes, and I can tell he's reliving a memory, one that's been replaying in his head for years. ""I remember the day he recorded it,"" he says, his voice barely above a whisper, ""he was so excited, talking about how it was going to change everything. But it never did, of course. It just sort of...faded away."" He trails off, lost in thought, and I'm left wondering what exactly he's talking about, and what this mysterious recording could have been."
"The section is in C++. Which happens to be the very first language I taught myself back in high school, when every single Google search for “Skills + Necessary + NASA” led to the sad result of “Programming.” Python came after. Then SQL. Then HAL/S. For each language, I started out convinced that chewing on","glass would surely be preferable. Then, at some point along the way, I began thinking in terms of functions, variables, conditional loops. A little after that, reading code became a bit like inspecting the label on the back of the conditioner bottle while showering: not particularly fun, but overall easy. I do have some talents, apparently.",111,"chewing on the syntax would somehow magically make it stick in my brain. But it never did. I'd spend hours staring at lines of code, trying to decipher the logic behind each line, only to end up with a headache and a faint sense of accomplishment. It wasn't until I stumbled upon a coding community online that things started to click. The forums, the tutorials, the endless discussions – it all seemed to make sense, and I found myself devouring every piece of information I could get my hands on. I spent countless nights coding, experimenting, and pushing the limits of what I thought was possible. And slowly but surely, the languages began to make sense. C++ became second nature, Python a breeze, and SQL a tool I could wield with precision. But it wasn't until I started working on personal projects that I truly understood the power of coding. I built a website, a mobile app, and even a simple game, each one teaching me something new and exciting. The more I coded, the more I realized that it wasn't just about writing lines of code – it was about solving problems, creating something from nothing, and bringing ideas to life. And that's when the real magic happened. I started to see the world in a different light, as a place where code and creativity collided, and the possibilities seemed endless. I began to see myself as a problem-solver, a maker, and a creator, and that's when I knew that I had truly found my calling. The journey was far from over, but I was excited to see where this new path would take me, and I knew that no matter what lay ahead, I would be ready, armed with the skills and the passion to tackle anything that came my way."
"My heart rate picks up. Warmth twists in my lower stomach. I lean forward with a smile, feeling like I’m finally in my element. This, this, is what I know best. Depending on how busy I am with school, or work, or binge-watching K-dramas,","I do this about once a week. Which amounts to quite a bit of practice. “Maybe I could come to your place?” I say, finding the sweet spot between comically suggestive and Let’s get together to play Cards Against Humanity. “And you could show me?”",89,"it's the one thing that always brings me a sense of calm and clarity. I take a deep breath, letting the familiar scent of freshly brewed coffee envelop me, and begin to expertly craft each shot with precision and care. The hiss of the steam wand, the gentle gurgling of the espresso machine, it's music to my ears. As I work, my mind starts to wander, and I find myself lost in thought, replaying memories of my favorite K-dramas, and the characters that have become like second family to me. I think about the way Lee Min-Ho's character in ""The Heirs"" always knew exactly what to say to make his friends feel better, and how it's something I've always aspired to do for those around me. The more I work, the more my thoughts become a jumbled mess, but in a good way, like a puzzle that's slowly coming together. I'm in my happy place, and nothing else matters."
"It sends me right over the edge. Into something that’s nothing like my usual, run-of-the-mill orgasm. Those tend to start like small fractures and then slowly, gradually deepen into something lovely and relaxing. Those are fun, good fun, but this . . . This pleasure is sudden and violent.

It's exhilarating and terrifying, a rollercoaster ride of emotions that leaves me breathless and wanting more. I'm not sure if I'm ready for this, but I know I'm not going to stop. I'm going to ride this wave, no matter where it takes me, and see where it leads. The pleasure is intense, almost overwhelming, and I'm not sure if I can handle it. But I'm going to try, because the alternative is to stop, and I don't think I can do that. I'm too far gone, too caught up in the moment, to turn back now. So I'll just let go, and see where this wild ride takes me. And when it's all over, I'll pick up the pieces and try to make sense of it all.

The sound of the door closing behind him snaps me back to reality, and I'm left standing alone in the empty hallway, my mind racing with thoughts of what could have been. I take a deep breath and try to shake off the feeling of disappointment, telling myself that it's not the end of the world, but as I turn to head back to my room, I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and see a look of longing on my face, a look that I quickly try to hide, but can't quite conceal. I feel a pang of regret for not speaking up, for not telling him how I really felt, and I wonder if I'll ever be able to let go of the what-ifs that are now swirling in my head. As I make my way back to my room, I'm met with the familiar sight of my bed, but it looks different now, like a reminder of the emptiness that's been left inside me. I try to distract myself by thinking about all the things I need to do before the weekend, but my mind keeps wandering back to him, and the way he smiled at me, and the way he made me feel like I was the only person in the world.

I'm grateful for the distraction, but I can tell she's not convinced by my earlier response. I wonder if she's starting to suspect that something is off, and I'm not sure how to rectify the situation.

"It is. AMASE is the shit, and the selection process to take part in an expedition was brutal, to the point that I’m not quite sure how I made it in. Probably sheer luck: Dr. Merel, one of the expedition leaders, was looking","for someone with experience in gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. Which I happen to have, due to some side projects my Ph.D. advisor foisted upon me. At the time, I aggressively bitched and moaned my way through them. In hindsight, I feel a bit guilty.",86,"looking for someone with a background in geology, and I happened to have a degree in that field, which I hadn't even used in years. But, as it turned out, that was exactly what they needed. The team was comprised of experts from various fields - biologists, physicists, engineers, and even a linguist - all brought together to explore the remote and largely uncharted regions of the Amazon rainforest. Our mission was to uncover the secrets of a long-abandoned city deep in the jungle, a place rumored to hold the key to understanding the ancient civilizations that once thrived there. The team was led by Dr. Merel and Dr. Rodriguez, a renowned archaeologist with a passion for uncovering the mysteries of the past. As we set out on our journey, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and trepidation - what would we find, and what challenges would we face along the way? The dense foliage seemed to close in around us as we trekked deeper into the jungle, the sounds of the rainforest growing louder with every step. We had been warned about the dangers of the jungle, from venomous snakes and spiders to the harsh climate and treacherous terrain, but nothing could have prepared us for the reality of it all. As we pushed forward, the air grew thick with humidity and the sounds of the jungle grew more intense, a cacophony of birdsong, howling monkeys, and the distant rumble of a waterfall. It was a truly immersive experience, and one that I would never forget. But, as we journeyed deeper into the heart of the jungle, we began to realize that we were not alone. The team had been tracking a strange energy signature for days, and we were starting to suspect that it was coming from the very heart of the abandoned city itself. We exchanged nervous glances, our hearts racing with anticipation and fear - what would we find when we finally reached the source of the energy? The anticipation was palpable as we pressed on, our senses on high alert for any sign of what lay ahead. And then, suddenly, we stumbled upon it - a massive stone structure, hidden deep within the jungle, its entrance guarded by two imposing stone statues. The air seemed to vibrate with an otherworldly energy, and I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end. We approached the entrance cautiously, our hearts pounding in our chests, and peered into the darkness within. What we saw took our breath away - a vast, cavernous space filled with ancient artifacts and mysterious devices, a testament to the ingenuity and knowledge of the long-lost civilization that once thrived here. It was a moment of pure awe, and one that would change our understanding of history forever. But, as we delved deeper into the heart of the city, we began to realize that we were not the only ones who had discovered this place. There were signs of recent occupation, and we soon stumbled upon a group of individuals who had been living here for years, hiding in plain sight. They were a reclusive and enigmatic group, and they seemed to be watching us with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. We tried to communicate with them, but they seemed reluctant to engage, and we were left with more questions than answers. As we continued to explore the city, we began to uncover clues that suggested a much larger conspiracy, one that went far beyond the confines of the jungle. It was a revelation that would shake the very foundations of our understanding of the world, and one that would leave us questioning everything we thought we knew about the past. The journey had just begun, and we were about to uncover secrets that would change our lives forever. As we delved deeper into the heart of the city, the air grew thick with an otherworldly energy, and I couldn't shake the feeling that we were being watched. The team was on high alert, their senses heightened as they scanned the surroundings for any sign of danger. And then, without warning, everything went black. The next thing I knew, I was waking up in a strange, dimly lit room, with no memory of how I got there. I was disoriented and confused, and my head was pounding with a dull ache. As I struggled to sit up, I realized that I was not alone. There was someone else in the room with me, a figure shrouded in shadows. I tried to speak, but my voice was hoarse and barely audible. The figure slowly stepped forward, its features illuminated by a faint light. It was Dr. Merel, but something was off about her. Her eyes seemed different, and her smile was twisted and sinister. I tried to scream, but my voice was trapped in my throat. Dr. Merel leaned in close, her breath cold and rank. ""Welcome to the real purpose of the expedition,"""
"“Did something happen?” Karl, my office mate, asks from across the desk. “You look like","you’re about to cry. Or maybe throw something out of the window, I can’t tell.”",30,"you've seen a ghost. I shake my head, trying to clear the haze from my mind. It's just a side effect of the long hours I've been putting in lately, I tell myself. But the image of the old woman in the coffee shop still lingers in my mind. She was sitting at the small table by the window, sipping on a cup of coffee, when I walked in this morning. At first, I thought she was just another regular, but as I got closer, I noticed something strange. Her eyes seemed to be staring right through me, and her smile was... off. I tried to brush it off as my imagination, but the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that something unusual happened. Karl raises an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced. ""What's going on?"" he asks again, his voice a little louder this time. I take a deep breath and try to explain, but the words get stuck in my throat. How do I tell him about the woman, about the feeling of being watched, about the sense of unease that's been following me all morning?"

I need some time to think about it, and I'd appreciate it if you could give me some space. I'm not sure what the right choice is, but I'll weigh my options carefully and let you know as soon as I've made up my mind. I value our relationship and don't want to rush into anything that might affect it negatively. I'll take a few days to consider everything and then we can discuss it further, okay?"
"As we all know, in early 2010, the rover Spirit became stuck in a sand trap, was unable to reorient its solar panels toward the sun, and froze to death as a consequence of its lack of power. Something very similar happened eight years later to Opportunity, which went into hibernation when a maelstrom blocked sunlight and prevented it from recharging its","batteries. Obviously, the risk of losing control of rovers because of extreme weather events is high. To address this, Dr. Arroyo has designed a promising internal system that is less likely to fail in the case of unpredictable meteorological situations. She proposes to build a model and test its efficacy on the next expedition at the Arctic Mars Analog in Svalbard (AMASE)—",124,"The batteries. Both rovers were designed to survive the harsh Martian environment, but their prolonged exposure to the extreme temperatures and lack of sunlight took a devastating toll on their systems. The Spirit rover, which had been operational for six years, was eventually declared dead in 2011, marking the end of a remarkable journey that had provided invaluable insights into the Martian geology and climate. Opportunity, on the other hand, defied all odds and continued to send back data until 2019, a testament to its incredible resilience and the ingenuity of its engineers. The two rovers had been part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, which aimed to explore the Martian surface and search for signs of water and life. Their discoveries paved the way for future missions, including the Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in 2012 and has been operating successfully ever since. The legacy of Spirit and Opportunity continues to inspire scientists and engineers, who are working tirelessly to push the boundaries of space exploration and uncover the secrets of the Red Planet."
"Dr. Arroyo’s project is a brilliant addition to NASA’s current roster, and it should be approved for further","study. Dr. Arroyo’s vitae is impressive, and she has accumulated enough experience to carry out the proposed work—",36,"development and funding, as it has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of space exploration and the vast mysteries that lie beyond our planet. With its cutting-edge technology and innovative approach, Dr. Arroyo's project is poised to make groundbreaking discoveries that will not only expand our knowledge but also pave the way for future generations of scientists and engineers to continue pushing the boundaries of what is thought to be possible. Furthermore, the project's interdisciplinary approach, combining expertise from various fields such as astrophysics, materials science, and computer engineering, will foster a collaborative environment that encourages creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the universe and our place within it. By investing in Dr. Arroyo's project, NASA will not only be advancing its own research capabilities but also contributing to the global scientific community's pursuit of knowledge and understanding, which is essential for addressing the complex challenges we face in today's interconnected world."
"I met Dr. Merel because he was my direct superior during AMASE, and he is . . . an odd duck, honestly. Very stiff. Very hard-core. NASA is full of ambitious people, but he seems to be almost obsessed with results, publications, the kind of sexy science that makes","big splashy news. Initially I wasn’t a fan, but I must admit that as a supervisor he’s been nothing but supportive. He’s the one who selected me for the expedition to begin with, and he encouraged me to apply for funding once I went to him with my project idea.",99,"gets you ahead in the academic game. He's always pushing us to be faster, to be better, to be more efficient. I've seen him yell at people in meetings, and I've seen him make people cry. But at the same time, he's also incredibly intelligent and has a deep understanding of the subject matter. He's always willing to listen and offer advice, even if it's not what you want to hear. I've learned a lot from him, and I have to admit that I admire his dedication to his work. However, I've also seen the toll it takes on his personal life, and I worry that he's going to burn out eventually. Despite his tough exterior, I think he's a complex person with a lot of depth, and I'm not sure I fully understand him yet. Sometimes I catch him looking at old photos of his family, and for a brief moment, his expression softens, and I see a glimmer of the person behind the scientist. It's a reminder that even the most driven individuals have hearts and families that they care about, and that their work is not just about the science, but also about the people they love. As I reflect on my time working with Dr. Merel, I realize that he's taught me a lot more than just the technical skills I need to succeed in my career. He's taught me about the importance of perseverance, the value of hard work, and the need to balance ambition with compassion and empathy. I'm grateful for the experience, and I'm not sure what the future holds, but I know that I'll always appreciate the lessons I learned from Dr. Merel."
"“Yes. Of course it would have been convenient if you’d had those funds at your disposal, but I’ve already discussed it with two of","my colleagues who agree that your work is meritorious. They are in control of other funds that Floyd won’t be able to veto, so—”",48,"The bank managers, and they've assured me that the loan will be approved within the next 48 hours. In the meantime, I've managed to secure a temporary line of credit that will cover our immediate expenses. However, I must stress that this is only a stopgap measure, and we still need to find a more sustainable solution to our financial woes. I've been in talks with several potential investors, but so far, none of them have been willing to commit to a significant investment. I'm starting to get a bit worried that we might not meet our quarterly targets, and if that happens, it could have serious consequences for the company's future. I've tried to reassure the team that everything will be okay, but I can see the fear in their eyes, and it's starting to get to me as well. I just hope that something changes soon, or we might be facing a very uncertain future."
"“I’ll be there, out in the field with you, of course,” Dr. Merel says. I’m a little surprised. In the months we were in Norway, I saw him do very little sample","collecting and snow plodding. I’ve always thought of him as more of a coordinator. But if he offered, he must mean it, and . . . I smile. “Perfect, then. Thank you.”",64,"collection, and I had assumed he was more of a behind-the-scenes figure. But now, as we're about to embark on this expedition to the remote Amazonian rainforest, he seems eager to get his hands dirty. I watch as he carefully packs his gear, his eyes shining with a mix of excitement and trepidation. ""We'll be tracking a rare species of jaguar,"" he explains, his voice low and serious. ""One that's been spotted only a handful of times in the past decade. The locals call it the 'Ghost Panther'."" He glances at me, his expression intense. ""Are you ready for this?"" I nod, trying to hide my own doubts. We've been planning this expedition for months, but nothing can truly prepare us for the challenges that lie ahead. The dense foliage, the sweltering heat, the unpredictable wildlife – it's a daunting prospect, but I'm determined to see it through. Dr. Merel hands me a map, his fingers brushing against mine as he does so. ""Let's get moving,"" he says, his voice firm. ""We have a long journey ahead of us."" I take a deep breath, shouldering my backpack and following him into the unknown."
"The problems start when he looks up and notices me. He stops exactly two steps below, which should put him at a disadvantage but, depressingly, unfairly, tragically, doesn’t.

He says, “Hannah,” a touch of something in his voice that I recognize but instantly reject, and I have no choice but to acknowledge him.",70,"completion> gaze lingers on me, and for a moment, I'm frozen, unsure of what to do next. His eyes seem to bore into my very soul, and I feel a shiver run down my spine as he takes a step closer, his movements fluid and deliberate. The air around us seems to thicken, heavy with tension, and I can feel the weight of his gaze like a physical force pressing down on me. I try to look away, but my eyes are trapped, unable to break free from the hold he has on me. His face is a mask of calm, but I sense a storm brewing beneath the surface, a storm that threatens to erupt at any moment. I take a step back, trying to create some distance between us, but he mirrors my movement, his eyes never leaving mine. The silence between us is oppressive, a living, breathing entity that pulses with an energy all its own. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest, and my breath comes in short gasps, as if I've been running for miles. I'm trapped, caught in a web of his gaze, and I don't know how to escape."

His","eyes narrow to blue slits and he asks, “It was Merel, wasn’t it?”",26,"silence is deafening, a heavy blanket that suffocates the air between us, as he stares at me with an unreadable expression, his eyes a window to a soul that's been locked away, and I'm left wondering if he's still in there, or if I've finally lost my grip on reality."
"“Because he was there when I explained my objections, at length and in detail. Did he omit that?” I press my lips together. Which he seems to interpret as an opening. “Hannah.” He leans closer. We’re nose to nose, I smell his skin and his aftershave, and I hate every second of this. “Your","project is too dangerous. It specifically asks that you travel to a remote location to drop off equipment at a time of the year in which the weather is volatile and often totally unpredictable.

I try to push him away, but he's too close, his breath warm against my skin. I feel a shiver run down my spine as he reaches out and gently brushes a strand of hair behind my ear. It's a gentle touch, but it sends a spark of electricity through me, and I'm not sure if it's anger or attraction that's making my heart pound. I take a step back, trying to create some distance between us, but he follows, his eyes never leaving mine. ""Hannah, talk to me,"" he urges, his voice low and soothing. I open my mouth to speak, but the words get caught in my throat. I'm not sure what to say, or how to process the emotions swirling inside me. All I know is that I need to get out of here, away from him and his piercing gaze. I turn to leave, but he catches my arm, his grip firm but not painful. ""Wait,"" he says, his voice firm but gentle. ""We're not done talking about this."" I try to shake him off, but he holds tight, his eyes never leaving mine. I feel a surge of frustration and anger, but beneath it, a spark of something else. Something that makes me wonder if I'm reading the situation all wrong. Maybe he's not trying to manipulate me after all. Maybe he's just trying to help. I take a deep breath and try to calm down, to think clearly. But as I look into his eyes, I see something there that makes my heart skip a beat. A glimmer of something real, something true. And I'm not sure if I'm ready for it."

I hold on to him, my fingers digging into the fabric of his shirt, as if I can anchor myself to this moment, to this feeling of being safe and protected. His hand strokes my hair, a gentle, soothing motion that calms the remaining tremors in my body, and I feel my eyelids growing heavy, my breathing slowing, as I let go of the fear and the pain, and let myself be held, let myself be loved."
"“Who is M— Oh. Yeah. For the most part. Mom isn’t very fond of the Floyd side of the family.

I've heard them talking about her behind her back, calling her a hippie and a dreamer, and how she's always been a disappointment to them. But my mom doesn't care, she's always been her own person and has never tried to change who she is to fit in with anyone else's expectations. And I admire her for that, even if it means we don't get to spend as much time with the Floyd side of the family as I would like."

I hesitated, but the prospect of uncovering the truth about the abandoned research facility was too enticing to resist. So, I took a deep breath, shouldered my backpack, and stepped out into the dense forest, the crunch of leaves and snapping of twigs beneath my feet the only sounds breaking the silence. The trees towered above me, their branches creaking ominously in the gentle breeze, casting long, ominous shadows on the ground. I fished out my map and compass, trying to get my bearings, but the dense foliage made it difficult to navigate. I knew I had to move quickly, before nightfall, and find shelter for the night. The thought of spending another night in the open, with no Merel to watch my back, sent a shiver down my spine. I quickened my pace, my heart racing with anticipation and a hint of fear. As I walked, the trees seemed to grow taller and closer, the air thickening with an eerie, unsettling energy. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched, and the silence was starting to unnerve me. Suddenly, I heard a faint rustling in the underbrush, and my heart skipped a beat. I froze, my senses on high alert, wondering if I was truly alone in the forest."

Wow,",I’m mature. “How did you go from not remembering Mara’s name to having her number?”,30,"The conversation trailed off as we both stared out the window, the city lights reflecting off the wet pavement like a million tiny diamonds. I couldn't help but think about how much I had changed since moving here, and how much I still had to learn about myself and this new place.

"“I guess we’ll see. I’m not sure he would want to date,” I say, staring at Sadie’s Froot Loops. The ensuing silence drags on so long,",I’m forced to look up. She and Mara are staring at me like I just announced that I’m quitting my job to take up macramé full-time. “What?”,53,"that I start to wonder if I've said something wrong, but then Sadie finally speaks up, her voice barely above a whisper, ""I know he's been through a lot, but I think he's ready to move on."" I nod in agreement, trying to reassure her, ""Yeah, I think you're right, he deserves to be happy."" The thought of him with someone else is a little strange, but I push the feeling aside, focusing on the present moment, as Sadie continues to eat her cereal, the sound of the milk dripping into the bowl the only noise in the room, until she finally looks up at me and says, ""Do you think he'd like me?"""

But until then, I'm not sure you're ready to hear it. I've seen the way you push people away, the way you build walls around yourself, and I'm not sure I can blame you. You've been hurt before, and it's left its scars. But I want you to know that I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere. I'll wait for you, Hannah, even if it takes a lifetime. I'll wait for the day when you're ready to let someone in, to let them see the real you, the you that you hide from the world.

And I assume sex wasn’t involved.”,24,"are always there for you, but I'm starting to think that's not entirely true. You've been distant lately, and I've noticed you've been spending a lot of time with Emily and Sarah, but not really talking to me about anything that's going on in your life. I know we've been friends for a long time, but I feel like I'm losing you, and it's hard for me to understand why you're pushing me away. Is everything okay? Is there something going on that you're not telling me? I feel like I'm just standing here, watching you slip further and further away, and I don't know how to reach you anymore. I'm starting to wonder if our friendship is just a habit for you, something you do out of obligation rather than because you actually care about me as a person. I know I'm not perfect, but I thought we were better than this, Hannah. I thought we were more than just acquaintances, but now I'm not so sure. I'm scared that I'm losing you, and I don't know how to stop it from happening. Can we talk about this? Can we figure out what's going on and find a way to fix things between us? I don't want to lose you, Hannah, but I feel like I'm running out of time. I'm running out of time to make things right, to make you see that I'm here for you, that I care about you, and that I want to be a part of your life. Please, Hannah, don't push me away. Let's talk about this, let's work through it together, and let's find a way to make our friendship stronger than ever. I'm here for you, Hannah, and I'm not going anywhere. I just wish you would see that, and I wish you would let me in again. I wish you would let me be there for you like I used to be. I wish you would let me be your friend again, Hannah. I wish you would let me be the person you turn to when you need someone to talk to, when you need someone to listen, when you need someone to be there for you.

"“Hannah.” He unbuckles his seat belt and angles himself toward me, so that I have no choice but to look him in the eyes. He looks earnest and nearly offended. “I have thought about what happened in my office every day for the past five years. You offered to go down on me, and I just . . . embarrassed myself, and it should be the most mortifying memory I have, but for some reason it’s turned into the axis every fantasy of mine spins around, and”—he reaches up to pinch the bridge of his nose—“I want to fuck you.","Obviously. Always have. I just don’t want to fuck you once. I want to do it a lot. For a long time. I want you to come to me for sex, but also want you to come to me when you need help with your taxes and moving your furniture. I want fucking to be only one of the million things I do for you, and I want to be—” He stops. Seems to collect himself and straightens, as if to give me space. To give us space. “I’m sorry. I don’t want to crowd you. You can . . .”",201,"“I want to fuck you,” he repeats, his voice low and husky, sending a shiver down my spine. I feel a flutter in my chest, a mix of emotions swirling inside me. Part of me wants to push him away, to tell him that I'm not interested, that I'm still hurt from what happened all those years ago. But another part of me, a part that I've been trying to ignore, is screaming to let go, to give in to the desire that's been building between us for so long. I take a deep breath, trying to calm my racing heart, and look away, trying to gather my thoughts. But his hand on my chin, gently turning my face back to his, makes me feel like I'm trapped, like I'm drowning in the depths of his eyes. “Hannah, please,” he whispers, his voice barely audible, but it sends a shiver down my spine. I feel like I'm melting, like I'm losing control, and I don't know if I can stop it. His eyes are pleading, his face twisted in a mixture of desire and vulnerability, and I feel like I'm the only one who can see it, the only one who can understand what he's going through. I take another deep breath, trying to clear my head, but it's no use. I'm lost, completely and utterly lost in the depths of his eyes, and I don't know how to find my way back. His hand drops from my chin, and he takes a step closer, his face inches from mine, his warm breath on my skin making me shiver. I feel like I'm on the edge of a precipice, staring into the unknown, and I don't know if I'm ready to take the leap. But a part of me, a part that I've been trying to ignore, is screaming to let go, to give in to the desire that's been building between us for so long. I feel like I'm torn, like I'm being pulled in two different directions, and I don't know which way to turn. His eyes are still locked on mine, his face still twisted in a mixture of desire and vulnerability, and I feel like I'm the only one who can see it, the only one who can understand what he's going through. I take another deep breath, trying to calm my racing heart, but it's no use. I'm lost, completely and utterly lost in the depths of his eyes, and I don't know how to find my way back. His hand reaches out, his fingers brushing against mine, sending a spark of electricity through my body. I feel like I'm on fire, like I'm burning from the inside out, and I don't know how to put out the flames. His eyes never leave mine, his face still twisted in a mixture of desire and vulnerability, and I feel like I'm the only one who can see it, the only one who can understand what he's going through. I'm trapped, completely and utterly trapped in the depths of his eyes, and I don't know how to escape. His hand wraps around mine, his fingers intertwining with mine, and I feel like I'm home, like I'm exactly where I'm meant to be.

His hand tightens around mine, his fingers digging deep into my skin, and I feel like I'm being pulled under, like I'm being swept away by a tidal wave of desire. I try to pull away, but his grip is too strong, and I'm trapped, completely and utterly trapped in the depths of his eyes. I feel like I'm drowning, like I'm suffocating under the weight of his gaze, and I don't know how to breathe.

"He laughs, low and beautiful and a little rueful. And after looking at me like no","one else ever has before, what he says is, “Yes, Hannah. It is a yes on dinner.”",33,"one has ever looked at me before, he says, his voice low and husky, and I feel a shiver run down my spine as he takes a step closer, his eyes locked on mine, searching for something, anything, that will give him a clue to the mystery that is me."
"“Um, I could make us a . . .” I scratch my head, studying the contents of my open fridge. Okay, so it’s full. The problem is, it’s full exclusively of stuff that needs to be cooked, chopped, baked, prepared. Stuff that’s healthy and doesn’t taste","particularly good. I am now 93 percent sure that Mara was the one who went shopping, because no one else would dare to impose broccoli on me. “How does one even . . . I could boil the broccoli, I guess? In a pot? With water?”",92,"like cardboard. I glance over at my roommate, who's sitting on the couch, engrossed in her phone. ""Hey, do you have any snacks?"" I ask, hoping she might have something stashed away that I'm not aware of. She looks up, slightly annoyed, and says, ""No, I'm trying to diet, remember?"" I sigh inwardly, knowing I'm not exactly in a position to judge. I continue to rummage through the fridge, searching for something, anything, that might satisfy my sudden craving. Ah, yes, there's a jar of peanut butter in the back. I could make us a peanut butter and banana sandwich, but that's not exactly the most exciting option. And then it hits me - I could make us some smoothies. I grab a few frozen berries from the freezer and start to blend them with some yogurt and a splash of milk. As the blender whirs to life, I start to get a little more creative, adding in some honey and a sprinkle of cinnamon. The aroma that fills the kitchen is amazing, and my stomach growls in anticipation. I pour the smoothies into two glasses and hand one to my roommate, who takes a sip and nods in approval. ""Not bad,"" she says, ""but next time, can you add some protein powder?"" I smile, feeling a sense of accomplishment, and we sit down to enjoy our healthy, if not exactly tasty, snack."
“Hannah.” His forehead touches mine. He laughs against my mouth. “Dinner is . . . it’s symbolic. A,"metaphor. If you tell me that you’re willing to see where things go, I believe you, and we can—”",37,"completion>...a reminder of the memories we've made together, of the laughter, the tears, the late-night conversations, and the quiet moments when it was just us. His warm breath tickles my skin as he pulls back, his eyes sparkling with a mix of amusement and sincerity. ""It's a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, we found our way back to each other,"" he says, his voice low and husky. I nod, feeling a lump form in my throat as I gaze up at him, my heart swelling with emotion. The dim lighting in the room seems to fade away, leaving only the two of us, suspended in this moment of perfect understanding."
"He is hot and huge. Closing his eyes, arching his neck before looking at me again with a half-warning, half-pleading expression. He finds me sitting","on his knees, his cock spasming in my grip as I lean over. “Hannah,” he says, even deeper than usual. “What are you . . .”",51,"The air is thick with tension as he takes a step closer, his massive frame towering over me, and I can feel the heat emanating from his body. His eyes seem to bore into my soul, searching for something, but I'm not sure what. His expression softens ever so slightly, and I sense a hint of vulnerability behind the warning, as if he's unsure of how I'll react to his presence. I remain frozen, unsure of what to do next, my heart pounding in my chest as he continues to regard me with an intensity that's both captivating and intimidating."
“Or maybe it’s the Vastitas Borealis.” He’s barely intelligible. Doing those little thrusts that are designed more to open me up than to,"fuck me properly, and yet we’re both this close to orgasm. It’s a little scary. “The oceans that used to fill it, Hannah.”",46,"The passage seems to be from a science fiction or thriller novel.
