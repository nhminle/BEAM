I [29m] have been friends with Chad [32m] since we were born. Our moms are best friends and we grew,"up together and were roommates for the last 10 years, up until the incident that set our current situation into motion.",41,"up together, sharing countless memories and creating a bond that has only grown stronger with each passing year. We've been inseparable since childhood, exploring our neighborhood, playing in the park, and getting into all sorts of mischief. Chad's family would often come over to my house for dinner, and I would spend weekends at his place, playing video games and watching movies together. As we entered our teenage years, our friendship deepened, and we began to share our hopes and dreams with each other, supporting and encouraging one another through the ups and downs of adolescence. Even as we grew older and went off to college, our friendship remained a constant in our lives, a reminder of the special bond we shared from the very beginning."
"Anyway, forward to five months ago. I dated Hope [28f] for a few weeks. Not a big deal. We decided we weren’t feeling it, no chemistry, so we called it quits. And then lo and behold she hits","it off with Chad. Of course in true Good Luck Charm fashion, this means Chad is her soulmate. Chad is all googly-eyed over her, they’ve met the parents, they’re ring shopping—and they want to move in together. Immediately.",76,"up with me again on social media, sending me a message saying she had been thinking about me nonstop and wanted to grab coffee. I was taken aback, to say the least. I had moved on with my life, started seeing someone new, and was actually really happy. But there was a part of me that still had feelings for Hope, and I couldn't deny the spark that was reigniting between us. I agreed to meet her, and we ended up having a really great conversation, laughing and joking like old times. It was like no time had passed at all, and I found myself wondering if maybe we had been too quick to give up on each other. But as we parted ways that evening, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was playing with fire, and I wasn't sure if I was ready to get burned again. Little did I know, this was just the beginning of a complicated and tumultuous journey that would test my heart and my resolve in ways I never thought possible."
"The only problem is that Chad has six more months on our lease but found a perfect new house for him and Hope, and he can’t afford to pay rent on two places at the same",time. So he had to make the difficult decision to screw me over or screw her over—and he picked me. Now I have to find a way to cover his rent until the lease is up.,72,"time. He's been trying to convince me to break the lease, but I'm not sure if that's the best idea. On one hand, it would save us both a lot of money in the long run, but on the other hand, we could be stuck with a huge penalty for breaking the lease. I've been doing some research and found that the penalty for breaking a lease in our state is typically two months' worth of rent, which would be a significant financial hit. I've also been looking into the new house Chad found, and it's definitely a great opportunity for him and Hope, but I'm not sure if it's the right decision for me. I've been here for a few years now, and I've grown accustomed to the neighborhood and the convenience of our current location. I'm going to have to weigh the pros and cons carefully and make a decision that's best for both of us. I've also been thinking about talking to our landlord to see if there's any flexibility in the lease, maybe we can negotiate a buyout or something. I'm not sure what the outcome will be, but I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for everyone involved."
"I’m annoyed, but I decided to try to find a reason to spend more time outside so I don’t have to stare out my window. I’ve always wanted a dog, but Chad would never agree to it. So I went to a rescue and found the ugliest animal there. The one so hideous, nobody else wanted it. This dog’s got an underbite and mange, and he’s missing half an","ear. He’s a little Brussels Griffon, so he’s got that deep frown—he looks like a judgmental gremlin. I adopted him and named him Chad since the dog is now my new best friend. If you’re reading this, you’re dead to me, human Chad. (Not really, I still love the guy.) But I tag him in the captions of every Chad the Dog Instagram post with “Look, a loyal Chad!”",138,The completion of the passage is as follows:
I tilted my head so my braid fell to one side and held up four fingers. Maddy,"didn’t look happy, but she took the picture with my phone, then handed it back to me.",34,"smiled and nodded, then began to count out the same number of steps, her eyes fixed on the ground as she moved slowly forward, her ponytail bouncing behind her."
"“That dog trusts him,” Maddy said. “And that’s a rescue dog, so that means something. They’re usually all","skittish and freaked out.” She went quiet again looking at his wall. “Go down further,” Maddy said. “The billboard.”",37,"skittish and wary of strangers, but this one seems to have taken a liking to him. I've seen the way it wags its tail whenever he's around, and it even lets him pet it without hesitation. That's a big deal for a rescue dog, especially one that's been through as much as this one has. I've heard it was found wandering the streets for weeks before someone finally took it in, and it's been with him ever since. They make a pretty good team, if you ask me. The dog seems to sense when he's upset or stressed, and it'll curl up next to him to calm him down. It's almost like they have a sixth sense for each other's emotions. I've seen them out on walks together, and people always stop to comment on how well-behaved the dog is. They're definitely a popular pair around here, and it's easy to see why. The dog's loyalty to him is unwavering, and he's clearly taken on a caretaker role with it. It's a beautiful thing to see, really."
That night after work Maddy made dinner. Grilled portobello mushrooms and rice pilaf. I did,"the dishes and cleaned the kitchen, then took a shower and blew out my hair.",30,"not have much of an appetite, but the aroma of the sizzling mushrooms and the sound of the rice simmering on the stovetop filled the apartment with a sense of warmth and comfort, a stark contrast to the long day I had just endured at the office. As I sat down to eat, I couldn't help but think about the events that had transpired earlier that day, from the mundane meetings to the unexpected phone call from my old friend, reminding me that life is full of unexpected twists and turns, and that sometimes the best things in life are the ones we least expect. The flavors of the meal danced on my palate, a perfect balance of earthy and savory, and for a moment, all my worries seemed to melt away, leaving me feeling grateful for the simple pleasures in life, like a home-cooked meal and the company of good food."
"“Sorry, I had to give Brad his dewormer. I brought some for",you too. Faith said you’ve been dragging your ass on the carpet?”,24,"our trip to the farm, just in case we encountered any animals that might need it. The kids were fascinated by the process and asked a lot of questions about how it works and why it's necessary. I explained that deworming is an important part of animal care, especially when traveling to areas where parasites are common. We also made sure to wash our hands thoroughly after handling the medication and the animals, to prevent any potential health risks. As we continued on our journey, we noticed that the scenery around us was changing, with rolling hills and green pastures giving way to dense forests and winding streams. The kids were excited to explore this new environment and we took a break to let them stretch their legs and run around in the fresh air. It was a lovely day out and we were all enjoying each other's company, but I couldn't shake the feeling that we were being watched. I glanced around, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Still, the sensation persisted and I made a mental note to keep a closer eye on our surroundings as we continued on our way."
My best friend was in a Hawaiian shirt and pink cargo shorts. He was a general manager at Trader Joe’s. I missed not having to go to the grocery store now,"that he had moved out. Actually, I missed a lot of things now that Brad had moved out. Like having another human to talk to, even if it was this one.",62,"that I had to do before, but I was excited to start this new chapter in my life. I had just moved to a small beach town and was looking forward to exploring the local community. My friend, whose name was Alex, was a great guy and always knew how to make me laugh. We had met in college and had remained close over the years, despite living in different parts of the country. He was one of the first people I had called when I decided to make the move, and I was glad he was here to show me around. As we walked down the main street, he pointed out all the local shops and restaurants, telling me stories about the owners and their families. I was struck by the sense of community that seemed to permeate the town, and I felt a sense of belonging that I hadn't felt in a long time. We stopped at a small café for a coffee and sat outside, watching the surfers ride the waves at the beach. Alex told me about his job at Trader Joe's, and how much he loved the quirky products they sold. He showed me some of his favorite items, including a unique brand of coffee and a type of chocolate-covered potato chip that I had never seen before. As we chatted, I realized that I was going to love living in this town, and I was grateful to have Alex as a friend to show me the ropes."
"“This is true,” Brad said, looking at his phone. “We are",assholes. But only to each other. It’s the foundation of our friendship.”,23,"going to have to leave immediately, the meeting with the investors is in 30 minutes and we still need to finalize the presentation."
"Brad nodded at me. “You know, if she’s got the same thing you do,","if you guys date each other, you’ll both find your soulmates when you break up.”",29,"it could be a genetic trait, but we need to run some tests to confirm. I've been studying the phenomenon for years, and I've only seen it in a handful of people. The implications are enormous – if it's a genetic trait, it could be a game-changer for our understanding of human consciousness. But we need to be careful, too. If it's not a genetic trait, it could be something entirely different, something that we can't even begin to comprehend. I've seen some strange things in my time as a scientist, but this one has me stumped. I've been trying to get in touch with the other people who have this... condition, but it's not easy. They're scattered all over the world, and they're not always willing to cooperate. Still, I'm convinced that we're on the cusp of something big here, something that could change the course of human history."
They were starting to do the couples thing for all the trips and birthdays. They were all going up,"to Lutsen in October to go hiking. They asked me if I wanted to go, but I didn’t. Not alone.",39,"there, and it was starting to feel like a routine, but they still managed to surprise each other with small gestures and thoughtful gifts, like the time he planned a surprise weekend getaway to the beach, or the time she cooked his favorite meal for no reason at all, and it was these little moments that kept the spark alive in their relationship, even as they navigated the ups and downs of life together, and they both knew that as long as they had each other, they could face anything that came their way, and they were grateful for that, and they knew that their love was strong enough to overcome any obstacle, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were looking forward to many more adventures together, and they were happy to be on this journey with each other, and they knew that their love would only continue to grow and flourish, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were grateful for every moment they spent together, and they knew that their love was the real deal, and they were happy to be in love, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were looking forward to many more years of happiness together, and they were grateful for the love they shared, and they knew that it would last a lifetime, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were happy to be on this journey with each other, and they knew that their love would only continue to grow and flourish, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were grateful for every moment they spent together, and they knew that their love was the real deal, and they were happy to be in love, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were looking forward to many more years of happiness together, and they were grateful for the love they shared, and they knew that it would last a lifetime, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were happy to be on this journey with each other, and they knew that their love would only continue to grow and flourish, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were grateful for every moment they spent together, and they knew that their love was the real deal, and they were happy to be in love, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were looking forward to many more years of happiness together, and they were grateful for the love they shared, and they knew that it would last a lifetime, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were happy to be on this journey with each other, and they knew that their love would only continue to grow and flourish, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were grateful for every moment they spent together, and they knew that their love was the real deal, and they were happy to be in love, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were looking forward to many more years of happiness together, and they were grateful for the love they shared, and they knew that it would last a lifetime, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were happy to be on this journey with each other, and they knew that their love would only continue to grow and flourish, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were grateful for every moment they spent together, and they knew that their love was the real deal, and they were happy to be in love, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were looking forward to many more years of happiness together, and they were grateful for the love they shared, and they knew that it would last a lifetime, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were happy to be on this journey with each other, and they knew that their love would only continue to grow and flourish, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were grateful for every moment they spent together, and they knew that their love was the real deal, and they were happy to be in love, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were looking forward to many more years of happiness together, and they were grateful for the love they shared, and they knew that it would last a lifetime, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were happy to be on this journey with each other, and they knew that their love would only continue to grow and flourish, and they were excited to see what the future held for them, and they were grateful for every moment they spent together, and they knew that their love was the real deal, and they were happy to be"
Brad took a swallow of his drink. “Ask that nurse out. Go,"wherever she is. Pitch the idea to her, she might be into it.”",25,"on, I've been wanting to do that for weeks, but I'm too nervous. I don't know if she'd even be interested, but it's worth a shot, right? Maybe I'll go talk to her after my shift ends and see how it goes. I've seen her laughing with some of the other guys on the team, so maybe she's not as intimidating as I thought. I'll just have to muster up the courage to approach her and see what happens."
"“Yeah,” Brad said. “She dates you, you guys break up, and she rides happily into the sunset too. It’s a win-win. Seriously. This is your chance.",If you don’t do something you’re gonna spend the rest of your life sending women on to their forever families and never getting one for you.”,52,"But let's be real, it's not that simple. You've been pining for her for years, and now that she's finally single again, you're going to let some other guy swoop in and steal her away? I don't think so. You need to take a chance and make your move, even if it means risking getting hurt. It's better to know now than to wonder what could've been for the rest of your life. And who knows, maybe she feels the same way. Maybe she's been waiting for you to make a move all along. You'll never know unless you try. So, what do you say? Are you going to take a chance and see where things go, or are you going to let her slip away forever?"
Brad looked me in the eye. “You will never find someone as long as all the women you date aren’t actually meant for you. You’re not their,soulmate. Their soulmate is the person they meet after you. It’s decided the minute it starts. They are literally fated not to be The One. Think about it.”,55,"perfect match, and they're just trying to fill a void in their own lives. You're stuck in this cycle of settling for people who don't truly understand you, and it's only a matter of time before you realize that you're wasting your time. You need to take a step back and re-evaluate what you're looking for in a relationship. What are your non-negotiables? What are your deal-breakers? You need to be honest with yourself and figure out what you want before you can even think about finding someone who wants the same things. It's not about finding someone who checks all the boxes, it's about finding someone who checks your heart, and right now, you're not even looking in the right places. You're so focused on finding someone who fits your ideal, that you're missing out on the people who could truly make you happy. You need to open your eyes and see the people around you, the ones who may not be perfect, but who are perfect for you. It's time to stop searching for someone who doesn't exist and start looking for someone who does."
"I had actually thought about her. I’d checked once or twice to see if she’d messaged me again. She hadn’t. The last message was me telling her it was nice chatting with her, three days ago. Trying to keep talking to her was a dead end if she","lived somewhere else. But I don’t know. Maybe Brad had a point. What could it hurt to try? Worst-case scenario, I’d spend some time and money and have no connection with her. What was new? I was already doing that with every date that didn’t pan out anyway.",96,"completion> seemed uninterested. I'd tried to think of something witty to say, something that would make her respond, but my mind was a blank. I'd even considered sending her a funny meme or a joke, but I didn't want to come across as desperate. I'd been in this situation before, and it never ended well. I'd invested too much time and energy into people who didn't feel the same way, and it left me feeling empty and disappointed. I didn't want to go down that road again, but at the same time, I couldn't help but wonder what could have been. Maybe I was just being paranoid, maybe she was just busy, or maybe she genuinely wasn't interested. I didn't know, and the uncertainty was eating away at me. I decided to take a break from my phone and focus on something else, but my mind kept wandering back to her. I found myself thinking about our conversation, replaying every word, every laugh, and every moment we shared. It was like I was trying to hold onto something that was slipping away from me, and I didn't know how to let go. I tried to distract myself by watching TV, but my eyes kept drifting back to my phone, hoping against hope that she'd sent me a message. It was a futile effort, and I knew it, but I couldn't help myself. I was trapped in this cycle of hope and disappointment, and I didn't know how to escape. As the hours ticked by, I realized that I needed to move on, to focus on my own life and stop wasting my time on someone who didn't feel the same way. It was easier said than done, but I knew I had to try. I took a deep breath and made a decision: I would move on, and I would try to put her out of my mind. It wasn't going to be easy, but I was determined to move forward, to find someone who felt the same way, and to leave the uncertainty and disappointment behind. I closed my eyes, took another deep breath, and let go of the hope that had been holding me back. It was time to let go and move on. I slowly got up from the couch, turned off the TV, and walked away from the phone, determined to start a new chapter in my life. The uncertainty and disappointment were still there, but I was ready to face them head-on, to learn from my mistakes, and to find happiness on my own terms. I walked into the kitchen, poured myself a glass of water, and took a sip, feeling a sense of determination wash over me. I was ready to move on, to start anew, and to leave the past behind. The future was uncertain, but I was ready to face it head-on, one step at a time. I took another sip of my water, feeling a sense of calm wash over me, and I knew that I was ready to start my journey towards happiness. It wouldn't be easy, but I was ready to try. I was ready to take the first step, to take a chance, and to see where life would take me. I was ready to move on, and I was ready to find happiness. The thought sent a surge of excitement through me, and I felt a sense of hope that I hadn't felt in a long time. I was ready to take control of my life, to make changes, and to find the happiness I deserved. I was ready to move on, and I was ready to start anew. The future was full of possibilities, and I was ready to seize them. I took another sip of my water, feeling a sense of determination and hope, and I knew that I was ready to face whatever came next.

I already knew what he did for a living because Maddy had cyberstalked,"him. Of course I couldn’t tell him that, so I had to ask questions.",27,"him for months before we started dating, and I had to admit, it was a bit unsettling to think about how much she knew about him, but at least it explained why she was so confident in her opinions about his job as a private investigator, and how she always seemed to know exactly what to say to get him to open up about his cases, which was probably why he had fallen for her in the first place, but what really caught my attention was when she mentioned that he was working on a new case, one that involved a high-profile celebrity, and how she seemed to be hiding something from me about it, which made me wonder if she was involved in it somehow, and if so, what her role was, and whether it was something I should be worried about, or if I should just trust her and let her handle it, but as I looked at her, I could see the excitement in her eyes, and I knew that I had to ask her more questions, but I wasn't sure where to start, or what to say, so I just sat there in silence, waiting for her to break the news to me, and hoping that it wouldn't change everything between us."
Me: Not sure yet. I live with my best friend Maddy and we alternate who chooses,"where we’ll go next. She picked Hawaii, and I haven’t decided where to go after that.",32,"the movie we watch on Friday nights. Last week, Maddy chose that new Marvel movie, and I'm still trying to process the plot twist at the end. This week, it's my turn, and I'm thinking of going with a classic rom-com. Maddy is already giving me a hard time about it, but I'm determined to convince her that it's a great choice. I've been racking my brain for the perfect movie to pick, and I think I've finally narrowed it down to two options: ""When Harry Met Sally"" or ""The Proposal."" Both are timeless favorites, but in different ways. ""When Harry Met Sally"" is a sweet and sentimental film that always makes me laugh, while ""The Proposal"" has a great balance of humor and wit. I'm leaning towards ""When Harry Met Sally"" because it's just so relatable, but I also think Maddy might appreciate the chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock in ""The Proposal."" I'll have to see how she reacts when I make my final decision."
"For a moment I debated calling from a blocked number. He was nice, but I still didn’t know him. But I figured it",was just as easy to block him later if he got creepy. I dialed and he picked up on the first ring. “Emma.”,46,"figured it was worth a shot, and I dialed his number, my heart racing with anticipation as I waited for him to pick up. The line rang a few times before he answered, his deep voice sending a shiver down my spine. ""Hello?"" he said, and I hesitated for a moment before speaking, trying to sound casual despite the butterflies in my stomach. ""Hey, it's me,"" I said finally, my voice barely above a whisper. He paused for a moment before responding, and I could sense a hint of surprise in his tone. ""Oh, hi,"" he said, and I could almost hear the smile in his voice. I took a deep breath and launched into the reason for my call, trying to sound confident and nonchalant despite the nervous energy coursing through my veins. ""I was just wondering if you'd like to grab coffee with me sometime this week?"" I asked, my heart pounding in my chest as I waited for his response."

I couldn't help but wonder if there was any truth to his words, if every person I'd ever connected with was just a stepping stone to someone else.

Brad's words lingered in my mind, echoing through my thoughts like a mantra. I glanced over at him, his profile illuminated by the soft glow of the streetlights outside, and felt a flutter in my chest. Was it possible that he was right? That I was meant to be with someone else, someone who was out there waiting for me? The thought was both exhilarating and terrifying, leaving me feeling lost and uncertain about what the future held. I took a deep breath, trying to clear my head, but the questions swirled around me like a vortex, refusing to be silenced. What if Brad was right? What if I was meant to be with someone else? The not knowing was almost too much to bear."

So, what do you say? Are you in?"" He leaned forward, his eyes shining with excitement, and for a moment, she felt a spark of curiosity ignite within her. She hesitated, weighing the pros and cons, wondering if she was ready to take a chance on something that seemed so utterly impossible. But as she looked into his eyes, she saw something there that gave her pause – a glimmer of hope, a sense of possibility, and a hint of something more. And with that, she found herself nodding, a small smile spreading across her face as she said, ""Okay, I'm in."""

It,"wasn’t complicated for Maddy though, she knew exactly how she felt about it.",26,"involved a delicate balance of love, resentment, and a deep-seated need for validation, stemming from her own troubled past and the sacrifices she had made for our family, which often left me feeling guilty for not being able to reciprocate in the way she desired, and yet, I couldn't help but feel suffocated by her constant expectations and criticism, which made me wonder if our complicated dynamic was a result of her own unfulfilled dreams or my own inability to connect with her on a deeper level, and as I stood there, frozen in this moment of introspection, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was trapped in a never-ending cycle of emotional turmoil, trying to navigate the fine line between being a dutiful child and forging my own path in life."
"I’d stopped calling jails and hospitals years ago when this kind of thing happened. Filing a missing person’s report was a waste of time. Amber moved too fast, was too impulsive.

Or she’d meet a guy at a bar and get invited to live on his boat for four months in Florida.,69,"some seedy part of town, get into trouble, and then suddenly reappear with some wild story about how she'd been kidnapped or held against her will. But this time was different. This time, she'd been gone for three days, and her phone was dead. I'd tried calling her friends, but no one had seen her. I'd even tried calling her ex, but he just hung up on me. I was starting to get worried, and the not knowing was eating away at me. I'd always been a worrier, and this was the worst kind of worry - the kind that made you feel helpless and scared. I thought about driving around the city, searching for her, but something held me back. Maybe it was the memories of all the times she'd come back on her own, or maybe it was the fear of what I might find. Whatever it was, I knew I had to do something, but I didn't know what. So I sat there, staring at the wall, trying to think of a plan, trying to think of a way to find her before it was too late."
"“I don’t understand how that woman made this,” Maddy said, going on,",waving a hand over my face. “A fully functional member of society.”,24,"The intricate patterns and colors seemed to dance across the fabric, weaving a tale of skill and patience that Maddy couldn't even begin to comprehend, her eyes scanning the delicate stitches and threads as she tried to decipher the secrets behind the mysterious creation."
This is where we always landed with Mom. Maddy being furious on my,behalf and me reminding her that Mom wasn’t all bad. Sometimes she was wonderful.,27,"left, her eyes blazing with anger as she stormed out of the car, slamming the door behind her, while I sat frozen in the driver's seat, feeling a mix of guilt and frustration, wondering what I had done wrong this time, and why my little sister was so upset, as the silence between us grew thicker than the summer air, and I knew I had to make things right, but I didn't know where to start, or how to fix the hurt I had caused, and the tears that were welling up in my eyes began to fall, as I thought about all the times we had come to this same place, with Mom, and how it always seemed to end in disaster, and I wondered if we would ever be able to find our way back to the happy memories we used to share, before the arguing and the tears and the feeling of being lost and alone, and I knew I had to try, for my sister's sake, and for our family's sake, and for my own sake, to find a way to heal the wounds and move forward, but it seemed like an impossible task, and I felt like I was drowning in a sea of uncertainty, with no lifeline in sight, and I didn't know if I had the strength to keep going, or if I would be able to find a way out of this darkness, and back into the light, where we could be a family again, and be happy, and be whole."

This witty, enchanting woman who made you feel interesting and special.",37,"the presence of a warm, gentle breeze on a summer day, her kindness and love radiating from her like the soft glow of a sunset on a tranquil lake. She had a way of making everyone feel seen and heard, her listening ear and comforting words a balm to the soul. Her laughter was contagious, and her smile could light up a room, making even the darkest of days seem a little brighter. Whether she was cooking up a storm in the kitchen, tending to her garden, or simply sitting on the porch watching the world go by, my mother was a constant source of joy and inspiration, a reminder that love and kindness can conquer even the toughest of challenges."
"Maddy’s moms were my foster parents. They’d wanted to be my real parents, but it just never felt right. I had a mom. And I was fourteen when they got me. The imprinting didn’t take. That’s all I could say about it, it just didn’t take. I cared about them.",I called on their birthdays and came back with Maddy for Christmas when we could get it off. They just weren’t… mine. And Maddy knew it. It bothered her. She couldn’t wrap her brain around it and I couldn’t explain it to her in any way that she found acceptable.,100,"They were kind and loving, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I didn't quite belong. I'd look at pictures of my biological mom, and a pang of sadness would hit me. I'd try to push it away, but it lingered. Maddy's moms, as I called them, would notice the distant look in my eyes and try to talk to me about it, but I didn't know how to explain. I'd grown up in the system, moving from one foster home to another, never quite finding a place to call my own. When Maddy's moms took me in, I thought maybe I'd finally found a sense of belonging, but the imprinting process, which was supposed to help me bond with them, just didn't work. It was like my heart was stuck on my biological mom, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't move on. I cared about Maddy's moms, but it was different. It was a love I'd learned to accept, but it wasn't the same as the love I felt for my biological mom. I knew I was lucky to have them, but sometimes, in the quiet moments, I'd wonder what it would be like to have a mom who was biologically mine."
"Maddy hadn’t come back last night, as promised, and I guess the date went well because he was taking her to breakfast",and then some art exhibit. She wouldn’t be home until dinner. I was off and had nothing to do and nowhere to be.,45,"at the quaint little café on the corner, where they sat outside under the warm sunlight, laughing and chatting like they were old friends, and I couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy as I watched them from afar, wondering if I'd ever find someone to share a moment like that with, and as I stood there, lost in thought, I heard my phone buzz with a text from Maddy, saying she'd be home soon, and I felt a mix of relief and disappointment, knowing that my time with her was limited, and I couldn't help but wonder what the future held for us, and for her and him, as they seemed to be getting closer with each passing day."

Maddy and I had to share a bed, but it was so cool.”",29,"in the Amazon rainforest, documenting the local wildlife and their habitats. The team consisted of a mix of experienced researchers and graduate students, all of whom were eager to contribute to the groundbreaking study. Our mission was to explore the remote regions of the forest, gathering data on the unique species that called it home. As we ventured deeper into the dense foliage, the sounds of the jungle grew louder, a cacophony of birdsong, rustling leaves, and distant howls that seemed to echo through the trees. The air was thick with humidity, and the heat was oppressive, but we pressed on, driven by our curiosity and determination to uncover the secrets of this unforgiving yet breathtaking environment."
“Not today. But when I had lunch with them yesterday we talked about the Reddit thread. I told them about,"you, obviously,” he said. “That’s when Brad gave me his prophecy about you and I being able to break the curse.”",41,"the recent controversy surrounding the social media platform's handling of misinformation, and they were both quite surprised by the extent of the backlash. They asked me to explain the situation in more detail, so I spent the next hour breaking down the key points and providing examples of how the platform's algorithms can be manipulated. They listened intently, taking notes and asking thoughtful questions, and I could tell they were genuinely interested in understanding the issue. As we finished up and said our goodbyes, they mentioned that they had been thinking about starting a project to develop a more transparent and accountable approach to online discourse, and they asked if I would be interested in collaborating with them on it. I was intrigued by the idea and agreed to meet up with them again soon to discuss further."

Again.",27,"in park and waited patiently for my daughter to emerge from the crowded hallway, her friends laughing and chatting as they made their way to the cars, the sound of the school bell still echoing through the air as the students began to disperse, the warm sunlight casting long shadows across the asphalt parking lot, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me as I watched her smile and wave at me from across the way, her bright blue eyes sparkling with excitement as she made her way towards me, the sound of the engine purring softly as I waited for her to climb into the passenger seat, the smell of fresh-cut grass and blooming flowers wafting through the air, a sense of routine and familiarity that I had grown accustomed to over the years, but still found myself cherishing every time I picked her up from school, a moment of peace and quiet before the chaos of the evening rush hour, a brief respite from the hustle and bustle of daily life, a chance to reconnect with my daughter and hear about her day, to ask her about her friends and her classes, and to offer words of encouragement and support as she navigated the ups and downs of adolescence, a time of growth and change, of self-discovery and exploration, a time that was both exhilarating and terrifying, and as I waited for her to get in, I couldn't help but think about the memories we had made together, the laughter and the tears, the triumphs and the setbacks, the late-night conversations and the quiet moments of connection, the moments that had shaped us into the people we were today, and as I looked over at her, I knew that this was just the beginning of another chapter in our journey together, a chapter filled with promise and possibility, a chapter that I was eager to explore with her by my side."
"A bell rang and kids started pouring out. The last day of summer school. When I saw my brother, Alex, walking with a","group of his friends toward the buses, I rolled down the passenger side window and leaned across the seat. “Hey! Need a ride?”",46,"big smile on his face, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions. We had been apart for the entire summer, and I was excited to spend the next few weeks with him, but I was also a bit nervous about returning to school. As we walked towards each other, I noticed that he was holding a small gift box in his hand, and I wondered what it could be. ""Hey, sis!"" he exclaimed, as we hugged each other tightly. ""I got you something,"" he said, holding out the box. I took it from him, feeling a surge of curiosity and anticipation. ""What is it?"" I asked, trying to contain my excitement. Alex just grinned mischievously and said, ""You'll see."" I carefully opened the box, and inside, I found a beautiful silver necklace with a small charm in the shape of a cat. I gasped in surprise, ""Wow, Alex, it's beautiful!"" He smiled proudly, ""I saw it in a store and thought of you. I knew you'd love it."" I hugged him again, feeling grateful for my thoughtful brother and the start of a wonderful new school year."
"I got up. “I gotta get going,” I said flatly. “Want me to run",this up to Sarah?” I nodded at the bag of food for my sister.,28,"along with you? I asked, already knowing the answer, but hoping she'd say yes. The sun was just starting to rise over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the small town. We had been friends since childhood, and I had always felt a special connection with her. As I waited for her response, I couldn't help but think about the countless memories we had shared, from exploring the woods behind our houses to staying up late at night talking about our dreams. I had always thought of her as more than just a friend, but I had never mustered the courage to tell her how I truly felt. Now, as we stood there, the silence between us felt almost palpable, and I wondered if this was my chance to finally confess my feelings."

It was sort of depressing. “I got you McDonald’s.”,36,"the walls, a small wooden table in the center of the room, and a single, plush armchair in the corner. The air was thick with the scent of fresh paint and something sweet, like vanilla. I walked over to the table and ran my hand over the smooth surface, feeling a sense of unease as I realized that everything in this room was new, including the furniture, the decorations, and even the paint on the walls. It was as if she had somehow managed to erase the past and start over, leaving me feeling lost and disconnected from the memories we had made together. I looked around the room again, searching for any sign of what had happened, but everything seemed perfectly normal, almost too perfect. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I wondered what she was hiding, and what secrets lay behind the façade of this new, sterile environment."
Maddy looked up. Then her eyes dropped to the laptop I was holding and she somehow immediately,"knew what was about to happen. “No.” She shook her head. “No. No, no, no, no, no. NO.”",35,"realized that I had been working on her old project from college, the one she had abandoned years ago, and a mix of emotions flooded her face as she saw the familiar code and notes that she had written long before."

We lugged our bags up the stairs and were sweating by the time we made it to the door. We came in through a screened-in porch that overlooked the lake. Maddy and,I shared a glance. It was adorable. White wicker rocking chairs and a small matching loveseat with thick floral cushions. A cute coffee table and plastic ferns in wrought-iron planters and hanging baskets.,65,"the warm sunlight danced across the water, creating a mesmerizing display of ripples and shadows. As we stepped inside, the cool air enveloped us, a welcome respite from the sweltering heat outside. The interior of the cabin was cozy and inviting, with plush couches and a large stone fireplace that seemed to be the focal point of the room. Maddy and I exchanged a look, both of us eager to drop our bags and explore our new surroundings. We had been looking forward to this trip for weeks, and it was finally here. The cabin was nestled among the trees, surrounded by the soothing sounds of nature, and the scent of pine wafted through the air, transporting us to a world far removed from the hustle and bustle of city life. As we made our way to the kitchen, the creaky wooden floorboards beneath our feet seemed to groan in protest, but we didn't mind, knowing that we were exactly where we were meant to be."
"The bedrooms were off the living room on either side of a short hallway with a single bathroom shared in the middle. The bathroom had a white claw-foot tub, pale blue","tile, and an old pedestal sink. I took the room with the cushioned reading nook in the window and Maddy picked the one with the hanging swing chair in the corner.",62,"The bedrooms were off the living room on either side of a short hallway with a single bathroom shared in the middle. The bathroom had a white claw-foot tub, pale blue walls, and a small window above the sink that let in a sliver of natural light. The floors were made of dark hardwood, creaking softly underfoot as you walked. The hallway itself was lined with a faded floral wallpaper, its patterns barely visible in the dim light. The air was thick with the scent of old books and dust, a smell that seemed to cling to every surface. In one of the bedrooms, a large four-poster bed dominated the space, its posts adorned with intricate carvings of leaves and vines. The other bedroom was smaller, with a single window seat and a view of the garden outside. The garden was overgrown and wild, with tall weeds pushing up through the cracked pavement and a few stubborn flowers blooming in the cracks."
"Four hours later, Maddy and I were back at the cottage sitting in the screened-in porch.",We’d had dinner in town and then boated back. The fridge was stocked up and we’d unpacked.,33,"The warm sunlight filtered through the mesh, casting a gentle pattern on the wooden floor as we sipped our cold lemonade and watched the fireflies begin to dance in the fading light of day, their soft glow illuminating the lush greenery surrounding the cottage, a serene and peaceful atmosphere that seemed to wash away the remnants of our earlier adventure."
She looked away from me. “Emma…” Her eyes came back to mine. “Please. Please do it.,Do it now before you lose the chance to meet them altogether. People don’t live forever.”,32,"She looked away from me. “Emma…” Her eyes came back to mine. “Please. Please do it.

The snail’s-pace speed the pontoon put out somehow seemed faster with the beach approaching. Maddy threw it in reverse. The engine,"downshifted miserably, but we started to slow. Then to my horror we began to move backward, motor first, right into the dock.",43,"The engine sputtered and coughed, spewing forth a cloud of noxious fumes as Maddy struggled to regain control of the vessel. The beach was getting closer, its sandy shoreline and palm trees looming larger with each passing moment. The sound of seagulls filled the air, their raucous cries echoing off the water as Maddy expertly maneuvered the pontoon to avoid a group of swimmers, their brightly colored towels and beach umbrellas a stark contrast to the dull, grey metal of the boat. The sun beat down relentlessly, its intense heat radiating off the water and making the air feel thick and heavy, as Maddy finally managed to bring the pontoon to a stop just offshore, the engine dying with a final sputter."

The darkness outside seemed to press in around us, a heavy blanket that threatened to suffocate us at any moment. I glanced over at Maddy, her eyes fixed on the navigation screen, her face a mask of exhaustion and worry. The instruments were quiet, the only sound the soft hum of the ship's life support systems. We'd been running for hours, ever since the storm had forced us off course, and I could feel the fatigue creeping in, my eyelids growing heavy as I struggled to stay alert. Maddy's voice broke the silence, her words barely above a whisper as she spoke into the comms system, her voice crackling with static. ""Mayday, Mayday, this is vessel Delta-7. We're experiencing severe turbulence and are off course. Requesting assistance."" The response was immediate, a voice crackling back through the speakers, its tone detached and clinical. ""Delta-7, this is Rescue Control. We're reading your distress signal. Hold steady, help is on the way."" Maddy's eyes flicked to mine, a glimmer of hope in their depths, but I knew it was a long shot. We were a long way from anywhere, and the storm was getting worse by the minute. The ship shuddered and lurched, throwing us both off balance, and I grabbed for the armrest to steady myself. Maddy's hand closed around mine, her grip tight as she pulled me back into the chair beside her. We sat there, waiting, our hearts pounding in unison as the storm raged on outside, its fury unrelenting."
"I lined the nose of the boat up with the side of the dock and started for it again, only this time I killed the thrust earlier. We",coasted along the side and I put us into reverse to slow us down while Maddy grabbed one of the dock poles and we came to a stop.,56,"glided smoothly towards the dock, the propeller barely making a sound as we drifted closer and closer, the wooden planks creaking softly beneath the hull as we came to a stop, the engines sputtering to a halt, and I let out a sigh of relief as I killed the ignition, the silence that followed was almost deafening, broken only by the sound of seagulls crying overhead, and the gentle lapping of the water against the sides of the boat, as I stood up to tie off at the dock, my eyes scanning the surrounding area for any signs of activity, but the only movement was the gentle sway of the dock itself, and the occasional ripple in the water, as a fish broke the surface, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease, as I stepped off the boat and onto the dock, my eyes scanning the horizon for any signs of danger, but the sea was calm and peaceful, the sun shining down on us, casting a warm glow over everything, and I felt a sense of tranquility wash over me, as I stood there, taking in the sights and sounds of the dock, and the surrounding water, feeling grateful for this moment of peace, and the opportunity to clear my head, and gather my thoughts, before heading back out onto the water, whenever I was ready."
"Her phone rang. “Oh, hold on. I have to leave my ringer on in case Maddy gets in trouble trying to get back.” She looked at it. “It’s her.” She swiped and put the",phone to her ear. “Maddy?

Sarah's grip on the phone tightened as she glanced at the clock on her wall, her mind racing with worst-case scenarios. She tried to push the thoughts aside and focus on the conversation, asking Maddy about her day and what she had studied in class. Maddy chatted on, oblivious to Sarah's growing anxiety, and Sarah found herself smiling at her sister's silly jokes and stories. But as the minutes ticked by, Sarah's unease only grew, and she found herself glancing out the window, half-expecting to see Maddy's car pulling into the driveway at any moment."

""Ah, you've found the music box,"" he said, his eyes clouding over with a mix of nostalgia and sadness. ""That was my brother's, Benjamin. He was a talented musician, and that music box was one of his prized possessions. He used to play it for me when I was a child, and it always brought me peace."" I turned the music box over in my hands, feeling a sense of wonder and curiosity. ""What happened to your brother?"" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. The old man's expression turned somber, and he looked away, as if lost in thought. ""He left many years ago, never to be seen or heard from again,"" he said, his voice cracking with emotion.

I miss the sound of the city, the hum of the traffic, the chatter of people. I even miss the smell of the street food vendors. Here, all I can smell is saltwater and seaweed. I'm starting to wonder if I made a huge mistake by leaving everything behind. I glance over at Murder Mittens, who's sitting quietly by my side, and I wonder if she's feeling the same way. She seems content enough, but I'm not so sure. I take a deep breath and try to shake off the feeling of unease that's been building up inside me. I need to focus on the present moment and enjoy the beauty of this island, even if it's not what I expected. But it's hard to do when all I can think about is going back home."
The woman’s eyes moved back and forth over the mouth of her open,Coach bag. Emma took her gently by the elbow. “I’m Emma. What’s your name?”,27,"book, the pages fluttering softly in the gentle breeze that rustled through the trees outside her small, cozy study, as she searched for the perfect phrase to express the emotions that had been swirling inside her for what felt like an eternity, her mind racing with thoughts of love, loss, and longing, the words dancing on the tip of her tongue, waiting to be set free, as the sun began to set outside, casting a warm orange glow over the room, illuminating the faint scent of old books and the soft hum of the clock ticking away on the mantle, a reminder that time was running out, and she needed to find the right words before it was too late."
Maddy was already off the pontoon and running toward me across the beach. She skidded to,"a halt in front of me, still catching her breath from the sprint. “This bitch,” she managed.",33,"stop just a few feet away, her eyes wide with excitement and a huge grin spreading across her face as she flung her arms around me in a tight hug, nearly knocking me off balance with her enthusiasm, and I couldn't help but laugh at the infectious energy she radiated, feeling a warmth in my chest that I hadn't felt in a long time, and for a moment, everything else faded away, leaving only the two of us, suspended in this perfect, sun-kissed moment, the sound of the waves gently lapping at the shore and the cries of seagulls overhead the only other sounds that broke the silence."
"Amber was in a flowing white-and-peach chiffon summer dress with a slit up the thigh. Her long brown hair was down, she had on a floppy wide-brimmed hat and huge sunglasses. She was carrying","a bottle of champagne in one hand and her sandals in the other, dangling off the tips of her fingers. She was beaming, running toward us across the beach, kicking up sand. “Emma!” She laughed.",69,"carrying a large straw tote bag slung over her shoulder, its woven handles worn and frayed from countless beach trips and summer vacations. The warm sunlight danced across her skin, accentuating the golden undertones of her tan as she walked along the sun-kissed sand, her feet sinking into the soft grains with each step. The sound of the waves gently lapping at the shore created a soothing melody that seemed to match the rhythm of her heartbeat, and she felt carefree and alive, her spirit as light as the sea breeze that rustled her hair. As she walked, the salty scent of the ocean filled her lungs, invigorating her senses and washing away any lingering worries or concerns, leaving her feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, ready to take on the day with a sense of adventure and possibility."
"“Emma, you won’t believe my day,” she said, looking back at me. “So I wanted to surprise you. I flew all the way over here on","a red-eye, got an Uber, and came out to the address you gave me, but when I knocked on the door this handsome man answered instead.”",52,"my own, and I brought you a little something from the market in Paris. I know how much you love their macarons, so I picked up a few boxes of your favorite flavors. I also got you a beautiful scarf from a local designer, and I think it would look lovely with your new dress. But the best part of my day was seeing the Eiffel Tower up close – it's even more breathtaking than I imagined. I wish you were there with me to share the experience. I've been thinking about our next adventure together, and I was wondering if you'd like to join me on a trip to Italy next month? I've heard the food and wine are incredible, and I know we'd have a blast exploring the countryside together. What do you say, are you in?"
“Are you kidding me with this?” Maddy hissed as soon as they were out,of earshot. “She’s here for what? Six hours? And she’s already hypnotized our landlord?”,28,"The ridiculous excuse for a plan that her brother, Alex, had just presented to her in the dimly lit alleyway behind the old movie theater. They had been arguing about it for what felt like hours, but Maddy was still trying to wrap her head around the sheer audacity of it all. Alex had always been a bit of a wild card, but this was taking it to a whole new level. He was proposing that they sneak into the abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town, supposedly to look for a rare vinyl record that he had heard was hidden somewhere inside. Maddy was skeptical, to say the least, and she wasn't sure if she was more annoyed or concerned for her brother's sanity. As she glared at him, trying to will him into sense, Alex just shrugged and grinned, his eyes sparkling with a mischievous glint that made Maddy's heart sink."
Maddy crossed her arms. “What she always does? Show up and leave a path of,"destruction in her wake? She’s not staying with us,” she said in her end-of-discussion voice.",30,"destruction in her wake, leaving everyone to pick up the pieces and wonder what just hit them. She was a force of nature, a whirlwind that swept through the lives of those around her, leaving a trail of chaos and confusion in her path. Her latest arrival had been no exception, and as she stood there, her arms crossed and a look of defiance on her face, it was clear that she was ready to take on whatever challenges lay ahead, no matter the cost."
Maddy rolled her eyes in the way that I knew meant she was aware. “Please tell me I don’t have to stay and watch,you eat crustaceans with that woman. Let’s just go back to the island and you see her tomorrow or something when she’s done with what’s-his-face.”,49,"the awkward family dinner that my aunt insisted on hosting every year, no matter how many times I'd begged to be excused. I could already imagine the forced laughter, the inane small talk, and the inevitable argument between my parents that would leave me feeling like I was stuck in some kind of never-ending nightmare. But as I glanced over at Maddy, I could see the hint of a smile playing on her lips, and I knew she was secretly enjoying the prospect of watching me squirm. She leaned in closer, her voice barely above a whisper, and said, ""Come on, it'll be fun, I promise."" I raised an eyebrow, skeptical, but she just winked at me and continued, ""Besides, we can make it a game – see how long we can last without getting roped into the conversation about politics or my aunt's latest diet fad."" I couldn't help but chuckle at the thought, and before I knew it, I was agreeing to stay and suffer through the evening with her by my side."
I watched him walk to the beach and I let out a long breath. Maddy was right.,"This was bad. Mom never left anywhere on good terms. Not jobs, or apartments, or relationships. Especially relationships.",35,"As I stood there, the warm sun on my skin and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore, I couldn't help but think about the conversation we had earlier that day. Maddy had been trying to convince me to take a break from the city and come with her to the beach, and at first, I was hesitant, but now I was glad I had agreed. The salty air and the smell of the ocean were just what I needed to clear my head and forget about the stress of the past few weeks. I took a deep breath, feeling the tension in my body start to ease, and began to walk towards the water's edge, the cool sand squishing between my toes as I went."
I felt relieved the instant he said he would stay with me because it let Maddy off the hook. She would walk through hell for,me—and this cookout was her hell. I was glad she didn’t have to be here. Sometimes her reaction to Mom was more stressful than Mom herself.,51,"me, but now she could finally take a break from worrying about our safety and focus on her own well-being. The tension in the room dissipated as he agreed to stay, and I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. I couldn't help but think about how much I had been putting her through, and I made a mental note to apologize to her later. As I looked at him, I saw the determination in his eyes, and I knew that he was genuinely committed to helping us get through this difficult time. His presence was a beacon of hope, and I felt a sense of gratitude towards him for being there for us when we needed him most. Little did I know, this was only the beginning of a long and challenging journey, but with him by our side, I felt a sense of reassurance that we could face whatever came our way."
"“Thanks.” I looked back at the lake, at Maddy fading into",the distance on the pontoon. “And thanks for pushing her off.”,22,"The distance, the trees and reeds swallowing her whole as she disappeared from view, leaving me standing alone on the weathered dock."
"Maddy had been right about his height. He was probably about six-one. He was on the leaner side, but",toned. I’d had to put sunblock on him and there was not a single part of that that I disliked.,39,"his broad shoulders and athletic build made him appear even taller, and his dark hair was perfectly messy, as if he had just rolled out of bed and thrown it back into place, which only added to his effortless charm. His bright blue eyes sparkled with a hint of mischief, and a small, enigmatic smile played on his lips, making Maddy's heart skip a beat as he watched him laugh with the group of friends gathered around him, his deep, rich voice carrying across the room, drawing everyone in with its warmth and sincerity."
"“He’ll probably completely forget we even exist,” she mumbled, resting her head on","the cushion. “Amber has a way of making people do that,” she said tiredly.",27,"her elbow, staring blankly at the old, worn-out couch in their small, cluttered apartment, the dim light from the window casting an eerie glow on the dusty furniture."
"Now I blew out a long breath. “Well, she’s funny. Hardworking. She reads any book she can get her hands on and she remembers everything she reads, even years later. She had me really","young. Same age Amber had you, actually. She’s a good mom, always shows up for us—school stuff, birthdays. She makes these Italian cookies every Christmas and Easter that make me think of my childhood.”",68,"impressed with her knowledge of history, and her ability to recall obscure facts and figures with ease. She's also fiercely loyal to her friends and family, and will go to great lengths to support and protect them. I've seen her stand up to people twice her size when they're being bullied or taken advantage of, and it's truly inspiring to witness. Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for stray animals and children, and is always willing to lend a helping hand. She's a true gem, and I feel lucky to know her."
"When I got back to the cottage an hour later, Maddy was in the screened-in porch, reading. She","wore shorts and flip-flops, and she was drinking a beer. She set down her book when I came in.",37,"was sitting in a wicker rocking chair, her eyes fixed on the pages of a worn leather-bound book, the warm sunlight casting a golden glow on her face as she turned the pages with a look of deep concentration, the sound of the crickets and the rustling of leaves in the nearby trees creating a soothing background melody."
"“Yup. The things you cared about. The stuff you’d take in a fire,",or if Amber showed up to get you. You never once unpacked. Not really.”,27,"The family photos, the heirlooms, the memories that made your life worth living, the things that reminded you of loved ones who had passed on, the sentimental value that could never be replaced, the irreplaceable keepsakes that held a piece of your heart, the mementos that brought a smile to your face, the treasures that made you who you are today, the things that defined your identity, the memories that shaped your past, the experiences that made you grow, the lessons that taught you to cherish every moment, the love that made life worth fighting for, the things that made you feel alive, the things that made you human, the things that made you, you."
"I swear to God, I smell like rust,” Maddy whispered, sniffing her arm.",“Do I smell like rust? That water at the cottage is so gross.”,26,"The metallic scent was overpowering, and she couldn't shake the feeling that it was more than just a lingering smell from the old factory where she worked, but something deeper, a residue of the city itself, a reminder of the decay that lurked beneath its gleaming surface."
He grinned back and forth between us. “Maybe we can get together for dinner later this,"week, once you’ve gotten settled in,” he said. “Amber and I would love to have you.”",32,"evening and catch up on old times, it's been too long since we've seen each other and I've heard so much about your new project, I'm really curious to learn more about it and share some stories of my own, maybe we can even grab a drink after dinner and continue the conversation, I've been meaning to try out that new restaurant downtown that just opened up, have you heard anything about it?"
It was never going to happen. I knew this. But Maddy wouldn’t let it go unless,"I tried—and really, I should try. Maddy was right, this whole situation was a ticking time bomb.",33,"she had exhausted every possible avenue, every shred of hope, every last ounce of determination, and even then, she might not give up, for Maddy was a force to be reckoned with, a whirlwind of unrelenting passion and unwavering conviction that could leave even the most skeptical of souls questioning their own resolve, and so I stood there, frozen in anticipation, as she poured over the stack of documents, her eyes scanning the fine print with an intensity that bordered on obsession, her brow furrowed in concentration, her jaw set in a determined line, her very presence radiating an aura of unyielding resolve that seemed to say, ""I will not be defeated, I will not be deterred, I will not be silenced."""
"I paused, not sure how much I wanted to share. I decided on all of it. Emma was going to","be here when it all hit the fan anyway, so there was no point in keeping her in the dark.",40,"listen intently as I recounted the events of that fateful night, the memories still vivid in my mind like it was yesterday. I took a deep breath, steeling myself for the emotional rollercoaster that was about to unfold. Emma's eyes locked onto mine, filled with a mix of concern and curiosity, as I began to speak in a voice barely above a whisper. ""It started with a phone call from an unknown number,"" I started, my words spilling out like a confession. ""At first, I thought it was just a wrong number, but the voice on the other end sent chills down my spine. It was a low, raspy voice, and it spoke only two words: 'They're watching you.'"" I paused, letting the weight of those words sink in before continuing. ""I tried to brush it off as a prank, but the voice was too convincing, too menacing. And then, I started noticing strange things happening around me. Doors would slam shut on their own, and I'd catch glimpses of someone lurking in the shadows. I knew I had to tell someone, but who could I trust?"" Emma's eyes never left mine, her expression a mask of concentration as she listened to my tale of paranoia and fear. I could see the wheels turning in her head, trying to piece together the puzzle that was my life. And then, just as I was about to reveal the most shocking part of the story, a loud creak echoed through the hallway, making us both jump. It was then that I realized, I wasn't alone in the house."
"I studied the woman sitting next to me. Imagine someone who went through what she did, turning out the way she had. Able to give",grace to someone who’d let her down so badly. Emma was a better person than I was. And my life had been gentler than hers too.,51,"to speak with such conviction, to hold her head high, and to wear a smile that seemed to say, ""I've seen the worst, but I've also seen the best."" Her eyes, a deep shade of brown, sparkled with a hint of warmth, and her voice, though soft, carried a strength that was hard to ignore. As I continued to observe her, I found myself wondering about her past, about the trials she must have faced, and about the choices she had made to arrive at this moment. What had driven her to become the person she was today? Was it resilience, determination, or something more? I couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for her, for the way she had taken the fragments of her life and woven them into a tapestry of hope and courage."
I might kiss her tonight. I almost did the other night at the,"dock, but then Amber showed up. I was looking forward to the do-over.",26,"beach party, but I was too nervous and she was dancing with her friends, laughing and having the time of her life, and I didn't want to ruin the moment, so I just stood there, watching her, feeling a mix of emotions, a mix of excitement and uncertainty, wondering if I should take the chance and kiss her, or if I should just let things be, and see where they go from here, and now, as I'm standing here, looking at her, I'm not sure what to do, my heart is racing, and my mind is racing with thoughts of what could happen if I do kiss her, and what could happen if I don't, and I'm trying to make a decision, but my mind is a jumble of conflicting thoughts and emotions, and I'm not sure which way to turn, and I'm starting to feel like I'm losing my nerve, and I'm not sure if I'll ever find the courage to take the leap and kiss her, but at the same time, I feel like I have to try, I have to take a chance, I have to see if there's something real between us, and I'm hoping that tonight will be the night, the night I finally work up the courage to kiss her, and see where things go from there."
I’d tried to be softer with her the last few days. The energy shift I’d had over Mom after my talk with Emma,"was almost as bad as being mad at her. At least when I was mad, I didn’t feel the guilt I was feeling now.",47,"was still lingering, and I found myself being more patient and understanding with her, but it was clear that she was still hurting. I could see the pain in her eyes, the way she'd withdrawn into herself, and it broke my heart. I wanted to reach out and hold her, to tell her that everything was going to be okay, but I knew that wasn't the answer. She needed space, and I needed to respect that. So I sat down next to her on the couch, not touching her, but just being there, and waited for her to talk to me when she was ready. It was a small gesture, but it was all I could think of doing, and I hoped it would be enough to show her that I cared."
"This was another thing I was trying not to think about—her leaving. I should be happy that she came at all, that she wasn’t in Hawaii. We still had three more dates, maybe more if I could convince her. I’d already gotten a freebie the other night at","Mom’s. But I dreaded the clock running out. Emma was the only good thing happening to me at the moment and when she was gone, not only would I lose her, I’d be left sitting in my new reality. Dad gone, Mom in prison. Me with all the children.",97,"completion> the trendy new bar downtown, and I was determined to make the most of our time together. I thought about all the things I wanted to show her, all the places I wanted to take her – the botanical gardens, the art museum, the rooftop with a view of the city. I wanted to make her fall in love with this place, with me, and I was willing to do whatever it took. But the thought of her leaving still lingered, a constant reminder that our time together was limited. I pushed the feeling aside and focused on the present, on the way she smiled when I made her laugh, on the way her eyes sparkled when she talked about her passions. I was determined to make this work, to make her stay, but a part of me knew it was a losing battle. She had a life back home, a life that didn't include me, and I couldn't compete with that. I took a deep breath and let the uncertainty wash over me, trying to shake off the feeling of impending loss. I glanced at my watch, realizing we still had a few hours before our next date, and I was determined to make the most of it. I reached for my phone to text her, to ask her what she wanted to do next, but my fingers hovered over the screen, unsure of what to say. I took another deep breath and tried to clear my head, to focus on the present moment, on the woman sitting across from me, on the way she made me feel. I was in this, all the way, and I was going to make the most of it, no matter what the future held. But the thought of her leaving still lingered, a constant reminder that our time together was precious, and I was determined to cherish every moment of it."
"“Yeah,” I said. “Thank you. There’s actually something else you can help me with too,” I","said, looking at them. “I need help making sure I can still see Emma until she goes.”",33,"“I was wondering if you could tell me more about the history of this old mansion,” I asked, my eyes scanning the dusty room, filled with antique furniture and faded portraits that seemed to whisper secrets of the past."
Emma pulled two Ziploc bags from her purse. They had Wheat Thins and celery in them. Probably her,"work snacks. “I trust this zipper seal with my life,” she said, turning to hand them to our passengers.",37,"lunch, which she had hastily prepared that morning before rushing out the door to meet her friend at the park. As she sat down on the bench, she noticed a group of children playing tag nearby, their laughter and shouts filling the air. Emma took a bite of the crunchy Wheat Thin, the salty flavor a welcome respite from the warm summer sun beating down on her skin. She munched on the snack, her eyes scanning the surrounding area as she waited for her friend to arrive, the sound of the children's playdate a soothing background hum."
"I think I would have been embarrassed if I’d been on a date with anyone else. My mother, sobbing drunk the night before",she left for prison. But I knew Emma didn’t judge. That’s just not how she was. She judged this situation less than I did.,47,"had somehow managed to convince me to take her to the local karaoke bar, where she proceeded to sing a rendition of ""I Will Survive"" at the top of her lungs, much to the amusement of the entire crowd. The next morning, I was mortified, but my date, to my surprise, burst out laughing and said it was the most charming thing he'd ever seen. We ended up laughing about it together over brunch, and it actually ended up being a great conversation starter. I think that's when I realized that he was someone special, someone who could laugh at my crazy family and not judge me for it. We talked for hours, and before I knew it, the sun was setting over the city, casting a warm glow over everything. It was one of those magical moments that you never want to end, and I knew right then and there that I wanted to spend more time with him. Little did I know, that was just the beginning of a beautiful and unpredictable journey, one that would take us to places I never thought I'd go and introduce me to a love that I never knew I needed."
"When she finished handing out Kleenex, Emma stayed turned in her seat.","“You know,” she said, “I worked for three months in a women’s prison.”",25,"and gazed out the window, watching as the raindrops slid down the glass, creating a mesmerizing pattern that seemed to mirror the turmoil brewing inside her."
It was funny that two pivotal moments in my life were happening at the exact same time and at complete odds with each,other. I didn’t know how to balance what was going on with my family and what was going on with my feelings for Emma.,47,"with my desire for stability and security, I was graduating from college with a degree in fine arts, a field notorious for its unpredictability and lack of job security, while simultaneously, I was getting engaged to my long-term girlfriend, who was a practical and level-headed individual with a stable career in finance, and as I stood at the altar, exchanging vows with her, I couldn't help but wonder if I was making a huge mistake by choosing a life of creativity over a life of predictability, or if I was simply being true to myself and my passions, and as I looked into her eyes, I knew that I had to follow my heart, no matter the consequences, and so I took a deep breath and said yes, and as we sealed our love with a kiss, I felt a sense of excitement and trepidation, knowing that our journey together was only just beginning, and that the future held both promise and uncertainty, and I was ready to face it head-on, with her by my side."
"What did I have to offer her? I had nothing but baggage. Emotionally damaged, traumatized children that had been catapulted from one tragedy to the next, and me, barely keeping my head above water. Would I even have the time or the bandwidth to be any kind of partner while I was helping my",siblings navigate this situation? What was the point in even hoping for anything to be different between Emma and me? To what? Pull her from her glamorous jet-setting life to ground her with me in this fucking mess? I’d feel like apologizing every day. There was no way I could ever be worth it.,108,completion>
Sarah gave him a look. “Maybe for you. Hanging out with my brother,isn’t my idea of a good time. I’ll be outside. I want to go.”,27,"is not really my thing, but I'm doing it for you, so don't expect me to be all smiles and laughter all the time, okay?"" She crossed her arms, a hint of annoyance in her voice, but he just chuckled and wrapped his arm around her shoulders, pulling her close as they walked side by side towards the park where her brother was waiting for them."
"“Emma, go meet him at the door, or I will lose my shit. I didn’t push a clunky car stroller around the universe’s largest mall for five hours so you could shake hands","with this guy on the way out. As soon as he shows up, I’m going to park around the front at the lobby to give you some privacy. Go get your damn forehead kiss.”",67,"with some awkward, sweaty stranger who's probably going to be late anyway. I swear, I've been counting down the minutes until we can finally get home and put you down for a nap, and now you're going to make me miss our dinner reservations because of some pointless networking event. Just go, Emma, and try to make it quick, okay? I'll be over here, trying to keep our daughter from melting down in the middle of the food court."""
“So he would come home and see you there. Or because she was bored,"and lonely. FYI, Amber only ever calls you when it serves Amber,” she said.",28,"and would try to find ways to entertain herself, often ending up in the very same room where he would find her, sitting quietly, reading a book or staring out the window, lost in thought, her mind a million miles away from the mundane routine of their daily lives."
"I always thought it was a proximity thing. She traveled a lot, she changed jobs all the time, she was busy, she","was dealing with whatever Amber dealt with. But now I couldn’t rationalize why nothing was different, even though she was right here.",44,"had a lot on her plate, and I just assumed that's why we didn't stay in touch as much as we used to. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it wasn't just about her schedule or her location; it was about us, about how we had grown apart, about the fact that we had different interests and different priorities now. I remembered the way we used to spend hours talking on the phone, sharing our deepest secrets and dreams with each other, and I wondered if that was something that could ever be recaptured, or if it was just a relic of a bygone era. I thought about all the times we had promised to meet up, but never did, and the excuses we had made for not following through, and I felt a pang of guilt and regret. I realized that I had been so caught up in my own life that I had neglected our friendship, and now it seemed like it was slipping away from me, like sand between my fingers. I knew I had to reach out to her, to reconnect and see if there was still a spark left between us, but I was scared of rejection, scared of being hurt again, scared of losing what little we had left. But I knew I had to try, for old times' sake, for the sake of our friendship, and for the sake of my own sanity."
He nodded over his shoulder. “I should probably let you get back to work. I have to go pick,"up Alex and take him to a doctor’s appointment.” He paused. “Am I allowed to hug you goodbye, or…?”",38,"get my sister from the airport. She just got back from a trip to Europe and I promised her I'd be there to pick her up. I'll see you around, maybe at the office party tonight?"
"“The whole house has it. I probably have it,” I added. “Sarah’s having a",panic attack. I have to go help. I can’t leave them there infested with bugs.”,29,"The whole house has it. I probably have it,” I added. “Sarah’s having a really bad day, and I think it's all because of the argument we had last night. She's been pacing back and forth in the living room, muttering to herself, and I've heard her slamming doors and throwing things in her room. I'm starting to get a little worried about her, to be honest. I've tried talking to her, but she just won't listen. I'm not sure what's going on, but I have a feeling it's more than just a simple disagreement. Maybe it's something deeper, something that's been building up for a while now. I'm not sure what to do, but I know I need to try and talk to her again, to see if I can get to the bottom of things."
I took her hand and did my best to make my face straight. People were already stopping to watch. I made,"my voice low so only she could hear it. “Emma, would you do me the honor of delousing my family with me?”",43,"my best to maintain a neutral expression, but it was getting harder by the second. The crowd was growing, and I could feel their eyes on us like a physical weight. I tried to think of something to say, anything to distract from the awkwardness, but my mind was a complete blank. She squeezed my hand gently, and I glanced down at her, hoping to find some clue as to what she was thinking. Her eyes were fixed on mine, and for a moment, I felt a spark of connection, but it was quickly extinguished as she looked away, her face flushing with embarrassment. I took a deep breath and tried to speak, but the words caught in my throat. The silence between us was oppressive, and I could feel the weight of expectation from the people around us. I knew I had to say something, anything, to break the tension, but my mind was a complete blank. I looked around at the crowd, hoping to find some inspiration, but they just kept staring, their faces a blur of curiosity and amusement. I felt like I was trapped in a nightmare, unable to escape the awkwardness that was suffocating me. Just as I was about to give up, I remembered something my grandmother used to say: ""When in doubt, be honest."" I took another deep breath and turned back to her, my heart pounding in my chest. ""I'm sorry,"" I said, the words tumbling out of my mouth like a confession. She looked up at me, her eyes searching mine, and for a moment, I thought I saw a glimmer of understanding. But then her face fell, and she pulled her hand away, leaving me feeling more lost than ever."
"“She’ll be home one day, Sarah. It’ll come faster than you think. You can visit her and write to her and call her.","You can stay close to her—you just have to try. I know this is hard, but good things can still come out of it.”",47,"But for now, you have to be strong and hold on to the memories you shared with her. Remember the way she smiled when you made her laugh, the way her eyes sparkled when she talked about her dreams, and the way her voice sounded when she whispered 'I love you' in your ear. It's been months since she left, but the pain still feels like it's just beginning. You've tried to fill the void with work and distractions, but nothing seems to ease the ache in your heart. You've received countless letters from her, each one a reminder of the love and hope that still exists between you two. You've talked to her on the phone, hearing her voice and feeling a sense of comfort, but it's not the same as having her by your side. You've started to wonder if you'll ever see her again, if you'll ever be able to hold her in your arms and feel her warmth. But you refuse to give up hope, you refuse to lose faith in the promise that she'll be home one day."
Sarah was practically bouncing. “I can’t believe he said yes. Mom never,lets me do anything. She won’t even let me get my ears pierced.”,25,"thought she'd ever let me go to the concert, but Dad surprised us all by agreeing to take me and my friends to see our favorite band live. I've been waiting for months to see them perform their new album, and now it's finally happening. I'm so excited I can barely contain myself, and I keep jumping up and down in my seat, much to my mom's amusement. She's smiling and laughing along with me, and for a moment, everything feels perfect. But as we're making plans for the trip, I start to feel a twinge of guilt for being so excited, knowing that my mom had to work so hard to make this happen, and that my dad's approval wasn't as easy to come by as I thought. I try to push the thoughts aside and focus on the excitement of the upcoming concert, but they linger in the back of my mind, a reminder that not everything is as simple as it seems."
"In that moment, maybe for the first time ever for me, she looked like a little",girl. She was a little girl. I recognized the mask Sarah wore for what it was.,32,"girl, her eyes sparkling with a mix of curiosity and mischief, her small nose scrunched up in concentration as she carefully examined the intricate patterns on the old wooden puzzle box in front of her, her blonde pigtails bouncing with each gentle movement of her head, and for a fleeting instant, I felt a pang of nostalgia wash over me, reminding me of my own childhood, of lazy summer afternoons spent playing with my siblings in the sun-drenched backyard, of laughter and adventure and the simple joys of being young, and I couldn't help but wonder what it was about this moment that made her look so carefree, so full of life, and so utterly, completely, and totally innocent."
"After we finished with the lice, I set up the blanket in the backyard. With the landscaping Mom did, it was pretty nice back there with its hanging lights, citronella candles, and magnolia trees. I ordered a","pizza, connected my phone to a Bluetooth speaker, and poured the wine I brought, and Emma and I hung out and talked. Mom had a giant Jenga and we set that up and played a few rounds.",74,"The party decorations, including a large banner that read ""Happy Birthday"" in glittery letters, and a big inflatable unicorn that my sister had insisted on. As the sun began to set, the backyard started to transform into a magical atmosphere, with the soft glow of the lights and the sweet scent of the citronella candles filling the air. I took a step back to admire our handiwork, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment at how far we had come. The sound of laughter and chatter from the neighbors, who were starting to arrive, added to the excitement, and I couldn't wait to see the look on my sister's face when she saw the surprise party we had planned for her. I glanced at my watch and saw that it was almost time to bring out the cake, which was hidden in the garage, and I knew that the real fun was about to begin."
"“I’m a surgeon, Amber. I don’t have a nine-to-five, I stay until","it’s done, I can’t answer the phone in the middle of an appendectomy—”",25,"The hospital closes, and even then, I often find myself thinking about the cases I've seen, replaying them in my mind, trying to learn from my mistakes and improve my skills for the next patient, the next surgery, the next life I get to change. It's a heavy burden to carry, but it's one I'm willing to bear, because in the end, it's all worth it when I see a patient recover, when I see them smile, when I know I've made a difference in their life. And that's what keeps me going, that's what drives me to keep pushing forward, to keep striving for perfection, to keep being the best surgeon I can be, not just for myself, but for my patients, for their families, and for the people who trust me with their lives."
"Amber drew her arm back and threw the large glass thing again, only this","time it bounced off the car’s hood, hit the concrete, and broke in half.",28,"The sound of shattering glass echoed through the empty hallway as it hit the stone floor with a loud crash, sending shards of glass flying in all directions, and Amber's eyes widened in a mix of fear and regret as she watched the fragments scatter across the cold, dark floor, the dim light from the single flickering bulb above casting eerie shadows on the walls, and for a moment, time seemed to stand still as she stood frozen, her heart pounding in her chest, wondering what she had just done, and why she felt an inexplicable sense of relief wash over her, like a weight had been lifted off her shoulders, but as the reality of her actions began to sink in, a chill ran down her spine, and she knew she had to get out of there, and fast, before anyone found out what she had done, and she turned to make a hasty retreat, but her feet felt heavy, as if rooted to the spot, and she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched, that unblinking eyes were trained on her from the shadows, and she knew she had to move, but her legs wouldn't budge, and she was trapped in a living nightmare, with no escape in sight."
"“I have the van,” he said, his hands wandering. “Alex can’t drive it yet, so",it’s just sitting there. Uber the next time you come over and take my car home.”,31,"we'll have to make a few more trips to get everything loaded. I'll drive it back to the storage unit and then come back for you. We can take the smaller items in the truck, but the heavy stuff will have to stay in the van. I've already called ahead to let them know we're running a bit behind schedule, so they're expecting us. Alex is getting anxious, but I told him to take a few deep breaths and try to relax. He's never been in a situation like this before, and I can understand why he's stressed. I just hope everything goes smoothly and we can get everything sorted out without any issues."
He slipped a hand into my underwear and I sucked in a breath of air. “What time does,"Alex get up for the bus?” I whispered, tipping my head back as he nibbled on my ear.",36,"your classes start tomorrow, by the way, I almost forgot to ask you about the project we're working on for Mr. Johnson's class. I was thinking we could meet up at the library after lunch to go over the notes and make a plan, what do you think?"
"I came downstairs still in my pajamas, following the smell of bacon, glad I was actually in the right headspace to eat with everyone. When the stair creaked","as I made my way to the kitchen, Sarah poked her head out the door and saw me coming. “She’s here!” She darted back the way she came.",56,"under my foot, I heard my mom's cheerful voice calling out from the kitchen, ""Good morning, sleepyhead! I made your favorite breakfast, scrambled eggs and crispy bacon."" I smiled, feeling a bit more awake, and made my way to the kitchen, where the warm sunlight streaming through the window highlighted the fluffy pancakes on the table, and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air, making my stomach growl with anticipation. My siblings were already seated at the table, chatting and laughing, and my mom was busy flipping another pancake, her hair tied up in a ponytail and a big smile on her face. I took a seat next to my little sister, who was enthusiastically telling a story about her favorite cartoon character, and my brother was teasing her good-naturedly, making us all laugh. It was going to be a great day, I thought, as I poured myself a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and dug into the fluffy pancakes, savoring the sweet and savory flavors."
