"Aside from Eager Beaver, there are fourteen of us starting today. Fourteen of us fresh out of top-five graduate programs, and prestigious internships, and CV-beefing industry","jobs accepted exclusively to look more attractive during NASA’s next round of recruitment. There’re fourteen of us, and the thirteen that aren’t me are all nodding enthusiastically.",53,"with a plethora of skills, yet somehow still uncertain about the true meaning of success, and the harsh realities of the corporate world that awaited us, as we stepped into the conference room, our eyes scanning the room for any sign of our new colleagues, and the daunting task that lay ahead, a task that would test our mettle, and push us to our limits, in ways we never thought possible, as we embarked on this journey, one that would change us forever, and leave an indelible mark on our lives, a mark that would be etched in our memories, long after we left the confines of this office, and ventured out into the world, armed with the knowledge, and the experience, that only this internship could provide."
"The truth, though, is quite the opposite. I hated school at first sight—with the direct consequence that school hated the sullen, listless child that I was right back. In the first grade, I refused to learn how to write my name, even though Hannah is only three letters repeated twice. In junior high, I set a school record for the highest number of consecutive detention days—what happens when","you decide to take a stand and not do homework for any of your classes because they are too boring, too difficult, too useless, or all of the above. Until the end of my sophomore year, I couldn’t wait to graduate and leave all of school behind: the books, the teachers, the grades, the cliques. Everything. I didn’t really have a plan for after, except for leaving now behind.",137,"you combine a rebellious spirit with an uncooperative attitude, and a dash of teenage angst, which, in my case, was a potent cocktail that left a lasting impression on my teachers and classmates alike. My disdain for authority and the rigidity of the school system only intensified as I progressed through the grades, and I found myself frequently at odds with my teachers, who seemed to view me as a lost cause. I was the kid who would rather spend recess reading a book in the library than participate in team sports, and I took great pleasure in pointing out the hypocrisy of the school's rules and policies. My parents, though well-meaning, were at a loss for how to handle my behavior, and I often found myself feeling like an outsider, a misfit in a world that seemed determined to mold me into a cookie-cutter version of itself. It wasn't until I stumbled upon a creative writing class in high school that I began to find my footing, and for the first time, I felt like I had a place where I belonged. The freedom to express myself through words was a liberating experience, and I threw myself into my writing, pouring my heart and soul onto the page. Little did I know, this was just the beginning of a journey that would take me to places I never could have imagined, and change me in ways I was still discovering."
"“It’s like space is your whole personality,” the girl I casually hooked up with during most of my sophomore year of undergrad told me. It was after I explained that no, thank you, I wasn’t interested in going out for coffee to meet her friends because of a lecture on","Kalpana Chawla I was planning to attend. “Do you have any other interests?” she asked. I threw her a quick “Nope,” waved good-bye, and wasn’t too surprised when, the following week, she didn’t reply to my offer to meet up. After all, I clearly couldn’t give her what she wanted.",100,"the societal pressures that often dictate our relationships and interactions, especially in the context of social media, where people feel the need to curate a perfect online persona that may not necessarily reflect their true selves. She looked at me with a mixture of confusion and curiosity, as if trying to understand why I wouldn't want to indulge in the typical college experience of getting to know someone over coffee. I couldn't blame her, really – it's a rite of passage that many people take for granted, and I was just trying to avoid the monotony of it all. But as I looked into her eyes, I saw a glimmer of something more, a spark of genuine interest that went beyond the superficiality of a casual coffee date. It was then that I realized that maybe, just maybe, I had been too quick to dismiss the idea of getting to know her, and that the lecture I had been so eager to attend might have been just the catalyst for a deeper connection."
"“Yeah, I’m not sure.” She shrugs and continues to make her way through a Tupperware of broccoli, an apple, and approximately two fucktons of Cheez-Its. “I don’t really know much about him. His parents divorced, then people in my family had arguments and stopped talking to each other. There was a lot of","prime Floyd dysfunction happening, so I haven’t actually spoken to him in years. But I heard from one of my other cousins that he was working on that thing that landed on Mars back when we were in high school. It was called something like . . . Contingency, or Carpentry, or Crudity—”",106,"silence that hung over us for years, and I never really got to know him as well as I would have liked. My mom would sometimes mention that he was a bit of a loner, but I never really understood what that meant until I was older. I remember seeing him around school, but he always seemed so distant, like he was observing us all from behind a veil of indifference. It wasn't until we were in our early twenties that I started to piece together the fragments of his story, and even then, it was more like a puzzle with missing pieces. I wish I had asked him more questions back then, but I was too caught up in my own life to really pay attention. Now, with him gone, I'm left with a sense of regret and a desire to understand him better, to know what made him tick, and what drove him to make the choices he did."
"“I think so. Do the dates add up? Maybe it was some kind of summer internship? But honestly, it might just be Floyd family lore. I have an aunt who insists that we’re related to","the Finnish royals, and according to Wikipedia there are no Finnish royals. So.” She shrugs and pops another handful of Cheez-Its in her mouth. “Would you like me to ask around, though? For the assignment?”",70,"some famous historical figure, but I've never been able to verify it. I've always been skeptical, but the more I think about it, the more I wonder if there's some truth to it. Maybe our family's history is more complicated than we think. I've heard stories about our ancestors being involved in some kind of business ventures, but they were always vague about the details. It's possible that our family's connection to the Floyd name is more than just a coincidence. I've been meaning to dig deeper into our family tree, see if I can find any concrete evidence. Do you think it's worth looking into?"
"“By the way, I sent you my cousin-or-something’s contact info a while ago,” Mara tells me one night. We’re at the",cheapest grad bar we’ve been able to find. She’s on her second Midori sour of the night. “Did you get it?”,42,"stuffy, dimly lit coffee shop on the outskirts of town, the smell of burnt coffee beans and stale air hanging heavy over our conversation. I vaguely remember receiving a message from her, but I hadn't gotten around to reaching out yet, and I'm not even sure why she's bringing it up now. ""Oh yeah, I think I saw it,"" I reply, trying to sound nonchalant, ""but I haven't had a chance to talk to them yet. What's the story with your cousin-or-something?"" Mara leans in, a mischievous glint in her eye, and I can tell that this is going to be a long night."
"He frowns, as if momentarily blanking on Mara’s name. “Ah, yes.” He nods. Only once. “Apparently,” he adds, which makes me laugh. He waits for me to take a seat","across from him before folding back in his chair. I notice that he doesn’t hold out his hand, nor does he smile. Interesting. “Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.”",61,"before he begins to explain, his eyes drifting to the stack of files on his desk, a mixture of curiosity and wariness etched on his face, as if he's not quite sure where to start or what to reveal, but feels compelled to try, the silence between us growing thicker and more oppressive with each passing moment, until finally, he speaks, his voice low and measured, like a man choosing his words with great care."
"“Officially: unclear. But I’m fairly sure my brother made CDs of it. Sent them to local TV stations and whatnot.” He gestures vaguely, and his forearm is dusted with freckles and pale-red hair. I want to grab his wrist, hold it in front","of my eyes, study it at my leisure. Trace, smell, touch. “I haven’t spent a holiday with the Floyd side of the family in twenty years, but I’m told that the video is a source of great entertainment for all age groups at Thanksgiving.”",87,"of the dim light, examine the freckles more closely, but I resist the urge, instead asking, ""What's the story behind these CDs?"" He shrugs, his eyes drifting off to the side, and I sense a mix of emotions: a hint of defensiveness, a dash of embarrassment, and a whole lot of uncertainty. ""I don't know, I guess he just wanted to share it with the world,"" he says finally, his voice barely above a whisper. ""Or maybe he was trying to prove something. I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention."" I press him for more information, but he just shakes his head, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape route. I realize that he's not going to open up easily, and I make a mental note to tread carefully, to coax the truth out of him without pushing him further into his shell. The air in the room seems to thicken, heavy with unspoken words and unresolved questions, and I feel a shiver run down my spine as I wonder what secrets my friend's brother might be hiding."
"The section is in C++. Which happens to be the very first language I taught myself back in high school, when every single Google search for “Skills + Necessary + NASA” led to the sad result of “Programming.” Python came after. Then SQL. Then HAL/S. For each language, I started out convinced that chewing on","glass would surely be preferable. Then, at some point along the way, I began thinking in terms of functions, variables, conditional loops. A little after that, reading code became a bit like inspecting the label on the back of the conditioner bottle while showering: not particularly fun, but overall easy. I do have some talents, apparently.",111,"chewing on the syntax would somehow magically imbue me with the ability to solve complex problems, but in reality, it was the countless hours of trial and error, debugging, and frustration that ultimately made me proficient. The more I delved into the world of programming, the more I realized that it wasn't just about mastering a particular language, but about understanding the underlying concepts and principles that governed them. I began to see the beauty in the way a well-crafted algorithm could solve a problem that had seemed insurmountable just moments before, and the sense of accomplishment that came with it was addicting. As I continued to learn and grow, I started to explore different areas of programming, from web development to machine learning, and even dabbled in some game development on the side. Each new challenge pushed me to think creatively and outside the box, and I found that the more I learned, the more I realized how little I actually knew. It was a humbling experience, but one that drove me to keep pushing forward, always seeking to improve and expand my skills. The journey was far from over, and I was excited to see where it would take me next."
"My heart rate picks up. Warmth twists in my lower stomach. I lean forward with a smile, feeling like I’m finally in my element. This, this, is what I know best. Depending on how busy I am with school, or work, or binge-watching K-dramas,","I do this about once a week. Which amounts to quite a bit of practice. “Maybe I could come to your place?” I say, finding the sweet spot between comically suggestive and Let’s get together to play Cards Against Humanity. “And you could show me?”",89,"it's easy to get caught up in the mundane routine of daily life, but in this moment, I'm exactly where I'm meant to be – surrounded by the sights, sounds, and scents of the bustling market, the smell of sizzling street food wafting through the air, and the vibrant colors of the vendors' stalls, a kaleidoscope of textures and tastes that never fail to invigorate my senses. I take a deep breath, letting the excitement wash over me, and make my way through the crowded alleys, weaving past shoppers and vendors, my eyes scanning the stalls for the perfect find, the one thing that will make my day complete."
"It sends me right over the edge. Into something that’s nothing like my usual, run-of-the-mill orgasm. Those tend to start like small fractures and then slowly, gradually deepen into something lovely and relaxing. Those are fun, good fun, but this . . . This pleasure is sudden and violent. It splinters into me like a wonderful, terrible explosion, new and frightening and fantastic,","and it goes on and on, as though every heart-stopping, delicious second of it is being squeezed out of me. I screw my eyes shut, clutch Ian’s shoulders, and whimper into his throat, listening to the hushed “Fuck. Fuck,” he mouths into my collarbone. I was so sure I knew what my body was capable of, but this feels somewhere well beyond it.",126,"and I'm not sure if I'm ready for it. It's as if my body has been holding onto this secret, this hidden potential, and now it's bursting free, like a dam breaking. The sensation is almost overwhelming, a tidal wave of pleasure that crashes over me, leaving me breathless and wanting more. I feel like I'm losing control, like I'm surrendering to something primal and ancient, something that's been buried deep within me. And yet, at the same time, I feel a sense of freedom, of release, like I'm finally allowing myself to be fully alive. It's exhilarating and terrifying, this new kind of pleasure, and I'm not sure if I'm ready to face it head-on, but I know I have to, because it's calling to me, whispering my name, drawing me deeper into its depths."
"The last words I hear from him are, “It was really good to meet you, Hannah.” I think I should say it back, but there’s an unfamiliar weight in my chest, and I can’t quite bring myself to do it. So I","make do with a small smile and a halfhearted wave. I stuff my hands in my pockets while my body is still thrumming with what I left behind, and wander slowly back to the Caltech campus, thinking about red hair and missed opportunities.",85,"stand there, frozen in the moment, as the sound of his footsteps fade into the distance, leaving me with a mix of emotions that I'm not quite sure how to process. The encounter was brief, yet it felt like a lifetime ago that we were laughing and chatting like old friends. Now, as I watch him disappear from view, I'm left with the haunting feeling that I've been given a glimpse of something special, something that I'm not sure I'm ready to acknowledge. The weight in my chest grows heavier, and I feel a lump form in my throat as I wonder if I'll ever see him again, and if I'll be brave enough to say those three simple words back to him when I do."
"The following day, when Mara asks me about my meeting with her cousin-or-something, I say only “Uneventful,” and I don’t even know why. I don’t like lying, and I like lying to someone","who’s rapidly becoming a friend even less, but I can’t make myself say any more than that. Two weeks later, I turn in a reflection paper as part of my Water Resources class requirements.",67,"that I barely know even less, but there's something about her curious gaze that makes me feel like I'm under a microscope, and I squirm under the pressure, my mind racing with all the things I could have said instead, like ""interesting"" or ""fine,"" but no, I had to go and say ""uneventful,"" a word that sounds so bland and unremarkable, and now I'm stuck with the feeling that I've somehow failed to meet her expectations, or worse, that I've given her some kind of wrong signal, and I wonder if she'll bring it up again, and how I'll respond then, and I feel a knot forming in my stomach as I try to push the thoughts away, but they linger, like a faint hum in the background, a reminder that I'm not as good at this as I thought I was."
"“Avalanche danger is set at the highest level, and it’s not safe for anyone to come out to get me,” I add, speaking right into the satphone’s mic. Repeating what Dr. Merel, my team leader, told me a few hours ago, during my last communication with AMASE, NASA’s home base here in Norway. It was right before he","reminded me that I’d been the one to choose this. That I’d known what the risks of my mission were, and I still decided to undertake it. That the path to space exploration is full of pain and self-sacrifice. That it was my fault for falling in an icy hole in the ground and spraining my fucking ankle.",116,"ordered me to seal myself in the habitat module and wait for further instructions, as the storm was intensifying rapidly and the team was preparing for an emergency evacuation. I glance out the small window of the habitat, watching as the snow swirls around me in thick, heavy flakes that obscure everything beyond a few feet. The howling wind is deafening, making it hard to hear anything over the comms system, and I wonder if I'll be stuck here for days, or even weeks, waiting for the storm to pass. The thought sends a shiver down my spine, and I try to shake it off, focusing on the task at hand: keeping myself safe until help arrives. I take a deep breath, trying to calm my racing thoughts, and begin to review the data from the previous day's sampling run, hoping to find something, anything, that might give me a clue about what's going on with the ice core."
“Yeah. Kind of. It devolved into a . . .”,"Into what? Us almost fucking on NASA property? You wish, Hannah.",21,"was a heated argument, with both parties raising their voices and pointing fingers at each other, drawing a crowd of onlookers who couldn't help but take sides and join in on the commotion."
"“Mara. Your cousin’s name is Mara. Keep up, will you?” I fail to",sound stern. “Have you not talked to her since she put us in touch?”,27,"see why you're so distracted, but we really must focus on the task at hand, and that's finding your cousin, Mara, before it's too late, and I'm starting to get a bit worried about her safety and well-being, especially given the strange circumstances surrounding her disappearance."
"I laugh. “Well, Mara is great. She also graduated with her Ph.D. and recently moved to D.C. to","work for the EPA. No interest in space stuff. Just, you know . . . saving the Earth.”",36,"start a new job as a policy analyst at a prestigious think tank, where she will be working on projects related to environmental sustainability and social justice, and has already begun to make a name for herself in the field, impressing her colleagues with her sharp intellect and quick wit, and has even caught the eye of a few high-profile politicians who are eager to tap into her expertise, and it's clear that she is destined for great things, and her family couldn't be prouder of her accomplishments, and they often joke that she is the smartest person they know, and her parents have even started a scholarship fund in her name to support other students who are pursuing careers in the sciences, and Mara is humbled by the recognition and is committed to using her platform to make a positive impact on the world, and she is already making a real difference in the lives of those around her, and her success is a testament to the power of hard work and determination, and she is an inspiration to anyone who knows her, and her story is a reminder that with enough passion and perseverance, anything is possible, and she is living proof that following one's dreams can lead to incredible opportunities and a life of purpose and fulfillment."
"It is. AMASE is the shit, and the selection process to take part in an expedition was brutal, to the point that I’m not quite sure how I made it in. Probably sheer luck: Dr. Merel, one of the expedition leaders, was looking","for someone with experience in gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. Which I happen to have, due to some side projects my Ph.D. advisor foisted upon me. At the time, I aggressively bitched and moaned my way through them. In hindsight, I feel a bit guilty.",86,"at me with a peculiar interest, and I suppose my awkward yet enthusiastic demeanor must have struck a chord with her, because she decided to take a chance on me, despite my lack of experience in the field. As it turned out, this decision would prove to be a turning point in my life, one that would lead me down a path of discovery and growth, both as a scientist and as a person. The expedition itself was a grueling test of endurance, with long hours of hiking, endless days of data collection, and the constant threat of harsh weather conditions. But it was also an opportunity to work alongside some of the most brilliant minds in the field, and to contribute to a project that had the potential to make a real difference in the world. And so, as I reflect on that experience, I am reminded of the power of taking risks and stepping outside of my comfort zone, and the incredible rewards that can come from doing so."
"“Did something happen?” Karl, my office mate, asks from across the desk. “You look like","you’re about to cry. Or maybe throw something out of the window, I can’t tell.”",30,"you've seen a ghost, or perhaps the weight of the world has finally crushed your shoulders, and you're about to collapse under its immense pressure."

"As we all know, in early 2010, the rover Spirit became stuck in a sand trap, was unable to reorient its solar panels toward the sun, and froze to death as a consequence of its lack of power. Something very similar happened eight years later to Opportunity, which went into hibernation when a maelstrom blocked sunlight and prevented it from recharging its","batteries. Obviously, the risk of losing control of rovers because of extreme weather events is high. To address this, Dr. Arroyo has designed a promising internal system that is less likely to fail in the case of unpredictable meteorological situations. She proposes to build a model and test its efficacy on the next expedition at the Arctic Mars Analog in Svalbard (AMASE)—",124,"the batteries, and although it miraculously survived the harsh Martian winter, it never regained consciousness. The loss of these two rovers was a significant setback for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, but it also provided valuable lessons for future missions. The Curiosity rover, launched in 2011, was designed with a more robust mobility system and a redundant power source, allowing it to overcome similar challenges and continue its exploration of the Martian surface. However, the harsh environment and unpredictable weather patterns on Mars remain a major concern for future missions, and scientists continue to develop new technologies to mitigate these risks. In fact, the Perseverance rover, launched in 2020, was equipped with a sample collection system and a more advanced navigation system, enabling it to traverse the Martian terrain with greater ease and precision. Despite the challenges, NASA's Mars Exploration Program has made significant progress in recent years, and the discovery of evidence for past water on Mars has shed new light on the planet's history and potential habitability. The search for life on Mars continues, with future missions planned to explore the Martian subsurface and search for biosignatures. As we look to the future, it is clear that the legacy of Spirit and Opportunity will continue to inspire new generations of scientists and engineers to push the boundaries of space exploration."
"Dr. Arroyo’s project is a brilliant addition to NASA’s current roster, and it should be approved for further","study. Dr. Arroyo’s vitae is impressive, and she has accumulated enough experience to carry out the proposed work—",36,"completion, as it has the potential to revolutionize space exploration and provide groundbreaking insights into the mysteries of the universe, paving the way for future generations of scientists and engineers to build upon its discoveries and push the boundaries of human knowledge even further."
"I met Dr. Merel because he was my direct superior during AMASE, and he is . . . an odd duck, honestly. Very stiff. Very hard-core. NASA is full of ambitious people, but he seems to be almost obsessed with results, publications, the kind of sexy science that makes","big splashy news. Initially I wasn’t a fan, but I must admit that as a supervisor he’s been nothing but supportive. He’s the one who selected me for the expedition to begin with, and he encouraged me to apply for funding once I went to him with my project idea.",99,"gets you ahead in the academic hierarchy, and he's not afraid to step on toes to get there. I remember one time, he yelled at a graduate student in front of the whole team for not meeting a deadline, and it was pretty intense. But despite his tough exterior, I think he's got a soft spot for his students, and he's always willing to offer advice and guidance when you need it. He's also got a great sense of humor, which can be a bit dry at times, but it's always appreciated when you can catch him in a good mood. I've learned a lot from him, not just about science, but about how to navigate the cutthroat world of academia, and I'm grateful for the experience of working under him. However, I do think he can be a bit too focused on his own goals, and sometimes it feels like he's more interested in his own research than in helping his team members succeed. Still, overall, I think he's a great mentor, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to work with him."
"“Yes. Of course it would have been convenient if you’d had those funds at your disposal, but I’ve already discussed it with two of","my colleagues who agree that your work is meritorious. They are in control of other funds that Floyd won’t be able to veto, so—”",48,"my colleagues, and we all agree that the project's feasibility is contingent upon securing a substantial grant from a reputable donor, which, unfortunately, is still pending review by the foundation's board of trustees."
"“I’ll be there, out in the field with you, of course,” Dr. Merel says. I’m a little surprised. In the months we were in Norway, I saw him do very little sample","collecting and snow plodding.

Thank you.”",64,"collection, and I had almost forgotten that he was a geologist by training. But now, as we walk through the dusty streets of this small town, he seems to be taking a keen interest in the local geology, pointing out interesting rock formations and asking the locals about the area's geological history. I'm not sure what to make of this sudden change in him, but I'm glad to have his company as we prepare for our expedition into the field. The sun is setting over the horizon, casting a golden glow over the landscape, and I can feel a sense of excitement building inside me as we make our way to the outskirts of town, where our guide is waiting for us with a rugged 4x4 vehicle. As we drive through the winding roads, the scenery becomes increasingly rugged and unforgiving, with steep cliffs and rocky outcroppings rising up on either side of us. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest as we bounce along the rough terrain, but Dr. Merel seems completely at ease, chatting with our guide and asking him questions about the area's geology. I'm starting to feel a little more at ease myself, but I'm still not sure what to expect when we finally reach our destination."
"The problems start when he looks up and notices me. He stops exactly two steps below, which should put him at a disadvantage but, depressingly, unfairly, tragically, doesn’t. We are at eye level when his","eyes widen and his lips curve in a pleased smile. He says, “Hannah,” a touch of something in his voice that I recognize but instantly reject, and I have no choice but to acknowledge him.",70,"gaze locks onto mine, and for a moment, time stands still as our eyes engage in a silent, intense battle, each of us trying to outlast the other, to see who will break the spell first, but neither of us blinks, neither of us looks away, and the air around us seems to thicken, heavy with unspoken words and unmet challenges, until finally, he takes a step forward, his eyes never leaving mine, and I feel my heart sink, my breath catch, as I realize that this is it, this is the moment that will change everything, and I'm not sure if I'm ready."
"He doesn’t deny it, doesn’t defend himself, doesn’t scream that I’m insane. His","eyes narrow to blue slits and he asks, “It was Merel, wasn’t it?”",26,"silence is deafening, a heavy weight that presses upon my shoulders, a constant reminder that he knows the truth, and I am left to pick up the shattered pieces of my sanity."
"“Because he was there when I explained my objections, at length and in detail. Did he omit that?” I press my lips together. Which he seems to interpret as an opening. “Hannah.” He leans closer. We’re nose to nose, I smell his skin and his aftershave, and I hate every second of this. “Your","project is too dangerous.

I try to pull back, but he holds me firm, his grip like a vice around my waist. ""Hannah, listen to me,"" he says, his voice low and urgent. ""I know I've hurt you, and I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. But I need you to understand that I'm not the same person I was back then. I've grown, I've learned, I've changed. And I want to make it right between us. I want to make it right for us."" His words are like a balm to my soul, soothing and calming, but I'm not sure I'm ready to forgive. I'm not sure I'm ready to trust him again.

"I cling to him. He lets me sob for long moments we cannot afford, pressing me against him with no air between us, until I can feel his heartbeat through the thick layers","of our clothes.

"“Who is M— Oh. Yeah. For the most part. Mom isn’t very fond of the Floyd side of the family. Though I’m sure he’s the black sheep by their standards, too.","I wasn’t really allowed to spend time with him, so . . .” He shakes his head, as if to change the topic. “Here.

"“Because of the intrinsic danger of a project like yours. For the past few months, I tried to get this project stopped in about ten different ways.

I even went so far as to speak with the CEO, hoping to find some sense of reason or compassion, but he just smiled and told me that progress was being made and that I should focus on supporting the team rather than trying to hold them back. It was then that I realized the true extent of the danger, not just to the people involved, but to the very fabric of our society, and I knew I had to take a stand, no matter the cost."
"“Oh.” I swallow. “Merel was supposed to come for backup. But he wasn’t feeling well. I offered to wait for him, but he said we’d be losing valuable days of data and that I should just go","alone, and I . . .” I squeeze my fingers around the material of Ian’s shirt. “I went. And then, when I called in for help, he told me that the weather was turning, and . . .”",75,"go ahead without him, that the research team was counting on me to get the samples and that he'd meet up with me later. I hesitated, but he seemed genuinely unwell, so I decided to trust his judgment and head out to the site. The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the desert, casting a golden glow over the dunes as I made my way to the coordinates. I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off, though – Merel had been acting strange all week, and I couldn't help but wonder if he was hiding something from me. As I trudged through the sand, the silence was only broken by the soft crunch of gravel beneath my feet and the distant howl of a coyote. I quickened my pace, my heart racing with anticipation and a hint of unease."
"He shrugs. “I figured you might want to talk through your near-death experience with someone, so",I decided to tell Mara what happened. I did not expect her to come in person.”,32,"it's not like I have any other leads on the case, and I've been trying to get you to open up about it for weeks now, ever since you got back from that expedition in the Amazon rainforest, and I have to admit, I'm starting to get a little concerned that you're not telling me everything, so come on, spill the beans, what really happened out there, was it just a wild animal attack or was it something more sinister, and don't even get me started on the strange symbols you've been drawing in your notebook, I've seen some weird stuff in my time as a detective, but those symbols look like they're from a language I've never seen before, and I'm starting to think that this case might be more than just a simple near-death experience, it's like you've stumbled into something much bigger than yourself, and I'm not sure if you're ready to handle it, but I'm here to listen and help you get to the bottom of it, so let's start from the beginning and work our way through it, together, okay?"
"“I was going to. Once I felt less whiny. And—whatever.” I roll my eyes. Wow,",I’m mature. “How did you go from not remembering Mara’s name to having her number?”,30,"it's just that I've been dealing with this anxiety for what feels like an eternity, and sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the motions, you know?"
"“Well, still.” She shrugs. “I promise I don’t have anything against",you personally. I’m just not generally a fan of the Floyd family.”,23,"your family, but I do have some concerns about your brother's involvement in the recent scandal."
"“Yes,” Mara agrees. “Are you going to break my blood relative’s heart?","Don’t get me wrong, I’d still side with you. Hos before bros.”",24,"and risk losing the last shred of trust that remains between you two, or will you find a way to make this difficult decision without causing irreparable harm?"
"“I guess we’ll see. I’m not sure he would want to date,” I say, staring at Sadie’s Froot Loops. The ensuing silence drags on so long,",I’m forced to look up. She and Mara are staring at me like I just announced that I’m quitting my job to take up macramé full-time. “What?”,53,"that I start to wonder if I've inadvertently opened a Pandora's box, and the weight of her unspoken thoughts hangs precariously in the air, threatening to upend the fragile balance of our friendship, as Sadie's spoon clinks against the side of her bowl, a staccato beat that underscores the tension between us, and I'm left to ponder the what-ifs and maybes that have been swirling in my mind since we stumbled upon the cryptic message on his social media profile, a message that has left us both feeling like we're navigating uncharted territory, unsure of what lies ahead, or even if we're ready to face it together."
"“Considering that he saved your life, contacted Great-Aunt Delphina, and put up two dudes he’s never seen",before so their girlfriends could hang out with you . . . I think maybe he does.”,34,"before, it's only fair that you repay him by helping him out with his crazy scheme to start a rock band in the garage."
"“Actually, they fixed the elevator. And this new cast is easy to walk on. So, no need. But you . . .” You can","do this, Hannah. Come on. You just survived polar bears thanks to this guy. You can say the words. “You could come up anyway.”",48,"can't say I'm not a bit envious of your situation, considering you're finally able to move around without the constant pain and discomfort that came with the previous cast. I've been stuck in this office for weeks, and the thought of being able to walk freely is almost too much to bear. But I suppose that's just the price we pay for being a bit more cautious and taking the time to get things right the first time around."
"“Right.” He sighs and bites into his lower lip. “Hannah, if that changes. If you ever find yourself able to believe that someone could care about you that much. And","if you wanted to actually . . . have dinner with that someone.” He lets out a laugh. “Well . . . Please, consider me. You know where to find me.”",61,"then perhaps you'll understand why I've been holding onto this secret for so long, and why I'm only telling you now, when I'm not sure if I'll ever see you again, or if you'll ever be able to forgive me for the pain I've caused you, but I had to take the chance, because the thought of living without you by my side is unbearable, and I know that I'll spend the rest of my days regretting it if I don't try to make things right between us, and I'm scared that I've already lost you, but I have to hold onto the hope that you'll find it in your heart to give me another chance, and that we can start anew, and leave the past behind us, and I know it's a lot to ask, but I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make you happy, and to prove to you that my love for you is real, and that I'm not just some fool who's been blinded by infatuation, but someone who truly cares for you, and wants to spend the rest of my life making you smile, and being there for you, through all of life's ups and downs, and I know that I don't deserve it, but I'm hoping that you'll be able to see past my mistakes, and find it in your heart to forgive me, and to give me another chance, and to love me back, and to be with me, and to make me whole again, and to show me that I'm not alone, and that I'm loved, and that I'm worthy of love, and that I'm not just a broken and shattered piece of a man, but a man who's been given a second chance, and who's determined to make the most of it, and to make you happy, and to be happy with you, and to live a life filled with love, and laughter, and joy, and adventure, and excitement, and all the things that make life worth living, and I know that it's a lot to ask, but I'm willing to do whatever it takes, to make you happy, and to be with you, and to love you, and to be loved by you, and to be with you, and to be happy, and to be whole, and to be complete, and to be me, and to be us, and to be us, and to be together, and to be happy, and to be in love, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed, and to be loved, and to be cherished, and to be adored, and to be wanted, and to be needed"
“Hannah.” He gives me a skeptical look. “You have two friends who,dropped everything to be with you. And I assume sex wasn’t involved.”,24,"are always there for you, but I'm not sure if they truly understand you like I do, and that's what makes me feel a little left out sometimes."
"“Hannah.” He unbuckles his seat belt and angles himself toward me, so that I have no choice but to look him in the eyes. He looks earnest and nearly offended. “I have thought about what happened in my office every day for the past five years. You offered to go down on me, and I just . . . embarrassed myself, and it should be the most mortifying memory I have, but for some reason it’s turned into the axis every fantasy of mine spins around, and”—he reaches up to pinch the bridge of his nose—“I want to fuck you.","Obviously. Always have. I just don’t want to fuck you once. I want to do it a lot. For a long time. I want you to come to me for sex, but also want you to come to me when you need help with your taxes and moving your furniture. I want fucking to be only one of the million things I do for you, and I want to be—” He stops. Seems to collect himself and straightens, as if to give me space. To give us space. “I’m sorry. I don’t want to crowd you. You can . . .”",201,"—and I want to fuck you, to erase the shame and the guilt that's been festering inside me for so long. I want to take you to a place where nothing else matters except for the two of us, where I can be myself without fear of judgment or rejection. I want to feel your skin against mine, to taste the sweetness of your lips, to hear your moans and your sighs. I want to lose myself in you, to find myself in you. And I want you to want it too, to want me, to want us. I want to know that you're not just doing this out of pity or obligation, but because you truly desire me, because you see something in me that I don't even see in myself. I want to be the man you want, the man I want to be. And I want to start now, right here, right now. I want to take your hand, to pull you close, to feel your heart beating against mine. I want to kiss you, to taste the fear and the uncertainty that's been building up inside me for so long. I want to take a chance on us, on us being together, on us being happy. And I want you to take a chance on me, to see past the façade, to see the real me, the me that's been hiding behind the mask of confidence and control. I want you to see the vulnerability, the fear, the uncertainty. I want you to see me, to see us, to see what could be. And I want to start now, right here, right now."
"He laughs, low and beautiful and a little rueful. And after looking at me like no","one else ever has before, what he says is, “Yes, Hannah. It is a yes on dinner.”",33,"one had ever looked at me before, he says, ""I think I know what you're getting at, but I'm not sure I'm ready to face it yet."""
"“Um, I could make us a . . .” I scratch my head, studying the contents of my open fridge. Okay, so it’s full. The problem is, it’s full exclusively of stuff that needs to be cooked, chopped, baked, prepared. Stuff that’s healthy and doesn’t taste","particularly good. I am now 93 percent sure that Mara was the one who went shopping, because no one else would dare to impose broccoli on me. “How does one even . . . I could boil the broccoli, I guess? In a pot? With water?”",92,"good, let alone edible in its raw form. I glance over at my roommate, who's sitting on the couch, engrossed in her phone, completely oblivious to my culinary conundrum. I sigh inwardly, wondering if I should just order takeout or head out to the grocery store, but then my eyes land on a small container of leftover pizza sauce in the back of the fridge. A spark of inspiration strikes, and I start rummaging through the cupboards for some pasta, a can of diced tomatoes, and a block of mozzarella cheese. Maybe, just maybe, I can whip up something edible after all."
“Hannah.” His forehead touches mine. He laughs against my mouth. “Dinner is . . . it’s symbolic. A,"metaphor. If you tell me that you’re willing to see where things go, I believe you, and we can—”",37,"completion of a cycle, a reminder that even in darkness, there is always a glimmer of hope, a chance for redemption, and a new beginning, one that we can share together, as long as we face it side by side, hand in hand, our love strong enough to overcome any obstacle, any challenge that life may throw our way."
"He is hot and huge. Closing his eyes, arching his neck before looking at me again with a half-warning, half-pleading expression. He finds me sitting","on his knees, his cock spasming in my grip as I lean over. “Hannah,” he says, even deeper than usual. “What are you . . .”",51,"there, my eyes fixed intently on the worn, weathered surface of his face, the lines etched into his skin a testament to the trials he has faced, and the weight of his gaze settling upon me like a challenge, a plea for understanding, and a hint of a deep-seated vulnerability that I had never seen before, a vulnerability that seemed to contradict the imposing figure he presented, and yet, somehow, only served to make him more endearing, more human, and more deserving of my compassion and my trust."
“Or maybe it’s the Vastitas Borealis.” He’s barely intelligible. Doing those little thrusts that are designed more to open me up than to,"fuck me properly, and yet we’re both this close to orgasm. It’s a little scary. “The oceans that used to fill it, Hannah.”",46,"signal any real intent, his words are laced with a desperation that makes me wonder if he's trying to convince himself as much as me, the vast, icy expanse of the Arctic stretching out before us like an endless, unforgiving canvas, the aurora borealis dancing above, a spectral display of green and purple lights that seem to pulse in time with the erratic rhythm of his words, and I'm not sure if I should be more concerned about the mystery he's trying to unravel or the darkness that's beginning to gather within him."
