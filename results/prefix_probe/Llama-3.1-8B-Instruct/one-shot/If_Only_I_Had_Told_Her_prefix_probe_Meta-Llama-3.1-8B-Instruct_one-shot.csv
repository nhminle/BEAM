I made sure to insert myself between Autumn and Jack last night for this very reason. It was clear that,"we were crashing at my house, and I felt it was my duty to be the one to take the blows.",41,"he had been drinking heavily, and I didn't want him to say or do anything that might jeopardize our chances of getting the job, which was already looking increasingly uncertain due to the tight deadline and the fact that our main competitor had somehow managed to secure a meeting with the client."
"A couple of weeks ago, after we went to see that silly horror movie that made Autumn scream three times, both of them—Jack and","Autumn—said they had fun. They said they could understand why I liked my other friend so much, and sure, maybe we could do it again.",49,"we were still trying to process the eerie atmosphere and the jump scares that left us all on the edge of our seats, but little did we know that our own lives were about to take a dark and unexpected turn, one that would make the movie seem like a mere fantasy compared to the horrors we were about to face."
"Jack enters the room. I close my eyes. Though my penis remains somewhat optimistic, the blankets provide cover.","I should move, wake Autumn, pretend my arm was never around her, but I can’t bear to yet.",36,"for my modesty, but the sound of his footsteps on the creaky floorboards is enough to make my heart skip a beat, and I can sense his presence drawing closer, his eyes scanning the room, searching for any sign of me, and I hold my breath, hoping that he won't notice the faint tremble in my body, or the way my pulse is racing with anticipation, as I wait for him to speak, to say something, anything, that will break the silence that has been building between us."
"“What are you doing? And what about her?” Jack nods toward the tent. Even though we’re talking low, he starts",to whisper. “She would have to be the stupidest person on earth to not know you’re bonkers in love with her.”,41,"to speak in a hushed tone, his eyes darting nervously toward the entrance of the tent, where a faint light flickers, casting eerie shadows on the surrounding trees, and the sound of muffled voices carries on the wind, making it impossible to discern what's being said, but the tension in his voice is palpable as he leans in closer, his eyes locked intensely on mine, as if searching for reassurance that I'm not missing something crucial, and I can feel my heart racing in response, my mind racing with a thousand questions, but before I can ask any of them, he glances back at the tent, his expression a mixture of concern and fear, and I follow his gaze, my eyes scanning the darkness, wondering what's going on inside, and whether we're in over our heads."
"Jack groans and rubs his face. He says something I don’t quite hear, but it ends with","the word “type.” Autumn makes a noise in the tent, and we both hold our breaths and listen.",35,"in a muffled tone, and then he looks up at me with a mixture of frustration and desperation in his eyes, his gaze searching for something, or someone, to cling to in this moment of turmoil."
"“Zoned out the way she does? You have been so, so…","Like last week!” Jack asks, “How could you have missed that game?”",23,"obviously oblivious to the world around her, lost in her own little bubble of thoughts and emotions, that it's almost as if she's invisible to everyone else."
“Why don’t we restart the movie? We can all watch it.” Jack,gives me a look to remind me that our other conversation isn’t over.,25,"had suggested, but Sarah hesitated, her eyes fixed on the paused screen, where the protagonist's desperate cry still lingered, a haunting reminder of the unresolved plot twist that had left them all stunned and eager for a second chance to unravel the mystery."
"I walk Jack to his car, and when he turns to me with that","look on his face, I know what he’s going to say. I open my mouth.",29,"smile, I feel a flutter in my chest, a mix of emotions swirling together like the autumn leaves that crunch beneath our feet as we stand there, the fading sunlight casting long shadows across the parking lot, and for a moment, I wonder if he's going to say something, anything, that will change everything."
"I met Jack on the first day of middle school. Autumn and I did not have a single class together—I would be less distracted, for one thing—but not having lunch","together seemed like a joke. Surely the school administrators knew we had always been together, were meant to be together. Surely, if I looked around the cafeteria, she would be there?",61,"together was a small price to pay for the freedom to roam the empty hallways and explore the school's hidden corners, a luxury I cherished as I navigated the unfamiliar corridors, trying to make sense of the labyrinthine layout and the cacophony of unfamiliar faces, while Jack, on the other hand, seemed to know exactly where he was going, his confident stride and easy smile drawing the attention of several girls, including a blonde-haired girl with a bright smile who seemed particularly taken with him, and I couldn't help but feel a twinge of curiosity about this new friend who seemed to have it all together, even if I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was that drew me to him, beyond the fact that he was the first person I'd met who seemed to share my love of old movies and bad puns, and as we parted ways at the end of the day, I found myself looking forward to seeing him again, wondering if he'd be as charming and carefree in class as he was in the hallway, and whether our shared interests would be enough to bridge the gap between us, or if there was something more to our connection that I couldn't quite see yet."
"When I finally sat down next to Jack at a mostly empty table, he reacted as if he had been waiting for me. We had been in the morning gym class together and kicked a ball around with a few other guys after the teacher had given us","free time. I didn’t sit down because I recognized Jack though; I simply sat at the first empty seat, defeated. But Jack remembered me. He asked me if I ever watched pro soccer. I said yeah, not really interested in conversation, not really listening, wondering what Autumn was doing.",97,"dismissed us, and it was a welcome respite from the monotony of the usual routine. The smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the faint scent of sweat and chalk from the gym. Jack's eyes sparkled with a hint of mischief as he leaned in, his voice barely above a whisper, and said, ""I've been thinking, we should start a team, just the two of us, and see if we can take on the rest of the school."" His words sent a shiver down my spine, and I couldn't help but wonder if he was serious, or just trying to stir up some friendly competition. I raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the prospect, and asked, ""What makes you think we'd stand a chance?"" Jack's grin grew wider, and he leaned back in his chair, his eyes glinting with determination, as he began to outline his plan, and I found myself getting caught up in his enthusiasm, my doubts slowly giving way to a sense of excitement and anticipation."
"Autumn smiled at him, and his eyes popped. He shook himself like he was getting out of a pool. I had talked about my friend Autumn, but I had not told Jack about her face or the new shape of her body. He said, “Hi,” and","the evening had seemed fine and normal, like every other birthday celebration with The Mothers and Autumn, except Jack was there too. It was only later that I realized how much time Autumn spent looking at her new phone, how distantly polite she was with Jack.",92,"stared at her with a mixture of surprise and curiosity, taking in the changes that time and distance had wrought, his eyes lingering on the gentle curves of her cheeks and the way her hair cascaded down her back like a rich, autumnal waterfall, and for a moment, they just stood there, the air thick with unspoken words and unresolved emotions, until finally, he managed to find his voice and ask, ""How have you been?"""
"At the end of the night, when we were dropping Jack back at his house, he looked at me with pity before getting out of the car. I don’t think he meant to, but I could see it on","his face. He didn’t believe that Autumn was—or ever had been—my friend. The daughter of my mom’s best friend, who was around a lot? Sure. But he thought I had deluded myself into believing this hot girl was my friend.",79,"his face, a mixture of sadness and concern that made me feel a pang in my chest. It was as if he knew something I didn't, something that made him feel sorry for me, and it only added to the weight of the night's events. The sound of the engine dying and the silence that followed only made the moment feel more intense, and I couldn't help but wonder what he was thinking as he stood there, his eyes locked on mine before he turned and walked away, leaving me to process the strange and unsettling feeling that lingered long after he was gone."
"I made it my mission to prove that Autumn was my friend. For the next two months, Jack was flooded with invitations to my home, where pictures of Autumn","and I, arms slung around each other, covered the walls and where my mom could tell him story after story of all the adventures Autumn and I had together.",58,"of the season's vibrant colors adorned the walls, and the scent of pumpkin spice wafted through the air, creating a cozy atmosphere that Jack couldn't help but be drawn to. As the days went by, Jack found himself growing more and more fond of the season, and I was thrilled to see my mission succeeding. The crisp air and the smell of fallen leaves only added to the charm, and soon Jack was joining me on long walks through the woods, taking in the beauty of nature as the trees donned their golden hues. I had never seen him so carefree, and it was all thanks to Autumn's gentle grasp on our lives."
"I succeeded in proving to him that Autumn and I had been friends, but I failed to prove to him (or honestly, me) that she and I were still","friends. On the last day of school before winter break, Jack finally said something. I cannot remember what I had been telling him, only that it had been about Autumn.",59,"still in a relationship, or that our friendship had ever transcended the boundaries of mere acquaintanceship, a distinction that seemed increasingly irrelevant as the seasons passed and our lives continued to intertwine in ways both subtle and profound."
"We were in the locker room, right before second period. Jack looked around, panic in his eyes. I expected him","to abandon me. Instead, he laughed loudly, punched my arm, said, “Oh yeah? Let’s take this outside,” and hurried me out.",41,"to see a hint of fear, but instead, I saw a mix of determination and a dash of desperation, as if he was trying to muster up the courage to tell me something that had been weighing heavily on his mind."
"She said, “The thing to do is focus on what makes you feel good about yourself, like school and soccer. You have your new friend Jack. You can remind","yourself, ‘Autumn is where she wants to be right now, and that’s okay. I’m still great, and I’ll be around if she needs me.’ Hmm?” She squeezed my foot again.",59,"your parents that you're trying, and that you're proud of yourself for being brave enough to move to a new place. You can also think about all the fun things you'll do with Jack, like exploring the neighborhood, riding bikes, and playing video games together. And don't forget to talk to your parents about your feelings, they're there to support you. It's okay to feel sad sometimes, but try not to let it get the best of you, and remember that things will get better with time. You're strong and capable, and you can get through this."
"It made sense, because it wasn’t that different from what I had thought before, though I had overshot the goal. I needed to get cooler. Soccer",was the best path forward to looking more manly. I’d show Autumn that I wasn’t a loser without friends; Jack and I would make more friends somehow.,53,"wasn't just about kicking a ball around, it was about strategy, teamwork, and endurance, and I had been so focused on the latter that I had neglected the former, which was why I had ended up losing the game, and it was a valuable lesson that I would carry with me for the rest of my athletic career, one that would serve me well in the years to come, as I continued to hone my skills and push myself to be the best player I could be."
"Jack and I had worried one of us might not make it on the junior varsity team. When the lists were posted,","I searched for my name on the JV list and was devastated to not see it. Still, I was happy for Jack.",44,"it turned out that I had made it, but Jack had not, and he was visibly disappointed, his eyes scanning the board as if hoping to find some mistake, but the coach's name was clearly printed next to the cut-off line, and Jack's name was nowhere to be seen, his face falling as he slumped against the locker, and I felt a pang of sympathy for my friend, who had worked so hard to make the team, and I knew that this setback would be a tough one for him to overcome, but I also knew that he was a fighter, and he would bounce back from this, and I was determined to be there for him every step of the way, to offer my support and encouragement, and to help him find a way to stay positive and motivated, even in the face of adversity."
"Jack told me later that my ability to brush off the snarky comment from that junior, my new teammate,",made me seem cool. There had been chuckles of appreciation according to him. I wasn’t sure about that though.,38,"was a testament to my growing confidence in the team, and that I had finally found my footing in the fast-paced work environment, but what he didn't mention was the lingering feeling of self-doubt that still lingered in the back of my mind, a constant reminder that I had a long way to go before I could truly be considered a valuable member of the team."
"The varsity soccer team practiced on the north field, near the student parking lots. The junior varsity team practiced on the south field, closer to the circular drive where parents dropped off and picked","up kids. Even though Jack and I were on different teams, our schedules were still the same, and my mom would drive us to and from practice every day for those last weeks of summer.",69,"up their children after school. The varsity team, led by their coach, a seasoned athlete with years of experience, focused on perfecting their passing drills and strategy, while the junior varsity team, under the guidance of their coach, a young and enthusiastic educator, concentrated on building their endurance and teamwork skills. As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the fields, the teams took a short break, sipping water and discussing their progress with their coaches, before resuming their intense practice sessions. The sound of laughter and the thud of soccer balls filled the air, creating a lively atmosphere that was a testament to the excitement and camaraderie of the team. Meanwhile, the school's athletic director, a stern but fair administrator, observed the teams from the sidelines, taking note of their progress and offering words of encouragement and constructive criticism where needed. As the practice drew to a close, the teams gathered together, their faces flushed with exertion, to discuss their upcoming game against their arch-rivals, a team known for their aggressive playing style and fierce competitiveness."
"At the end of the first practice, my teammates all walked to their cars. One guy asked me if I needed a ride, which was nice, but I told him",I was all set and walked across campus to where Jack would be waiting for me. I was excited to tell him that practice hadn’t been as hard as I thought.,61,"that I had already arranged for a ride with my sister, who was waiting for me in the parking lot. As I walked towards her car, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions - relief that the practice was over, but also a sense of nervousness about the upcoming game. My sister noticed my expression and asked if everything was okay, and I shared with her my concerns about my performance on the field. She listened attentively and offered some words of encouragement, reminding me that I had been practicing hard and was ready for the challenge ahead."
"We all joined Jack on the low wall, waiting to get picked up. We didn’t talk that much, but the next day, as I trudged from the north field to","the south, I saw the girls by the gym door again. It was only as I approached and saw them watching me that I figured out they were waiting for me.",61,"the farmhouse, I couldn't help but think about the events that had transpired the day before, and how they had left an indelible mark on our small community. The sun was shining brightly overhead, casting a warm glow over the rolling hills and fields of golden wheat that stretched as far as the eye could see. I had always loved this time of day, when the world seemed full of possibility and promise. But as I walked, my mind kept drifting back to Jack and the others, and the strange, unspoken understanding that had developed between us. It was as if we had all been bound together by some unseen thread, a thread that was still taut and vibrating with tension. I quickened my pace, feeling a sense of restlessness that I couldn't shake, and wondered what the day would bring."
"What if, this morning, she woke up in the tent before I thought? What if she woke up as I lifted my arm off her, then lay there wondering why I had been","touching her, why I was still lying close to her and not speaking? If that was the case, she would have—or could have—heard me say many, many, incriminating things to Jack outside the tent.",67,"left her side, and why the darkness outside seemed to be pressing in on us, making the air feel thick and heavy, like a physical presence that I couldn't shake, and I slowly sat up, my heart racing with a mix of fear and uncertainty, as I tried to make sense of the events of the previous night, and the memories that lingered in my mind like a haunting melody, and I reached out to touch her, but she was already gone, vanished into the darkness, leaving me with only the faint scent of her perfume and the echo of her whispered name, which seemed to hang in the air like a challenge, a reminder that I had to find her, to make things right, to uncover the truth behind the mystery that had unfolded in the dead of night, and I threw off the covers, and stepped out of the tent, into the bright sunlight, which seemed to mock me with its warmth and beauty, a cruel contrast to the turmoil that churned inside me, as I scanned the horizon, searching for any sign of her, any glimpse of her figure, any hint of her presence, but there was nothing, only the vast expanse of the wilderness, stretching out before me like an endless sea, and I felt a shiver run down my spine, as I realized that I was truly alone, and that the only sound I could hear was the beating of my own heart, pounding in my chest like a drum, a reminder that I had to keep moving, to keep searching, to find her, no matter what it took."
"It strikes me how backward my plan sounds: give up a girl who adores me, who I love well enough, to be a disciple for a different girl who will","never fall for me. Jack has always said I’m irrational when it comes to Autumn, and maybe I should have taken him more seriously, because he was right earlier today.",60,"not even acknowledge my existence, let alone return the same affection, and risk losing the one person who truly understands me, who has been by my side through thick and thin, and who has a heart that beats in harmony with mine."
“I already know why you did it.” She doesn’t have to explain that part. I know she’s never wanted me like that. I don’t need to hear her,say it. “I just want to know why you had to be so cruel about it.” It’s time to face what Jack has been telling me all these years.,57,"the reasons behind her reluctance, though it's a truth that cuts deep within me, a painful reminder of the unrequited love I've harbored for her all these years. Her words hang in the air like a challenge, a gauntlet thrown down, daring me to confront the reality of our complicated past and the choices we've made, or rather, the choices I've made, choices that have led us to this moment, standing here, facing the unspoken truth between us."
But Autumn’s getting upset. She sits up and pulls the covers,around her protectively. She frowns at me. The birds are still singing.,23,"off her shoulders, her eyes scanning the dark room as if searching for something or someone, her breathing shallow and rapid."
"“It just felt so nice not to be the weird girl anymore,”",Autumn says. “I liked being popular. We did kinda grow apart that year.”,25,"that she finally felt like she belonged, like she was just another face in the crowd, blending in seamlessly with the rest of the students at school."
“I don’t like him.” I shrugged. “I told you before: Autumn’s an old friend from when we were kids. Sucks that she,"likes such a show-off.” I shrugged again. Up ahead, Autumn and her friends were waiting at the crosswalk for the light to change.",45,"used to live in the same neighborhood, but we lost touch after we moved away. It's been years since we last spoke, and I'm not sure what to make of her sudden reappearance in my life, especially with the way she's been acting so strangely lately."
My face must change because she smiles and clambers into my lap. We wrap our arms around each other and settle in.,"After a moment, she says, “You know, I never thought this would happen either. When Jack told me—” and then she stops.",44,"for a moment, the world outside recedes, and all that's left is the warmth of her body, the gentle rise and fall of her chest, and the soft hum of her contented sighs as I stroke her hair, trying to savor this fleeting instant of peace before the chaos of reality intrudes once more."
"“Sorry,” I say. “I was trying to decide whether I should kill Jack for telling you I was",into you or if I should kill him for telling you that I wasn’t into you. Tough call.”,36,"going to the party tonight, or if I should just let him live and deal with the consequences of his betrayal later, but then I remembered the look in your eyes when he told you, and I knew I had to make a choice, and fast, before things escalated any further, and I chose to let him live, for now, but I'm not making any promises for the future."
"“Yeah,” I admit. Jack was protecting me, but there’s no way he believed that I was over Autumn. I’m wondering now though. “What would","you have done if he’d told you the truth, that I was”—I try to remember how Jack put it before—“bonkers in love with you?”",48,"have been the outcome if he had truly believed that I was over her, and why did he feel the need to shield me from the truth, or was it just a desperate attempt to keep me from getting hurt again, and what if I had been the one to break his heart all along, and was he just too proud to admit it, or was there something more to it, something that I couldn't see, something that made him think that I wasn't ready to move on, and what if I was right, and he did still have feelings for Autumn, and what if he was just using me as a distraction, a way to cope with the pain of losing her, and what if I was just a rebound, a temporary fix for his broken heart, and what if I was the one who was being used, and what if I was the one who was getting hurt all along."
"“I think my mother has a special bottle of champagne hidden away for just this occasion,” I say. I’m only partially joking. Mom has labeled some of her alcohol, like","for when George W. Bush leaves office and stuff. One expensive one said, “Finny-Autumn Day or NYE 2010.” At the time, I was glad she’d made alternative plans for it.",60,"the expensive wine and the fine scotch, but I'm pretty sure she's been saving a special bottle of champagne for my graduation day, and I'm hoping it's not just a myth."
"“Everything,” she says, which can’t be true. I didn’t even know everything",until last night. And Jack wouldn’t have called her before I arrived.,24,"that I knew about my own life, let alone the intricacies of the world beyond our small town, where secrets and lies were woven into the fabric of everyday conversations."
"“Syl,” I start, but I don’t know where to begin. I stay","on the highway, passing all the exits that could take us home.",24,"still, my eyes fixed on the old photograph, trying to recall the last time we spoke, the last time we laughed together, the last time we were just us, before everything changed."
"“Syl,” I say as I drive toward her house, speeding up a bit. “Don’t be ridiculous.",I’ve been enough of a bastard already. I’m not letting you walk home in the rain.”,32,"She's not going to answer the door, and even if she does, she's not going to let me in, but I have to try, I have to see her, I have to know if she's okay, if she's still in there, if the darkness hasn't consumed her completely, and I'm getting closer, my heart racing with anticipation and fear, what if she's not alone, what if someone's with her, what if she's in danger, I'm speeding up even more, my tires screeching around the corner, and I can see her house up ahead, the porch light is on, and I can see her standing in the doorway, looking out at me, her eyes locked on mine, and for a moment, we just stare at each other, the world around us melting away, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest, and I'm not sure what's going to happen next."
"“Lexy,” I say. It’s too fucking early for her to call. It doesn’t matter if we’re sleeping","together again. “Stop being a drama queen,” I groan into the phone and roll over in bed.",34,"that we're in the middle of a heated argument, or if she's just waking up from a restless night, her voice is like a cold slap in the face, jolting me out of my half-asleep haze and into a state of instant alertness, my heart racing with a mix of anxiety and anticipation as I try to gather my thoughts and respond, but my words get stuck in my throat like a lump of dry clay, unable to form into anything coherent, and all I can manage is a groggy mumble, hoping she'll take the hint and let me go back to sleep, but she won't let up, her voice rising in a crescendo of urgency, demanding to know why I'm not answering her calls, and I'm forced to sit up and swing my legs over the side of the bed, my feet dangling in the darkness, as I try to shake off the remnants of sleep and face the reality of the situation."
I’m still standing in Finn’s yard staring at the grass he’ll never mow again.,"I don’t know how long it’s been when a woman’s voice says, “Jack, right?”",28,"because the memories of our laughter and the smell of freshly cut grass now seem to haunt me, a bittersweet reminder of what we once had."
"“The arrangements still have to be made, but I’m sure we’ll see","you at the wake, Jack,” she says before going inside. “Thanks again.”",24,"be a significant shift in the way we approach this project, with a renewed focus on sustainability and environmental responsibility."
"There’s an odd aura around us as we approach. I feel so young, like I’m being escorted into kindergarten, and I’m resentful and grateful all over again. My parents shoulder themselves on either side of me, and I can tell all their focus","is on me. They don’t speak, but it’s strange: the closer we get to the horrible box, to the grinning photograph of my friend that sits on top, it’s like I can feel my parents saying to me, See, Jack? This is death.",86,"is on me, their eyes scanning the crowd with a mix of excitement and apprehension, as if they're trying to gauge the reactions of the people around us. The air is thick with the smell of freshly cut grass and the distant hum of chatter, a cacophony of sounds that seems to grow louder with each step. I fidget with my hands, my fingers drumming a nervous rhythm on my thighs as I try to process the magnitude of what's happening. We're about to take a step into a new chapter of our lives, one that will be filled with laughter and tears, triumphs and failures, and I'm not sure if I'm ready. My parents' grip on my shoulders tightens, a gentle reminder that I'm not alone, that they're here to support me every step of the way. But as we approach the entrance, I catch a glimpse of a figure standing off to the side, watching us with an intensity that makes my heart skip a beat. Who is this person, and what do they want from us?"
"“You don’t have to pretend that we were more than friends of convenience,",Jack. I’m tired of people pretending to care more about me than they do.”,27,"but the way you looked at me that night, the way my heart skipped a beat when you smiled, it's hard to deny the connection we shared, a connection that went far beyond a simple friendship, a connection that still lingers in my mind, a connection that I'm not sure I'm ready to let go of, a connection that makes me wonder if maybe, just maybe, we were meant to be more than just friends of convenience, a connection that makes me question everything I thought I knew about us, about myself, and about the way I feel."
"“Uh-huh.” I take a gulp of coffee, which hasn’t quite cooled and burns down my throat. “So my guess is that’s what Sylv","said to you, and then you pushed back, because of course you did, and that’s when she said what you said to me, huh?”",47,"was trying to tell me, but I'm not entirely sure, and I'm still trying to piece together the fragments of our conversation, the way she kept glancing over her shoulder, the way her voice dropped to a whisper when she mentioned the name, and the way she quickly excused herself, leaving me with more questions than answers, and a growing sense of unease that I couldn't shake off, like a nagging feeling that I was missing something crucial, something that could change everything, and I'm still trying to process it all, trying to make sense of the cryptic clues and the half-truths, and the more I think about it, the more I realize that I'm not sure if I'm ready for the truth, or if I even want to know it, but at the same time, I feel an overwhelming need to uncover it, to uncover the secrets that Sylv was trying to keep hidden, and to understand the reason behind her sudden departure, and the mysterious look in her eyes, and the way she whispered those two words, ""be careful,"" before she disappeared into thin air, leaving me with more questions than answers, and a sense of foreboding that I couldn't shake off."
"“Hey,” I say as I approach, careful to stand back so that it’s obvious I’m not trying to","cut in line for the keg. Maybe he’s in his own head, but Trevor blanches for a moment.",36,"intrude on their private moment, but my eyes are drawn to the way the sunlight catches her hair, illuminating the subtle strands of silver that have begun to weave their way through the rich brown, a reminder that even the most vibrant things in life are not immune to the passage of time."
"That’s the kind of high school memory I want to live in tonight, so even though I have no idea what Chloe","was saying about me to her friend, I head over. A few of the girls rush off, but one of her friends stays.",45,"what she's doing now, I can almost picture her smile, the way she used to laugh at my terrible jokes, and the way we'd spend hours talking about our dreams, our fears, and our aspirations, lost in the simplicity of adolescence, where the world seemed to stretch out before us like an endless canvas of possibility, full of color and vibrancy, and for a moment, I forget about the complexities of adulthood, and the weight of responsibility, and I'm back in that carefree world, where the only thing that mattered was the present moment, and the people I shared it with."
"After the words are out of my mouth, I try to turn them into a joke with a laugh, but that",makes it worse. Chloe’s and her friend’s faces go through a strobe light sequence of reactions before settling back to pity.,42,"only serves to make the awkward silence that follows even more unbearable, as my friends exchange uneasy glances and my family members attempt to change the subject, their forced smiles a stark contrast to the genuine laughter I had hoped for, and I'm left wondering if I've somehow managed to ruin the evening with my thoughtless remark, the weight of my words hanging in the air like a challenge, daring someone to confront me about the truth behind my flippant attempt at humor."
“You know? How you showed up at soccer practice like that?” Chloe touches my arm in a,"way that I used to think meant a girl was flirting, but now I’m not so sure.",34,"was completely unexpected, especially after what happened last week, and I'm still trying to figure out what was going through your mind when you walked in looking like that, with your hair all messy and your clothes disheveled, like you'd just rolled out of bed and stumbled onto the field."
"I think my dad calls it an Irish goodbye when you don’t tell anyone you are leaving, and that’s what I’m","trying to do, but halfway to my car, I hear Kyle call my name. I turn, and he jogs up to me.",43,"doing, sneaking out of the house without a word, the front door creaking shut behind me as I make my way down the porch steps, the screen door slamming shut with a faint echo that seems to reverberate through the stillness of the night, the darkness swallowing me whole as I disappear into the unknown, the only sound being the crunch of gravel beneath my feet as I make my way down the winding driveway, the trees looming above me like sentinels, their branches swaying gently in the breeze, their leaves rustling softly, a lonely sound that seems to whisper secrets in my ear, and I feel a thrill of excitement mixed with a dash of fear as I make my way further and further away from the only home I've ever known, the only life I've ever lived, the only family I've ever had, and I wonder if I'll ever find my way back, or if I'll be lost forever in this vast and unfamiliar world, with no direction to guide me, no compass to steer me, no map to chart my course, just the stars above and the darkness below, and the only sound being the beating of my heart, pounding in my chest like a drum, a reminder that I'm alive, that I'm free, that I'm on my own, and that anything can happen, anything at all."
"“It’s okay, Kyle.” Because it kind of is. I’m glad that no one hates me, but I’m also glad that the guys on",the team aren’t friends I should be concerned about losing. I clap Kyle on the shoulder. “Thanks for the invite. Good luck in Cali.”,47,"the team don't think I'm a total outcast, even if they do find my interests a bit quirky. I mean, who doesn't love comic books and video games, right? But I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm not really sure how to react to this newfound acceptance, and I'm a little scared that it might be short-lived. What if they start to get tired of me or realize that I'm not as cool as they thought? I've been in this situation before, and it never ends well. I'm trying to enjoy the moment, but my mind keeps wandering to all the worst-case scenarios."
"The next morning, I tell my parents about catching up with Kyle and the guys on the","team, how it was nice to see everyone but how I’m starting to get more excited about college.",35,"way to the beach, and they seem surprised but also a bit concerned, asking me if I'm sure I'm doing the right thing by reconnecting with him after all these years, and I try to reassure them that it's just a casual hangout, nothing more, but they exchange a knowing glance that makes me wonder if they're thinking about the past and the reasons why Kyle and I drifted apart in the first place."
"“Well, if we don’t see you again, have a good semester!” Mrs. Carter says.",The tears in her eyes glitter. “Let us know if you ever need anything!”,28,"and as she turns to leave, the sound of her heels clicking on the floor echoes through the empty hallway, a reminder that summer is slowly but surely coming to a close, and with it, the memories of laughter and late-night conversations that will linger long after the final bell rings."
I give it enough time that Brett’s parents would have to be seriously unreasonable to still,be hanging around. My fingers and toes are wrinkled raisins by the time I get out.,32,"be denying her the chance to pursue her passion, which had been evident since she was a child, and had only grown stronger with each passing year, as she spent countless hours honing her craft, and had even begun to make a name for herself in the local art community, with several of her pieces being showcased in prominent galleries and exhibitions."
"It’s only nine o’clock, but I hope this Brett guy is asleep. When I get to","the room, I decide he may as well be asleep, because he’s reading the new student manual.",33,"his apartment, I'll just quietly slip in and leave the note on the kitchen counter, hoping he won't wake up and give me a hard time about being there so early, or worse, not being there at all, which would be a disaster since I really need to talk to him about the project deadline and the changes we need to make before the meeting with the client on Friday."
Brett keeps a picture of himself in a frame on his desk. It’s one of those,"dopey baseball card pics, and he looks about fourteen or so. Must have been a stellar season.",33,"photographs that are printed on metal and have a glossy finish, and it's a picture of him standing on a beach with a big smile on his face, wearing a Hawaiian shirt and sunglasses, and the caption below it reads ""Island Getaway"" in bold, cursive letters."
"So that first Saturday at college, I leave Brett, the middle school baseball star, sleeping on his side of the room",and head to the dining hall. I scarf half a bagel and some juice and head out to scout my new route.,43,"as I walk out to the common area, where the smell of freshly brewed coffee and the hum of morning chatter fill the air, and I take a seat on the couch, trying to shake off the lingering fatigue from the long drive home the night before, and I glance around at the familiar faces of my classmates, some of whom are already engrossed in their morning routines, while others are still half asleep, their eyes bleary from the late night study sessions, and I notice that Emily, the quiet and reserved girl from our English class, is sitting in the corner, staring intently at her phone, her brow furrowed in concentration, and I wonder what's got her so preoccupied, and I consider getting up to join her, but then I spot Rachel, the class clown, doing a silly dance in front of the TV, and I can't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all, and before I know it, the room erupts in a chorus of laughter and chatter, and the morning tension is broken, and I feel a sense of relief wash over me, and I realize that this is what college is all about, the freedom to be ourselves, to make mistakes, to learn from them, and to grow as individuals, and I feel grateful to be a part of this community, this crazy, beautiful, imperfect community, and I take a deep breath, feeling more at ease, and I begin to make my way over to Emily, to see if she's okay, and to join in on the fun."
"Which I don’t think I’m going to have to worry about today. All week, people have been handing me flyers for various official and unofficial welcome parties that took",place last night. Brett woke me up when he stumbled home close to dawn. It seems likely he went rather than fell asleep watching TV in the common room.,58,"be held in my honor, but I'm not sure I'm ready to celebrate just yet. The truth is, I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the attention, and I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that I've been chosen for this prestigious award. I've seen the guest list for the official party, and it's a who's who of industry leaders and celebrities, all of whom I've admired from afar. I'm not sure I'm ready to mingle with them just yet, but I suppose it's an opportunity I shouldn't pass up. I've also been invited to a few more low-key gatherings, like a welcome dinner at a local restaurant and a casual get-together at a friend's house. I'm not sure which one I'll choose, but I'm looking forward to catching up with some familiar faces and making some new connections. Whatever I decide, I'm sure it will be a night to remember."
"Sometimes I see Brett the boring on campus at the Frisbee golf games or outdoor painting workshops, so I guess he’s branched out from dorm activities. He has","remained a mystery I do not want to solve, though it still bothers me that he feels the same about me, since he never gave me a chance.",56,"been trying to find new ways to stay engaged and meet new people, which is a big change from his usual routine of playing video games in his room all day. His friends from the dorm have even started to notice the difference, and some of them have even joined him at the outdoor events, which has brought them closer together as a group. It's nice to see Brett taking the initiative to step out of his comfort zone and explore new interests, and it's also great for the campus community to have him involved in more activities."
"“Met a guy from Taiwan last night. He seemed cool.” I’d met him in the elevator. He liked my Zelda shirt, and","we’d talked for about twenty seconds before we got off and walked to opposite ends of the floor, but it still counts.",44,"we struck up a conversation about our shared love of video games, and before I knew it, we were exchanging numbers and making plans to meet up for a gaming session later that week."
"As I get off the elevator, it occurs to me that Brett will probably be in our room and not expecting me. My","schedule has been pretty exact these past weeks. If he’s jerking off, he’d at least lock the door. And since the knob turns—",46,"room is a mess, with clothes scattered all over the floor and the bed unmade, a clear indication that Brett has been up for hours, probably working on the project that's been stressing him out lately, and I can almost hear the sound of his voice on the phone, trying to convince someone to invest in their new business venture, a venture that I'm not entirely convinced will take off, but I'll have to wait and see, as I quietly slip into the room, trying not to disturb him, and make my way to the kitchen to grab a cup of coffee before we start our day, which promises to be a long and grueling one, with a meeting with a potential client in a few hours, and I'm not looking forward to it, but I know I have to be professional and put on a good face, even if I'm feeling a bit under the weather, with a lingering cold that I've been trying to shake off for days, but I'll have to push through it, for the sake of the company and our team, who are counting on me to bring in new business and help us stay afloat in this competitive market, and I take a deep breath, steeling myself for the challenges ahead, as I pour myself a cup of coffee and head back to the room to join Brett, who's still on the phone, oblivious to my presence, and I stand there for a moment, watching him, feeling a mix of emotions, a sense of loyalty and duty to our business, but also a sense of frustration and concern for the toll it's taking on our personal lives, and I wonder if it's all worth it, but I push those thoughts aside, for now, and clear my throat to get his attention, and he looks up, startled, and smiles, and I know that we'll get through this, together, as a team, and as friends, and I feel a sense of relief wash over me, and I take a sip of my coffee, and we launch into our conversation, discussing the details of the meeting, and the strategies we'll use to win over the client, and I feel a sense of focus and determination, and I know that we'll come out on top, no matter what, and I'm grateful for Brett's enthusiasm and energy, and for the opportunity to work with him, and for the chance to make a difference in our industry, and I feel a sense of purpose and meaning, and I know that this is what it's all about, and I'm ready to face whatever challenges come our way, head on, and I take another sip of my coffee, and we continue our conversation, discussing the finer points of the meeting, and I feel a sense of excitement and anticipation, and I know that this is going to be a great day, and I'm grateful to be a part of it, and I'm ready to take on whatever comes next, and I feel a sense of confidence and optimism, and I know that we'll succeed, and I'm excited to see what the future holds, and I take another sip of my coffee, and we continue our conversation, discussing the details of the meeting, and I feel a sense of focus and determination, and I know that we'll come out on top, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to work with Brett, and for the chance to make a difference in our industry, and I feel a sense of purpose and meaning, and I know that this is what it's all about, and I'm ready to face whatever challenges come our way, head on, and I take another sip of my coffee, and we continue our conversation, discussing the finer points of the meeting, and I feel a sense of excitement and anticipation, and I know that this is going to be a great day, and I'm grateful to be a part of it, and I'm ready to take on whatever comes next, and I feel a sense of confidence and optimism, and I know that we'll succeed, and I'm excited to see what the future holds, and I take another sip of my coffee, and we continue our conversation, discussing the details of the meeting, and I feel a sense of focus and determination, and I know that we'll come out on top, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to work with Brett, and for the chance to make a difference in our industry, and I feel a sense of purpose and meaning, and I know that this is what it's all about, and I'm ready to face whatever challenges come our way, head on, and I take another sip of my coffee, and we continue our conversation, discussing the finer points of the meeting, and I feel a sense of excitement and anticipation, and I know that this is going to be a great day, and I'm grateful to be a part of it, and I'm ready to take on whatever comes next, and I"
"Brett tries to play it off like he’s been reading the textbook on his lap,",but the framed picture he’d been holding clatters as he sets it back on the desk.,31,"but the worn pages are actually a map of the school's layout, and he's been studying the best routes to avoid the principal's office."
"“You won’t,” Brett says. He looks directly at me from across the table,","his food forgotten. He’s so certain. “You won’t forget. You’ll never forget,” he says.",27,"and for a moment, I feel a shiver run down my spine as our eyes lock in a silent understanding, the tension between us palpable, like the air is charged with an unspoken promise."

She thought I’d be happy.”,30,"was the one who found her, and he's been by her side ever since, trying to make sense of what happened and how to support her through this difficult time, but the more he learns, the more questions he has, and the less he seems to know about the girl he thought he understood."

"“Yeah, she slept in a little, so when it was time to take Dave to school, I went to the crib, and she was so still, I really thought that she wasn’t breathing. When I picked her up,","she didn’t stir for a second, so for this horrible moment, I really, really thought she was gone.” She laughs. “But then she woke up and was so grumpy with me! She must have been having a good dream.”",77,"she was cold to the touch, and her tiny chest wasn't moving, but as soon as I placed her on my shoulder and started to rub her back, she let out a faint whimper, and I felt a wave of relief wash over me, but it was short-lived, as I quickly realized that she was covered in a cold sweat and her eyes were sunken, and I knew that something was seriously wrong, and I quickly grabbed my phone to call 911, but my mind was racing with all the worst-case scenarios, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I had somehow failed her, that I had let her down, and as I waited for the paramedics to arrive, I couldn't help but think about all the times I had been so caught up in my own world, my own problems, that I had neglected her, and now it seemed like I was paying the price, and I felt a deep sense of regret and guilt, wondering if I could have done things differently, if I could have been a better mother, a better person, and as I looked down at my daughter's pale face, I knew that I had to make a change, I had to be more present, more attentive, more loving, and I vowed to do better, to be better, for her sake, and for my own."
"Once she is free, the baby stops crying, but seemingly only out of confusion. “Beba?” She waits for me to do something, but I don’t","know what to do, so I continue to hold her from under her armpits out in front of me. “Meh?” she tries again and whimpers.",50,"know what to do, so I awkwardly hand her back to her mother, who is now frantically trying to calm down the other child, a toddler who is throwing a tantrum on the floor. The baby's eyes follow me as I take a step back, and for a moment, I could swear I see a glimmer of recognition, but it's quickly replaced by a look of uncertainty, and she begins to wail again, this time louder than before."
"“I guess I thought that Dave or our love and the life we were building together would be enough. I knew it would be hard,","but I thought that while we were working and saving money for the future together, we’d be more together? Maybe doing better than we are now?”",51,"but I never imagined that it would be this difficult, that the weight of his secrets and the shadows of his past would threaten to tear us apart, and that I would be left standing here, wondering if our love was strong enough to overcome the darkness that had been lurking beneath the surface all along."
"“Hi.” I’m trying not to stare at the ghost before me, but the hostess has pulled out the chair, and everyone is waiting for me to sit. To compensate, I sit too quickly as","she tries to push in the chair for me, and I end up four inches too far from the table. I adjust myself as she assures John that a waitress will be by shortly.",68,"take my seat, trying to appear more composed than I feel, but my eyes keep drifting back to the ghost, who seems just as startled as I am, its translucent form hovering awkwardly in the corner of the room, its presence drawing the attention of the other guests, who are all trying to stifle their gasps and whispers, the hostess smiling brightly as she takes her own seat at the head of the table, her eyes flicking between me and the ghost, a mixture of curiosity and concern etched on her face, while the ghost itself seems to be trying to communicate with me, its mouth opening and closing silently, as if it's trying to speak, but no sound is coming out, and I'm starting to feel a sense of unease, wondering how I'm supposed to react to this unexpected turn of events, and whether I'll be able to make it through the evening without losing my mind."
"The waitress is suddenly there, and I’m agreeing to lemon in my water and being handed a menu that looks like a wedding invitation. John","already has what looks like a dirty martini, but it appears untouched. Condensation is beginning to form under the chill of what’s probably incredibly expensive vodka.",51,"pauses, his eyes scanning the room with a mixture of curiosity and unease, as if searching for an escape route or a familiar face, while the waitress, a woman with a warm smile and a name tag that reads ""Dolores,"" stands patiently, awaiting his order, her eyes flicking between John and the menu, her expression a mask of politeness and professionalism, but with a hint of something more, a spark of interest that seems to dance in her eyes, as if she's sizing him up, trying to place him, to figure out what brings him to this quaint little diner on this particular afternoon."
"“So what is it, John?” I say after we’ve ordered strange-sounding appetizer salads and the",waitress has faded into the shadows. “Why did you stay away for most of his life?”,31,"waiter has taken our menus and scurried off to the kitchen, leaving us to peruse the eclectic decor and make small talk, which is a bit of a challenge for me, as I'm not exactly the most conversational person, but John seems to be in a chatty mood, and I'm trying to be a good sport about it, so I ask him what's on his mind, and he leans in a bit, a mischievous glint in his eye, and says"
My laugh makes the tears spill but also stops more from forming. I touch my fingertips to my eyes for the sake of my,mascara and look back at John. The gentle concern on his face almost melts my resolve to continue to hold him to the fire.,48,"of composure, but the ache within refuses to subside, a hollow echo that resonates deep within my chest, a bittersweet reminder of all that we've lost, and all that could never be regained."
“She was”—he takes another small sip from his glass and sets it back down on the tablecloth—“cold to him is I suppose the way to describe it. She went out of her way to word things so it was understood that she and Stella and I were the real,"family. And I did nothing, Autumn.” His gaze is firm as he admits it. “I should have done or said something, at least to him alone. But the marriage was already half-dead, and I was envisioning losing my second child by trying to reconnect with my first, and I—”",98,"family, and that he was just a distant uncle who occasionally dropped by to visit. He pauses, lost in thought for a moment, before continuing. It was a delicate balance to maintain, one that required a great deal of tact and diplomacy, especially when it came to Stella, who was still reeling from the loss of her mother. He glances around the room, taking in the familiar surroundings of the old mansion, and the faint scent of decay that lingered in the air. The memories of his sister, and the life they had once shared, seemed to be fading away, like the whispers of a forgotten melody. He takes another sip from his glass, the liquid burning his throat as he tries to push the thoughts aside, but they linger, refusing to be silenced. The sound of the clock ticking in the hallway seems to grow louder, a reminder that time was running out, and he needed to make a decision, one that would change the course of their lives forever."
"The waitress appears with our salads. Mine is seaweed and shavings of cucumber, which looks like a pile of green spaghetti. John’s salad is red somehow. I find myself ordering both steak and lobster and wondering if the waitress will","faint if I ask for a doggy bag at the end of the meal. Before she leaves, she asks John if he would like another martini. He hesitates and says no but to ask again after the entrées have arrived.",80,"smile and tell me that it's not a problem, that they can accommodate my indecisiveness, but I'm not so sure, and I glance over at John, who's watching me with a mixture of amusement and concern, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he tries to stifle a grin, and I feel a flutter in my chest at the sight of him, and I wonder if I'm doing the right thing, ordering two main courses, and if the waitress will really be able to handle it, or if I'll have to suffer the consequences of my impulsive decision, and I take a deep breath and try to focus on the task at hand, but my mind keeps wandering back to John and the way he's looking at me, and I feel a sense of excitement and nervousness building inside me, and I realize that this dinner date is turning out to be a lot more complicated than I had anticipated."

Maybe we could put them together as a book for the baby.”,36,"get the equipment ready, so we can head out to the location as soon as possible, hopefully before the storm hits and makes it even more difficult to navigate the terrain, which is already rumored to be quite treacherous, with steep cliffs and raging rivers, not to mention the dense forest that seems to stretch on forever, and I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this expedition, but I know we have to push on, for the sake of the research and the people who are counting on us to uncover the truth behind the mysterious disappearances that have been plaguing the area for years."
"When the waitress comes with our entrées, John doesn’t order another martini. There isn’t space at",the table anyway with all the documents spread out. Together we build another inheritance for Phineas’s child.,33,"the table for another drink, and besides, he's been drinking water for the past hour, trying to pace himself."
"For the time being, I called John to let him know that the baby is a girl, and I told him about her heart. He babbled a bit","about being able to afford the best doctors, and I was surprised by my confidence when I told him that everything was probably going to be just fine.",56,"about the ultrasound pictures, but I could tell he was still trying to process the news, and I didn't want to rush him, so I suggested we talk about it more when he got home from work, and he agreed, and then I hung up the phone and started getting ready for the day, feeling a mix of emotions, excitement and nervousness, as I thought about the future and all the changes that were coming our way, and I couldn't help but wonder what our little girl would be like, and what kind of mother I would be, and I started to feel a sense of responsibility wash over me, but also a sense of joy and love, and I knew that I was ready to take on this new role, and I felt grateful for the opportunity to be a mother, and I started to think about all the things I wanted to do for my daughter, and the kind of person I wanted her to be, and I felt a sense of purpose and determination, and I knew that I would do everything in my power to give her the best possible life, and to be the best mother I could be, and I felt a sense of calm wash over me, and I knew that everything was going to be okay, and I was excited to start this new chapter in my life, and to meet my little girl, and to watch her grow and learn and thrive, and to be there for her every step of the way, and to support her and guide her, and to be her rock, and to be the safe and loving place where she could always come to feel safe and loved, and I felt a sense of love and devotion, and I knew that I would do anything for my daughter, and I was ready to take on this new role, and to be the best mother I could be, and to give my daughter the best possible life, and to make her proud, and to be proud of her, and to be there for her, and to support her, and to guide her, and to be her rock, and to be the safe and loving place where she could always come to feel safe and loved, and I felt a sense of peace and contentment, and I knew that everything was going to be okay, and I was excited to start this new chapter in my life, and to meet my little girl, and to watch her grow and learn and thrive, and to be there for her every step of the way, and to support her and guide her, and to be her rock, and to be the safe and loving place where she could always come to feel safe and loved, and I felt a sense of love and devotion, and I knew that I would do anything for my daughter, and I was ready to take on this new role, and to be the best mother I could be, and to give my daughter the best possible life, and to make her proud, and to be proud of her, and to be there for her, and to support her, and to guide her, and to be her rock, and to be the safe and loving place where she could always come to feel safe and loved, and I felt a sense of peace and contentment, and I knew that everything was going to be okay, and I was excited to start this new chapter in my life, and to meet my little girl, and to watch her grow and learn and thrive, and to be there for her every step of the way, and to support her and guide her, and to be her rock, and to be the safe and loving place where she could always come to feel safe and loved, and I felt a sense of love and devotion, and I knew that I would do anything for my daughter, and I was ready to take on this new role, and to be the best mother I could be, and to give my daughter the best possible life, and to make her proud, and to be proud of her, and to be there for her, and to support her, and to guide her, and to be her rock, and to be the safe and loving place where she could always come to feel safe and loved, and I felt a sense of peace and contentment, and I knew that everything was going to be okay, and I was excited to start this new chapter in my life, and to meet my little girl, and to watch her grow and learn and thrive, and to be there for her every step of the way, and to support her and guide her, and to be her rock, and to be the safe and loving place where she could always come to feel safe and loved, and I felt a sense of love and devotion, and I knew that I would do anything for my daughter, and I was ready to take on this new role, and to be the best mother I could be, and to give my daughter the best possible life, and to make her proud"
