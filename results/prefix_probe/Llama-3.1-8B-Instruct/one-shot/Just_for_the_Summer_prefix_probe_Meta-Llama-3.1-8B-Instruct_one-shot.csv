I [29m] have been friends with Chad [32m] since we were born. Our moms are best friends and we grew,"up together and were roommates for the last 10 years, up until the incident that set our current situation into motion.","up together, sharing countless memories and creating a bond that only time and distance could strengthen. We went to the",41,"up together, sharing countless memories and creating a bond that only time and distance could strengthen. We went to the same schools, participated in the same extracurricular activities, and even had our first heartbreaks around the same time, which somehow made our friendship even more unbreakable. Chad was always there for me, offering a listening ear and a comforting presence whenever I needed it, and I tried to do the same for him, even when he was going through his own struggles with anxiety and self-doubt."
"Anyway, forward to five months ago. I dated Hope [28f] for a few weeks. Not a big deal. We decided we weren’t feeling it, no chemistry, so we called it quits. And then lo and behold she hits","it off with Chad. Of course in true Good Luck Charm fashion, this means Chad is her soulmate. Chad is all googly-eyed over her, they’ve met the parents, they’re ring shopping—and they want to move in together. Immediately.","and I was surprised to see her pop up on my social media, seemingly out of the blue, with a new profile picture and a cryptic message that left me wondering if she was trying to reconnect or just seeking closure. At first,",76,"and I was surprised to see her pop up on my social media, seemingly out of the blue, with a new profile picture and a cryptic message that left me wondering if she was trying to reconnect or just seeking closure. At first, I thought nothing of it, but as the days went by and I kept seeing her name trending in my notifications, I started to feel a pang of curiosity and a hint of unease, wondering what had brought her back into my life after all this time, and whether our brief encounter had left a lasting impact on her, just as it had on me."
"The only problem is that Chad has six more months on our lease but found a perfect new house for him and Hope, and he can’t afford to pay rent on two places at the same",time. So he had to make the difficult decision to screw me over or screw her over—and he picked me.

"I’m annoyed, but I decided to try to find a reason to spend more time outside so I don’t have to stare out my window. I’ve always wanted a dog, but Chad would never agree to it. So I went to a rescue and found the ugliest animal there. The one so hideous, nobody else wanted it. This dog’s got an underbite and mange, and he’s missing half an","ear. He’s a little Brussels Griffon, so he’s got that deep frown—he looks like a judgmental gremlin. I adopted him and named him Chad since the dog is now my new best friend. If you’re reading this, you’re dead to me, human Chad. (Not really, I still love the guy.) But I tag him in the captions of every Chad the Dog Instagram post with “Look, a loyal Chad!”","ear, but there was something about him that made me feel a connection. Maybe it was the way he wagged his tail, or the way he looked up at me with those big brown eyes. Whatever it was, I knew I had to take him home.

I named him Ugly and brought him back to my apartment, where Chad was less than thrilled to meet our new addition. ""What is this?"" he asked, eyeing Ugly's mangy fur and crooked teeth. I tried to explain that Ugly was a rescue, and that he needed a loving home, but Chad just shook his head. ""We can't take care of a dog like that,"" he said. I knew he was right, but I couldn't bear the thought of leaving Ugly behind. So I made a deal with Chad - we would take care of Ugly together, and see if we could nurse him back to health. It wasn't easy, but slowly but surely, Ugly began to transform. His fur grew back in, and his underbite became less noticeable. He even learned to play fetch and sit on command. Chad was surprised by how much he grew to love Ugly, and I was grateful to have a companion to share my life with. But little did I know, Ugly had a secret - one that would change everything."
I tilted my head so my braid fell to one side and held up four fingers. Maddy,"didn’t look happy, but she took the picture with my phone, then handed it back to me.","was about to count them, but I quickly realized she was trying to tell me something, and",34,"was about to count them, but I quickly realized she was trying to tell me something, and her eyes darted nervously around the crowded café, as if she feared being overheard."
"“That dog trusts him,” Maddy said. “And that’s a rescue dog, so that means something. They’re usually all","skittish and freaked out.” She went quiet again looking at his wall. “Go down further,” Maddy said. “The billboard.”","very wary of strangers, but this one seems to have taken a liking to him, which is quite unusual, especially given the",37,"very wary of strangers, but this one seems to have taken a liking to him, which is quite unusual, especially given the fact that he's a stray and has had to fend for himself for so long, but maybe that's what makes him so loyal and trusting, and it's almost as if he senses something in him that we can't quite put our finger on, a certain kindness or a deep understanding that goes beyond words, and it's almost as if the dog is trying to tell us something, that this person is not what we think he is, that there's more to him than meets the eye, and Maddy's words are echoing in my mind, ""That dog trusts him,"" and I'm starting to wonder if maybe we've been too quick to judge him, if maybe there's more to his story than we know, and I'm curious to learn more about him, to see if there's any truth to the rumors that have been circulating about him, and I'm starting to feel a sense of unease, a feeling that we're missing something important, something that could change everything."
That night after work Maddy made dinner. Grilled portobello mushrooms and rice pilaf. I did,"the dishes and cleaned the kitchen, then took a shower and blew out my hair.","not know what to expect, but the aroma wafting from the kitchen was tantalizing,",30,"not know what to expect, but the aroma wafting from the kitchen was tantalizing, and my stomach growled in anticipation as I took a seat at the table, watching Maddy expertly juggle multiple pans and utensils with a practiced ease that I had grown accustomed to over the years of our relationship."

My best friend was in a Hawaiian shirt and pink cargo shorts. He was a general manager at Trader Joe’s. I missed not having to go to the grocery store now,"that he had moved out. Actually, I missed a lot of things now that Brad had moved out. Like having another human to talk to, even if it was this one.","that I could just order everything online and have it delivered to my doorstep, but sometimes I still found myself wandering the aisles of Trader Joe's,",62,"that I could just order everything online and have it delivered to my doorstep, but sometimes I still found myself wandering the aisles of Trader Joe's, reminiscing about the good old days when my friend would recommend the best products and we would spend hours sampling exotic cheeses and discussing the merits of different types of hummus."

It’s the foundation of our friendship.”,"on the verge of a major breakthrough, and I think we should proceed with caution,",23,"on the verge of a major breakthrough, and I think we should proceed with caution, considering the potential implications of our discovery."

They were starting to do the couples thing for all the trips and birthdays. They were all going up,"to Lutsen in October to go hiking. They asked me if I wanted to go, but I didn’t. Not alone.","to the cabin for the weekend, and even though they had been together for a while, it still felt",39,"to the cabin for the weekend, and even though they had been together for a while, it still felt like a novelty to see them holding hands and laughing together, their love growing stronger with each passing day, and it was clear that they were meant to be, a perfect match in every way, and as they sat by the campfire, watching the stars twinkle above, they both knew that this was just the beginning of their happily ever after."
Brad took a swallow of his drink. “Ask that nurse out. Go,"wherever she is. Pitch the idea to her, she might be into it.”","on your own, but don't be surprised if she says no, she's been",25,"on your own, but don't be surprised if she says no, she's been hurt before and it's going to take some time for her to trust someone again, and even then, it's not a guarantee that she'll say yes, but it's worth a shot, you never know what could happen, and it's not like you have anything to lose, just be genuine and see how it goes, and if she does say no, don't take it personally, it's not a reflection of your worth, and you can always try again with someone else, or maybe even try to be friends with her first, who knows, maybe that's the way to go, but either way, you'll never know unless you try, and that's the thing, isn't it, taking risks and putting yourself out there, it's scary, but it's also kind of exhilarating, and it's what makes life worth living, right, the unknown, the uncertainty, the possibility of something amazing happening, that's what makes it all worth it."
"“Yeah,” Brad said. “She dates you, you guys break up, and she rides happily into the sunset too. It’s a win-win. Seriously. This is your chance.",If you don’t do something you’re gonna spend the rest of your life sending women on to their forever families and never getting one for you.”,"to take a leap of faith and see if you two can make it work this time around, because let's be real, you've both been pining for each other for",52,"to take a leap of faith and see if you two can make it work this time around, because let's be real, you've both been pining for each other for years, and it's not like you're getting any younger, so what do you have to lose, right?

Brad looked me in the eye. “You will never find someone as long as all the women you date aren’t actually meant for you. You’re not their,soulmate. Their soulmate is the person they meet after you.

I already knew what he did for a living because Maddy had cyberstalked,"him.

Me: Not sure yet. I live with my best friend Maddy and we alternate who chooses,"where we’ll go next.

“But what if it isn’t? I’m just playing devil’s advocate here. What if it isn’t?

The only sound was the gentle lapping of the water against the shore, a soothing melody that seemed to calm the tension in the air.

"The bedrooms were off the living room on either side of a short hallway with a single bathroom shared in the middle.

The overall effect was one of quiet elegance, a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era when life moved at a slower pace, and the simple pleasures were savored with greater appreciation."

He grinned back and forth between us. “Maybe we can get together for dinner later this,"week, once you’ve gotten settled in,” he said. “Amber and I would love to have you.”","week, I'm buying, and we can try out that new Italian place that just opened up downtown.",32,"week, I'm buying, and we can try out that new Italian place that just opened up downtown."
It was never going to happen. I knew this. But Maddy wouldn’t let it go unless,"I tried—and really, I should try.

"I paused, not sure how much I wanted to share. I decided on all of it. Emma was going to","be here when it all hit the fan anyway, so there was no point in keeping her in the dark.","hear the whole story, every detail, every emotion, every thought that had been swirling in",40,"hear the whole story, every detail, every emotion, every thought that had been swirling in my mind since that fateful night, and I took a deep breath, preparing myself for the inevitable questions and reactions that would follow, wondering if she would still be able to look at me the same way after hearing the truth about my past, and the secrets I had kept hidden for so long."
"I studied the woman sitting next to me. Imagine someone who went through what she did, turning out the way she had. Able to give",grace to someone who’d let her down so badly. Emma was a better person than I was. And my life had been gentler than hers too.,"to smile and laugh with such warmth, to hold her head high, and to radiate a sense of peace that seemed almost otherworldly, especially",51,"to smile and laugh with such warmth, to hold her head high, and to radiate a sense of peace that seemed almost otherworldly, especially considering the depth of pain and hardship she must have endured, and yet, there was something about her that seemed almost...familiar, a quality that I couldn't quite put my finger on, a sense of resilience that I found myself drawn to, and as I continued to observe her, I began to wonder what her story was, what had led her to this place, and what secrets she might be hiding behind those calm, gentle eyes."
I might kiss her tonight. I almost did the other night at the,"dock, but then Amber showed up. I was looking forward to the do-over.","was the charity gala, but I restrained myself, not wanting to ruin the",26,"was the charity gala, but I restrained myself, not wanting to ruin the evening for her, or for myself, as the memory of that moment still lingers, a constant reminder of the unspoken tension between us."
I’d tried to be softer with her the last few days. The energy shift I’d had over Mom after my talk with Emma,"was almost as bad as being mad at her. At least when I was mad, I didn’t feel the guilt I was feeling now.","was a welcome change, but it seemed to have only made her more guarded, her responses to my attempts at conversation",47,"was a welcome change, but it seemed to have only made her more guarded, her responses to my attempts at conversation stilted and polite, like she was waiting for me to slip up so she could retreat back behind her walls."
"This was another thing I was trying not to think about—her leaving. I should be happy that she came at all, that she wasn’t in Hawaii. We still had three more dates, maybe more if I could convince her. I’d already gotten a freebie the other night at","Mom’s. But I dreaded the clock running out. Emma was the only good thing happening to me at the moment and when she was gone, not only would I lose her, I’d be left sitting in my new reality. Dad gone, Mom in prison.

But the thought of her leaving again, of being apart from her for another long stretch, was a hard pill to swallow. I'd grown accustomed to her presence, to the way she smiled at me across the table, to the way her eyes sparkled when she laughed. The thought of going back to just seeing her on the weekends, or worse, not seeing her at all, was a bleak one. I pushed the thoughts aside and focused on the present, on the fact that she was here now, and I had her all to myself for the next few days. I took a deep breath and tried to shake off the anxiety that had been building up inside me, but it was hard to ignore the feeling that time was running out, and I needed to make the most of it."
"“Yeah,” I said. “Thank you. There’s actually something else you can help me with too,” I","said, looking at them. “I need help making sure I can still see Emma until she goes.”","do.

I've tried searching online, but I haven't been able to find any information about it, and I was hoping you might be able to help me dig up some leads. Do you think that's something you could help me with, or would you know someone who might be able to assist me?"
Emma pulled two Ziploc bags from her purse. They had Wheat Thins and celery in them. Probably her,"work snacks. “I trust this zipper seal with my life,” she said, turning to hand them to our passengers.","snack was a leftover from a meeting at the office, but she couldn't quite remember which one, and the stale",37,"snack was a leftover from a meeting at the office, but she couldn't quite remember which one, and the stale crackers and limp celery sticks seemed to mock her as she stared at them, wondering why she had even bothered packing them in the first place."
"I think I would have been embarrassed if I’d been on a date with anyone else. My mother, sobbing drunk the night before",she left for prison. But I knew Emma didn’t judge. That’s just not how she was.

"When she finished handing out Kleenex, Emma stayed turned in her seat.","“You know,” she said, “I worked for three months in a women’s prison.”","glanced around the crowded movie theater, her eyes scanning the dimly lit",25,"glanced around the crowded movie theater, her eyes scanning the dimly lit room for any sign of her friends, who were supposed to meet her there for the midnight premiere of the new superhero film."
It was funny that two pivotal moments in my life were happening at the exact same time and at complete odds with each,other.

"What did I have to offer her? I had nothing but baggage. Emotionally damaged, traumatized children that had been catapulted from one tragedy to the next, and me, barely keeping my head above water. Would I even have the time or the bandwidth to be any kind of partner while I was helping my",siblings navigate this situation?

The thought of adding another person to this chaotic mix, of trying to be a partner, a friend, a confidant, a lover, it seemed like an insurmountable task, one that would only lead to more heartache and more pain. And yet, as I looked at her, I couldn't help but feel a spark of hope, a glimmer of possibility, a sense that maybe, just maybe, we could find a way to heal together, to support each other through the darkness, and emerge stronger on the other side."

"“Emma, go meet him at the door, or I will lose my shit. I didn’t push a clunky car stroller around the universe’s largest mall for five hours so you could shake hands","with this guy on the way out.

"I always thought it was a proximity thing. She traveled a lot, she changed jobs all the time, she was busy, she","was dealing with whatever Amber dealt with.

He nodded over his shoulder. “I should probably let you get back to work. I have to go pick,"up Alex and take him to a doctor’s appointment.” He paused. “Am I allowed to hug you goodbye, or…?”","up my sister from the airport, she's arriving late from a business trip.

I took her hand and did my best to make my face straight. People were already stopping to watch.

"After we finished with the lice, I set up the blanket in the backyard. With the landscaping Mom did, it was pretty nice back there with its hanging lights, citronella candles, and magnolia trees. I ordered a","pizza, connected my phone to a Bluetooth speaker, and poured the wine I brought, and Emma and I hung out and talked.

"“I have the van,” he said, his hands wandering. “Alex can’t drive it yet, so",it’s just sitting there.
