I [29m] have been friends with Chad [32m] since we were born. Our moms are best friends and we grew,"up together and were roommates for the last 10 years, up until the incident that set our current situation into motion.",41,"up together, sharing countless memories and creating a bond that only siblings could understand. Chad's family would often come over to my house for dinner, and my family would reciprocate the same hospitality, making our friendship feel more like a big, happy family. As we grew older, our friendship only deepened, and we found ourselves confiding in each other about our hopes, dreams, and fears, creating a sense of trust and loyalty that has endured through the years."
"Anyway, forward to five months ago. I dated Hope [28f] for a few weeks. Not a big deal. We decided we weren’t feeling it, no chemistry, so we called it quits. And then lo and behold she hits","it off with Chad. Of course in true Good Luck Charm fashion, this means Chad is her soulmate. Chad is all googly-eyed over her, they’ve met the parents, they’re ring shopping—and they want to move in together. Immediately.",76,"and I was surprised to see her pop up on my social media, seemingly out of the blue, with a new profile picture and a cryptic message that left me wondering if she was trying to reconnect or just seeking closure. At first, I thought nothing of it, but as the days went by and I kept seeing her name trending in my notifications, I started to feel a pang of curiosity and a hint of unease, wondering what had brought her back into my life after all this time, and whether our brief encounter had left a lasting impact on her, just as it had on me."
"The only problem is that Chad has six more months on our lease but found a perfect new house for him and Hope, and he can’t afford to pay rent on two places at the same",time. So he had to make the difficult decision to screw me over or screw her over—and he picked me. Now I have to find a way to cover his rent until the lease is up.,72,"time, which would put us in a difficult financial situation, especially since we've already spent a significant amount on renovations to our current home, and the thought of finding a new tenant on short notice is daunting, not to mention the stress of dealing with a potential eviction, which could damage our credit scores and make it even harder to find a new place, so we need to figure out a solution that works for everyone, but it's not going to be easy."
"I’m annoyed, but I decided to try to find a reason to spend more time outside so I don’t have to stare out my window. I’ve always wanted a dog, but Chad would never agree to it. So I went to a rescue and found the ugliest animal there. The one so hideous, nobody else wanted it. This dog’s got an underbite and mange, and he’s missing half an","ear. He’s a little Brussels Griffon, so he’s got that deep frown—he looks like a judgmental gremlin. I adopted him and named him Chad since the dog is now my new best friend. If you’re reading this, you’re dead to me, human Chad. (Not really, I still love the guy.) But I tag him in the captions of every Chad the Dog Instagram post with “Look, a loyal Chad!”",138,"ear, but there was something about him that made me feel a connection. Maybe it was the way he wagged his tail despite his condition, or the way he looked up at me with those big brown eyes. Whatever it was, I knew I had to take him home. I named him Ugly and brought him back to my apartment, where Chad was less than thrilled to meet our new addition. ""What is this?"" he asked, eyeing Ugly's mangy fur and crooked teeth. I tried to explain that I'd found him at the rescue, but Chad just shook his head. ""We can't keep him,"" he said. ""He's a mess."" But I was determined to prove him wrong. I spent hours researching ways to help Ugly feel better, from medicated shampoos to special diets. And slowly but surely, he began to transform. His fur grew in thicker and healthier, and his underbite became less noticeable. People started to comment on how cute he was, and Chad even began to soften. He'd scratch Ugly behind the ears and give him treats, and I could see the affection growing between them. It was amazing to watch, and I was grateful that I'd taken a chance on this ugly dog. As the months passed, Ugly became a beloved member of our family, and I realized that sometimes, the things that make us different are what make us special. I was glad I'd ignored Chad's reservations and brought Ugly home, and I knew that our lives were richer for it."
I tilted my head so my braid fell to one side and held up four fingers. Maddy,"didn’t look happy, but she took the picture with my phone, then handed it back to me.",34,"was about to count them, but I hesitated, unsure if she'd understand the gesture, and instead asked her to guess how old I was, her eyes sparkling with amusement as she tried to calculate, her brow furrowed in concentration."
"“That dog trusts him,” Maddy said. “And that’s a rescue dog, so that means something. They’re usually all","skittish and freaked out.” She went quiet again looking at his wall. “Go down further,” Maddy said. “The billboard.”",37,"very wary of strangers, but this one seems to have taken a liking to him, which is quite unusual, especially given the fact that he's a stray and has had to fend for himself for so long, but maybe that's exactly why he's so trusting, because he's learned to rely on his instincts and trust his gut, and if he's chosen to trust this person, then maybe there's something special about him that we can't quite see yet, and it's worth exploring further, because sometimes the most unlikely of friendships can lead to the most profound connections and discoveries, and who are we to question the instincts of a rescue dog who's been through so much, maybe he knows something that we don't, and maybe this person is exactly what he needs, and vice versa, and it's all about giving them a chance to prove it, and seeing where this unexpected bond takes them, and what they might learn from each other, and how it might change them both in ways they never thought possible."
That night after work Maddy made dinner. Grilled portobello mushrooms and rice pilaf. I did,"the dishes and cleaned the kitchen, then took a shower and blew out my hair.",30,"not know what to expect, but the aroma wafting from the kitchen was tantalizing, and my stomach growled in anticipation as I took a seat at the table, watching Maddy expertly juggle multiple pans and utensils with a practiced ease that I had grown accustomed to over the years of our relationship."
"“Sorry, I had to give Brad his dewormer. I brought some for",you too. Faith said you’ve been dragging your ass on the carpet?”,24,"my other pets, but I didn't think he needed it, but his stool was a bit loose this morning, so I figured it was better to be safe than sorry, and now he's looking a bit more comfortable, but I'm not sure if it was really necessary, I mean, he's a pretty healthy dog, but I guess you can never be too careful when it comes to parasites, and I've heard that some dewormers can have side effects, but I'm sure it's fine, I've given it to him before and he's always been okay, but still, I feel a bit guilty for giving him something he might not have needed, maybe I should have just observed him for a bit longer before administering the medication, but I didn't want to take any chances, and now I'm just going to keep an eye on him and see how he reacts, and maybe I'll give him a treat to make up for it, he loves treats, and I'm sure he'll forgive me eventually, but still, I wish I had been more confident in my decision, maybe I should have consulted with the vet before giving it to him, but I didn't want to bother them, and now I'm just going to wait and see how things go, and hope that everything turns out okay."
My best friend was in a Hawaiian shirt and pink cargo shorts. He was a general manager at Trader Joe’s. I missed not having to go to the grocery store now,"that he had moved out. Actually, I missed a lot of things now that Brad had moved out. Like having another human to talk to, even if it was this one.",62,"that I could just order everything online and have it delivered to my doorstep, but sometimes I still found myself wandering through the aisles, reminiscing about the good old days when we would browse the shelves together, sampling exotic cheeses and discussing the merits of different types of olive oil, and I would catch glimpses of him, always impeccably dressed in his Hawaiian shirt and pink cargo shorts, as he expertly navigated the crowds, a true master of the store, and I would smile, remembering the countless times he had helped me find the perfect ingredient for a recipe, or recommended a new product that would become a staple in my kitchen, and I would feel grateful for the friendship we shared, one that went beyond just shopping for groceries, but was a deep and abiding connection that transcended the mundane tasks of everyday life."
"“This is true,” Brad said, looking at his phone. “We are",assholes. But only to each other. It’s the foundation of our friendship.”,23,"on the verge of a major breakthrough, and I think we should proceed with caution, considering the potential implications of our discovery."
"Brad nodded at me. “You know, if she’s got the same thing you do,","if you guys date each other, you’ll both find your soulmates when you break up.”",29,"it's possible that she's been experiencing similar symptoms, and we should consider running some tests to confirm whether it's a genetic condition or not, and if so, what the underlying cause might be, and whether there are any potential treatments available, and maybe even some preventative measures we can take to avoid passing it on to future generations, and I know it's a lot to consider, but I think it's worth exploring further, especially if it could potentially impact her health and well-being in the long run."
They were starting to do the couples thing for all the trips and birthdays. They were all going up,"to Lutsen in October to go hiking. They asked me if I wanted to go, but I didn’t. Not alone.",39,"to the cabin for the weekend, and even though they had been together for a while, it still felt like a novelty to see them holding hands and laughing together, their love growing stronger with each passing day, and it was clear that they were meant to be, a perfect match in every way."
Brad took a swallow of his drink. “Ask that nurse out. Go,"wherever she is. Pitch the idea to her, she might be into it.”",25,"on your own, but don't be surprised if she says no, because she seems to be the kind of person who values her independence and may not appreciate the pressure, and besides, you've only known her for a short time, so it's probably too soon to be making any kind of romantic overtures, but still, it couldn't hurt to try, and who knows, maybe she'll be flattered by the invitation and agree to go out with you, but either way, it's worth a shot, right?"
"“Yeah,” Brad said. “She dates you, you guys break up, and she rides happily into the sunset too. It’s a win-win. Seriously. This is your chance.",If you don’t do something you’re gonna spend the rest of your life sending women on to their forever families and never getting one for you.”,52,"to take a leap of faith and see if you two can make it work this time around, because let's be real, you've both been pining for each other for years, and it's not like you're getting any younger, so what do you have to lose, right? Maybe this time will be different, maybe you'll finally figure out what went wrong last time and be able to move forward together, and who knows, maybe you'll even get your happily ever after, but if not, well, at least you'll know you tried, and that's all anyone can really ask for, so what do you say, are you in?"
Brad looked me in the eye. “You will never find someone as long as all the women you date aren’t actually meant for you. You’re not their,soulmate. Their soulmate is the person they meet after you. It’s decided the minute it starts. They are literally fated not to be The One. Think about it.”,55,"type, and it's not just about finding someone who checks all the boxes on your list, but about finding someone who sees beyond those boxes and loves you for who you truly are, flaws and all."
"I had actually thought about her. I’d checked once or twice to see if she’d messaged me again. She hadn’t. The last message was me telling her it was nice chatting with her, three days ago. Trying to keep talking to her was a dead end if she","lived somewhere else. But I don’t know. Maybe Brad had a point. What could it hurt to try? Worst-case scenario, I’d spend some time and money and have no connection with her. What was new? I was already doing that with every date that didn’t pan out anyway.",96,"wasn't interested, and I had to accept that. It was a conversation that had started out so promisingly, with laughter and shared interests, but now it seemed to have fizzled out. I wondered if I'd misread the signs, if I'd been too eager to think there was something more to it. I'd been so caught up in the excitement of a potential connection that I hadn't considered the possibility that she might not feel the same way. Now, as I sat there staring at my phone, I couldn't help but feel a pang of disappointment and a hint of embarrassment at my own foolishness. I'd been so sure that we had a spark, but it seemed I'd been wrong. I took a deep breath and tried to shake off the feeling, telling myself that there were plenty of other people out there, and that I'd find someone who was a better match for me. But the memory of her smile and her laugh lingered in my mind, making it hard to let go."
I already knew what he did for a living because Maddy had cyberstalked,"him. Of course I couldn’t tell him that, so I had to ask questions.",27,"him for weeks, and I had to intervene before things got out of hand, but I still couldn't help feeling a mix of emotions as I watched him walk towards me with a hint of a smile on his face, his eyes locked onto mine with a sense of familiarity and a dash of curiosity, and I wondered what he would say or do next."
Me: Not sure yet. I live with my best friend Maddy and we alternate who chooses,"where we’ll go next. She picked Hawaii, and I haven’t decided where to go after that.",32,"gets to pick the movie for movie night, but tonight it's her turn and she's been teasing me all day about choosing something romantic and sappy, while I'm secretly hoping she'll pick an action-packed blockbuster to get my adrenaline pumping, but as I glance at the stack of DVDs on the coffee table, I start to feel a sense of trepidation, wondering if she's actually going to surprise me with a rom-com after all."
"For a moment I debated calling from a blocked number. He was nice, but I still didn’t know him. But I figured it",was just as easy to block him later if he got creepy. I dialed and he picked up on the first ring. “Emma.”,46,"had to take a chance, and besides, I had already told him my name, so it wasn't like I was completely anonymous, and I couldn't shake the feeling that he was genuinely interested in getting to know me, and I had to admit, I was curious about him too, and his warm, deep voice still lingered in my mind, making me wonder what he looked like, and whether he was as charming in person as he sounded on the phone, and I found myself smiling at the thought of seeing him again, and maybe, just maybe, this could be the start of something special."
“But what if it isn’t? I’m just playing devil’s advocate here. What if it isn’t? Brad said that everyone I’m serious enough to date more than twice is cosmically destined for someone else.” He went quiet for,"a beat. “Does nobody feel right to you? Like, there’s just enough there to give it a little go, but then the bottom falls out? Is that just me? Or is it like that for you also?”",74,"seemed to be contemplating the weight of his words, his eyes drifting off into the distance as if searching for answers in the stars. The dim lighting of the café cast a warm glow on his face, but his expression remained somber, a mixture of concern and curiosity etched on his features. He took a sip of his coffee, the silence between us growing thicker than the fog outside, as if the very fate he spoke of was hovering just beyond the edge of our conversation, waiting to be acknowledged."
"“Look,” he said. “I know the idea’s a little out there. But if this is actually a thing, we’re in a pretty low-risk/high-reward situation. We’d just have to hang out a few times and","then stop. That’s it. If what Brad said is true and we can’t find our person because everyone we’re interested in is meant for someone else, I would actually really like it if it stopped.”",69,"see how things go, maybe get to know each other a bit better, and then we can reassess the situation and decide if it's worth pursuing further. I mean, it's not like we're asking for a long-term commitment or anything, just a casual get-together to see if there's any potential. And if it doesn't work out, no big deal, we can just go back to our normal lives. But if it does, well, who knows, maybe we'll be onto something big here. I've done my research, and I'm not saying it's a guarantee or anything, but I think it's worth a shot. What do you say, are you in?"
"I nodded and put up a finger. “I’ve got to go,”",I said into the phone. “Maddy wants to watch a movie.”,22,"get some fresh air, I need to clear my head and process everything that just happened."
"Maddy looked annoyed. “Probably didn’t pay the bill. You know, for someone who asks you for as","much money as she does, she sure ends up in collections a lot. God, I hate her.”",34,"much as they do, they can be pretty cheap when it comes to their own expenses. I swear, I've seen it happen before, and it's always the same story: they expect everyone else to pick up the tab, but when it's time for them to pay, they suddenly develop a case of amnesia. I'm starting to think that's exactly what's going on here."
I looked away from her. My relationship with my mother was complicated. It,"wasn’t complicated for Maddy though, she knew exactly how she felt about it.",26,"had always been a delicate balance of love, guilt, and resentment, with moments of tenderness and anger that could shift in an instant, like the unpredictable tides of the ocean, and I often found myself wondering if I was more like her than I cared to admit, or if I was simply a product of her influence, a reflection of the complexities that had shaped her own life, and the lives of those around her."
"I’d stopped calling jails and hospitals years ago when this kind of thing happened. Filing a missing person’s report was a waste of time. Amber moved too fast, was too impulsive. She’d go to",a concert and climb onto a tour bus and end up across the US. Or she’d meet a guy at a bar and get invited to live on his boat for four months in Florida.,69,"be gone for days, sometimes weeks, and then turn up again, unscathed and unrepentant, with some wild story about how she'd been on a road trip or working on a film set. But this time was different. This time, she'd been gone for three days, and her phone was dead, and her friends were getting worried. I'd tried calling her, texting her, but there was nothing. No response, no sign of life. I'd even gone to her apartment, but it was dark and quiet, the curtains drawn, the air thick with an unsettling stillness. I'd stopped calling jails and hospitals years ago when this kind of thing happened, but now I was starting to wonder if I'd made a terrible mistake. Maybe I should have done something, said something, done something to stop her from leaving. But what could I have done? She was a grown woman, after all, with a mind of her own. And yet, as I stood there, staring at the empty apartment, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was somehow responsible for her disappearance."
"“I don’t understand how that woman made this,” Maddy said, going on,",waving a hand over my face. “A fully functional member of society.”,24,"to examine the intricate patterns and delicate stitches that seemed to dance across the fabric, her eyes scanning every detail with a mixture of fascination and skepticism, as if searching for some hidden clue or secret behind the craftsmanship."
This is where we always landed with Mom. Maddy being furious on my,behalf and me reminding her that Mom wasn’t all bad. Sometimes she was wonderful.,27,"was the reason why she stormed out of the car and slammed the door, leaving me to wonder what I had done wrong this time, as the engine sputtered and died in the deserted parking lot."
"When my mother was at her best, you could meet her and walk away thinking you’d been in","the presence of a Muse or an angel. This witty, enchanting woman who made you feel interesting and special.",37,"the presence of a completely different person, so effortlessly did she change her demeanor to suit the occasion, and with a smile that could light up a room, she would effortlessly weave a spell of warmth and kindness that left a lasting impression on all who encountered her, and it was as if she had a special gift for making everyone feel seen and heard, a gift that she used to bring people together and create a sense of community wherever she went, and though she may have had her flaws, her good qualities far outweighed them, and it was these qualities that made her such a beloved figure in the lives of those who knew her."
"Maddy’s moms were my foster parents. They’d wanted to be my real parents, but it just never felt right. I had a mom. And I was fourteen when they got me. The imprinting didn’t take. That’s all I could say about it, it just didn’t take. I cared about them.",I called on their birthdays and came back with Maddy for Christmas when we could get it off. They just weren’t… mine. And Maddy knew it. It bothered her. She couldn’t wrap her brain around it and I couldn’t explain it to her in any way that she found acceptable.,100,"They were good people, kind and loving, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I didn't belong with them. I remembered my real mom, the one who had given birth to me, and the pain of being separated from her still lingered. I had been told that she was gone, that I was better off with my foster family, but the ache in my heart refused to subside. I tried to push the thoughts away, to focus on the life I had now, but they lingered, a constant reminder of what could never be. My foster parents, Maddy's moms, were patient with me, understanding that I was still healing, still trying to come to terms with my past. They gave me space, allowed me to process my emotions, and for that, I was grateful. But the truth was, I was still searching for my real mom, still hoping to find her, to reconnect with the one person who had given me life. It was a longing that I couldn't explain, a yearning that seemed to grow stronger with each passing day."
"Maddy hadn’t come back last night, as promised, and I guess the date went well because he was taking her to breakfast",and then some art exhibit. She wouldn’t be home until dinner. I was off and had nothing to do and nowhere to be.,45,"at that trendy new café downtown, judging by the Instagram story she posted this morning, and I'm starting to feel a little left out, wondering if I'll ever find someone who shares my passions and interests, not just my Netflix password and favorite pizza toppings."
"“Yeah, it had rope bridges and everything. We were on a quick two-week assignment","to Atlanta. Maddy and I had to share a bed, but it was so cool.”",29,"in a remote village, and the local guides had warned us about the treacherous terrain and unpredictable weather conditions, but nothing could have prepared us for the eerie atmosphere that settled over us as night began to fall, casting long shadows across the makeshift bridges and making the creaking of the wooden planks sound like the whispers of the forest itself."
“Not today. But when I had lunch with them yesterday we talked about the Reddit thread. I told them about,"you, obviously,” he said. “That’s when Brad gave me his prophecy about you and I being able to break the curse.”",41,"the recent developments in the field and how it's gaining traction among the younger generation, but they seemed skeptical about its potential impact on the industry as a whole, and I couldn't help but wonder if they were right to be cautious, given the mixed signals coming from the market and the fact that some of the key players are still hesitant to fully commit to the new technology, which has left me questioning whether we're on the cusp of a revolution or just experiencing a fleeting trend."
“That is exactly what I was telling Maddy a few weeks ago. Some guy proposed,in front of a whole stadium at this game we went to—and the girl said no.”,31,"to her at the coffee shop, and she was completely taken aback by his forwardness, but I guess that's just the kind of thing that happens when you're in a big city like this, where people are always pushing boundaries and testing the limits of social norms, and it's not uncommon for strangers to strike up conversations with each other in public places, especially if they're both sitting alone at a small table by the window, sipping their lattes and trying to enjoy the quiet morning atmosphere, but still, it's not every day that someone asks you to marry them after just meeting, and Maddy was definitely taken aback by the proposal, but she's a free spirit, so she didn't say no right away, and instead, she asked him a few questions, like how he knew she was the one, and what made him think they were compatible, and he seemed sincere in his answers, so she decided to take a chance and see where things went, and now they're actually considering taking their relationship to the next level, which is pretty surprising, considering how things started out, but I guess you never know what's going to happen when you least expect it, and love can strike at any moment, even in the most unexpected ways."
I pulled up to the high school pickup line and put the car,"in park, then grabbed my phone to look at the picture of Emma. Again.",27,"in park, waiting for my best friend, Emily, to finish her last class of the day, and as I gazed out at the crowded parking lot, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and nervousness about the upcoming school dance, which was just a week away, and I had been stressing over what to wear and who to ask to be my date, but Emily's infectious laughter and bright smile as she skipped towards the car quickly lifted my spirits and we spent the next few minutes catching up on each other's weekends and gossiping about our classmates, but as we chatted, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, and it wasn't until Emily mentioned that she had seen our classmate, Alex, arguing with the school's star quarterback, Jake, earlier that day that I realized what was bothering me, and I knew I had to know more about what had happened."
"A bell rang and kids started pouring out. The last day of summer school. When I saw my brother, Alex, walking with a","group of his friends toward the buses, I rolled down the passenger side window and leaned across the seat. “Hey! Need a ride?”",46,"smile on his face, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions - excitement for the freedom that summer brought, but also a hint of sadness for the end of a chapter in our lives, as we had grown so accustomed to the routine of summer school, and the thought of returning to the monotony of a regular school year seemed daunting, especially with the looming prospect of new teachers, new classmates, and new challenges that awaited us, but Alex's infectious grin quickly lifted my spirits, and I couldn't wait to see what adventures the summer had in store for us."
"I got up. “I gotta get going,” I said flatly. “Want me to run",this up to Sarah?” I nodded at the bag of food for my sister.,28,"along with you to the station, or would you rather I drop you off at the corner of Main and Elm?"
"I came in and looked around. “This is new,” I said. She had red LED string lights along",the walls. The whole bedroom was bathed in red. It was sort of depressing. “I got you McDonald’s.”,36,"the walls, a small Christmas tree on the coffee table, and a plate of cookies on the kitchen counter, which seemed to be a deliberate attempt to create a festive atmosphere, but it only made me feel more out of place, as if I had stumbled into a stranger's home, and I couldn't help but wonder what had brought her to this point, where she felt the need to decorate her space in such a way, and what was behind the forced cheer that seemed to emanate from every corner of the room."
Maddy looked up. Then her eyes dropped to the laptop I was holding and she somehow immediately,"knew what was about to happen. “No.” She shook her head. “No. No, no, no, no, no. NO.”",35,"seemed to understand the significance of the open browser window, her gaze lingering on the search history and the highlighted words that read ""your name"" and ""missing person"" in bold letters."
"As we started pulling our bags from the trunk, a brown-haired middle-aged woman came out of",the side of the three-car garage. “Are you Emma?” she said in a thick Mexican accent.,32,"the house, her eyes scanning the scene before her with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion, her gaze lingering on our group for a moment before she turned back to the open door, as if searching for someone or something else, her expression unreadable behind a veil of polite indifference, and yet, there was something in her demeanor that hinted at a deeper story, a story that seemed to be connected to the old mansion and its mysterious past, a story that only she knew, and was perhaps reluctant to share."
"Maddy scoffed quietly. “Yeah, I don’t think we’re going to",lose the house. They can probably see it from space.”,20,"make it to the summit before nightfall, not with this storm brewing and the terrain getting increasingly treacherous by the minute."
Maddy must have been thinking the same thing I was. “Does it rain a,"lot in Minnesota?” she asked, raising her voice over the sound of the old motor.",29,"lot in this city, or is it just a myth that people keep talking about?"
We lugged our bags up the stairs and were sweating by the time we made it to the door. We came in through a screened-in porch that overlooked the lake. Maddy and,I shared a glance. It was adorable. White wicker rocking chairs and a small matching loveseat with thick floral cushions. A cute coffee table and plastic ferns in wrought-iron planters and hanging baskets.,65,"was already sitting on the couch, her eyes fixed on the water as if lost in thought. The air inside was thick with the scent of old books and stale air, a smell that seemed to cling to every surface like a damp shroud. We dropped our bags on the floor and made our way over to her, the creaking of the old wooden floorboards beneath our feet echoing through the silence. Maddy looked up as we approached, her eyes red-rimmed and puffy, and for a moment, we just stood there, unsure of what to say or do. The only sound was the gentle lapping of the water against the shore, a soothing melody that seemed to calm the tension in the air. It was as if the lake was trying to tell us something, but we weren't quite sure what."
"The bedrooms were off the living room on either side of a short hallway with a single bathroom shared in the middle. The bathroom had a white claw-foot tub, pale blue","tile, and an old pedestal sink. I took the room with the cushioned reading nook in the window and Maddy picked the one with the hanging swing chair in the corner.",62,"and a matching sink, its porcelain gleaming in the soft light that filtered through the frosted glass window above the tub. The walls were painted a pale yellow, a color that seemed to glow warmly in the morning sunlight that streamed through the windows, casting a sense of serenity over the entire space. The bathroom was small, but it was well-appointed, with a linen closet and a medicine cabinet, and a large mirror above the sink that reflected the entire room. The overall effect was one of understated elegance, a sense of refinement that was carried through to the rest of the house."
"Four hours later, Maddy and I were back at the cottage sitting in the screened-in porch.",We’d had dinner in town and then boated back. The fridge was stocked up and we’d unpacked.,33,"surrounded by the soothing sounds of nature, sipping sweet tea and trying to process the events that had transpired, the warm sunlight casting a golden glow over the tranquil scene, as we both struggled to come to terms with the revelation that had shaken us to our core."
She looked away from me. “Emma…” Her eyes came back to mine. “Please. Please do it.,Do it now before you lose the chance to meet them altogether. People don’t live forever.”,32,"for my sake, I know it's the only way to save you, to save us, from the darkness that's closing in, and I'll do it, I'll do whatever it takes to keep you safe, even if it means sacrificing my own happiness."
"“How about this,” Maddy said. “Run your DNA and make your account private. We’ll change your privacy settings for a few minutes, poke around. If you have any","relatives out there, we’ll screenshot it and go back to private. Then I’ll go and find them online and tell you if they seem like people worth knowing.”",56,"information that's sensitive or incriminating, it will be locked down before anyone can access it. We'll also set up a temporary email address and phone number, just in case you need to verify your identity or receive any important messages. And if you're really worried, we can even create a new, burner account for you to use in the meantime. But first, let's get your DNA results and see if there's anything there that might explain what's going on. I've already set up the DNA testing kit, it's just a simple cheek swab, and we can get the results back in a few hours. In the meantime, I'll start digging into your online activity and see if I can find any clues about what might be happening. It's going to be a long night, but I'm sure we'll get to the bottom of this."
We prioritized power for the coffee maker first and we brewed a pot while I sat in the kitchen with,"a towel wrapped around my head. When it was done, Maddy poured me a cup and handed it to me.",40,"my eyes fixed on the clock, the aroma of freshly ground coffee filling the air, and the soft hum of the machine a soothing background noise as I waited for the brew to finish, my mind wandering to the long day ahead."
The snail’s-pace speed the pontoon put out somehow seemed faster with the beach approaching. Maddy threw it in reverse. The engine,"downshifted miserably, but we started to slow. Then to my horror we began to move backward, motor first, right into the dock.",43,"roared to life, but the pontoon's momentum carried it forward, and it scraped against the hull of a nearby boat, causing a loud screech that echoed across the calm waters. Maddy's heart sank as she struggled to regain control, her mind racing with the thought of the impending collision and the potential damage it could cause."
"When we were safely away from anything we could crash into, Maddy killed the engine and slumped in the captain’s","seat. “If we’d been on the other side of the dock, we could have hit the yacht,” she said, looking shaken.",41,"chair, letting out a sigh of relief as the silence enveloped us, a stark contrast to the chaos we had just escaped, and I couldn't help but glance over at her, trying to gauge the extent of her exhaustion, her eyes fixed on some point outside the cockpit, her face a mask of calm, but I knew better, I knew the toll this journey had taken on her, and I reached out, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder, feeling a surge of protectiveness towards her, as the darkness outside seemed to press in around us, the only sound the gentle hum of the engine's cooling system, and the soft creak of the wooden trim, a reminder that we were still afloat, still alive, and still had a long way to go before we could find safety."
"I lined the nose of the boat up with the side of the dock and started for it again, only this time I killed the thrust earlier. We",coasted along the side and I put us into reverse to slow us down while Maddy grabbed one of the dock poles and we came to a stop.,56,"had to wait for the boat to drift closer to the dock, the water lapping gently against the hull as I carefully maneuvered the vessel into position, the silence broken only by the occasional call of a seagull overhead."
"Her phone rang. “Oh, hold on. I have to leave my ringer on in case Maddy gets in trouble trying to get back.” She looked at it. “It’s her.” She swiped and put the",phone to her ear. “Maddy? Are you okay?” She listened for a second and then glanced at me. “Okay.” Then she hung up. She nodded over her shoulder. “Can we go down there really quick?”,69,"phone to her ear, her voice softening as she heard Maddy's frantic tone on the other end. ""Hey, kiddo, what's wrong? You sound upset. What happened?"" She listened intently, her brow furrowed in concern, as Maddy's words spilled out in a jumbled mess of tears and sobs. ""Okay, okay, I'm on my way. Just stay where you are, I'll be there in a few minutes."" She hung up the phone and quickly grabbed her keys, already heading for the door, her mind racing with worst-case scenarios."
I hadn’t really cared too much that Benny might not be here today. He wasn’t the point of this visit. But all that,had changed in the last ten minutes. Now I wanted my friends to meet her so I had someone to talk to about her.,47,"changed when I saw the look on his mother's face, a mix of sadness and desperation that I had never seen before, and I realized that Benny's absence was more than just a simple no-show, it was a reflection of the turmoil that had been brewing beneath the surface of our small town for weeks, a sense that something was off, and I couldn't shake the feeling that Benny's disappearance was somehow connected to the strange occurrences that had been happening in the days leading up to his vanishing, the unexplained noises in the night, the eerie feeling of being watched, and the whispered rumors of a dark presence lurking in the shadows, and I knew that I had to find out what was going on, not just for Benny's sake, but for the sake of our entire community."
Jane led us through their living room and down a hall and stopped,by a closed door. “Everything’s ready. You guys can go in when you want.”,27,"in front of a door that was slightly ajar, and with a gentle push, it swung open to reveal a cozy study filled with books and papers scattered all over the room, and a large wooden desk in the center, where a single chair sat, as if waiting for someone to return to it, the air thick with the scent of old leather and dust."
"Her phone rang and she picked it up and looked at it. “Oh, hold on, it’s Maddy. Hello?” She listened for a moment. Then she sucked","air through her teeth. “That’s what the bumpers are for. Well I’m glad you made it, I was worried. Okay. Okay. I will. Bye.” She hung up.",53,"in a deep breath, trying to compose herself before responding, ""Hey, Maddy, what's up?"" She paused, her mind racing with possibilities, as Maddy's voice on the other end of the line seemed to convey a mix of excitement and concern, and she could sense that whatever it was, it was big, and it was going to change everything."
“I hope so. It’s been a little stressful.” She picked up Murder Mittens. “I don’t think I really thought this island thing through. It,"sounded like a good idea at the time but it’s kind of inconvenient. Anyway, it’s only for six weeks and Maddy likes the cottage, so…”",49,"was a spontaneous decision, and now that I'm here, I'm not sure if I'm ready for the isolation and the responsibility of taking care of this cat."
The woman’s eyes moved back and forth over the mouth of her open,Coach bag. Emma took her gently by the elbow. “I’m Emma. What’s your name?”,27,"door, as if searching for something or someone, her gaze lingering on the faint outline of a figure standing just beyond the threshold, partially hidden in the shadows."
Maddy was already off the pontoon and running toward me across the beach. She skidded to,"a halt in front of me, still catching her breath from the sprint. “This bitch,” she managed.",33,"stop just a few feet away, her eyes wide with a mix of fear and urgency, and I could see the panic rising in her chest as she tried to catch her breath, her voice barely above a whisper as she shouted my name, ""Emily, Emily, come quick, it's happening, the storm is coming, we have to get out of here, now."""
"Amber was in a flowing white-and-peach chiffon summer dress with a slit up the thigh. Her long brown hair was down, she had on a floppy wide-brimmed hat and huge sunglasses. She was carrying","a bottle of champagne in one hand and her sandals in the other, dangling off the tips of her fingers. She was beaming, running toward us across the beach, kicking up sand. “Emma!” She laughed.",69,"a large straw tote bag slung over her shoulder, filled with an assortment of colorful beach towels, a water bottle, and a book by her favorite author, as she walked along the sun-kissed beach, the warm sand shifting beneath her bare feet, the sound of the waves gently lapping at the shore creating a soothing melody that seemed to match the rhythm of her heart, and the salty sea air filling her lungs with its invigorating scent, making her feel carefree and alive, as she strolled towards the quaint little beachside café, where she had promised to meet her friends for a mid-morning coffee and a lively discussion about their latest book club selection."
"“Emma, you won’t believe my day,” she said, looking back at me. “So I wanted to surprise you. I flew all the way over here on","a red-eye, got an Uber, and came out to the address you gave me, but when I knocked on the door this handsome man answered instead.”",52,"my own, and I have to say, it was quite the adventure. I took a small plane from the local airfield, and then I had to navigate through a bit of turbulence, but the view from up high was breathtaking. I saw the entire city spread out below me like a patchwork quilt, and it was truly awe-inspiring. When I landed, I hailed a taxi and headed straight to your place, but I got stuck in traffic, which made me late. I'm so sorry for that, but I hope you can forgive me. I brought you a little something to make up for it – a souvenir from my travels, and I think you'll really like it."
“Are you kidding me with this?” Maddy hissed as soon as they were out,of earshot. “She’s here for what? Six hours? And she’s already hypnotized our landlord?”,28,"of the crowded restaurant, her voice barely above a whisper as she glared at her friend, Emily, who was still grinning mischievously, clearly enjoying the shock on Maddy's face."
Maddy crossed her arms. “What she always does? Show up and leave a path of,"destruction in her wake? She’s not staying with us,” she said in her end-of-discussion voice.",30,"destruction in her wake, leaving everyone else to pick up the pieces and wonder what hit them."
Maddy rolled her eyes in the way that I knew meant she was aware. “Please tell me I don’t have to stay and watch,you eat crustaceans with that woman. Let’s just go back to the island and you see her tomorrow or something when she’s done with what’s-his-face.”,49,"the entire presentation, which was going to be a slideshow of her aunt's vacation photos from last year."
I watched him walk to the beach and I let out a long breath. Maddy was right.,"This was bad. Mom never left anywhere on good terms. Not jobs, or apartments, or relationships. Especially relationships.",35,"it was a good thing I had decided to trust her instincts, because as I followed him at a distance, I saw him meet up with a group of people who seemed to be waiting for him, their faces shrouded in the fading light of day, their intentions unclear."
I felt relieved the instant he said he would stay with me because it let Maddy off the hook. She would walk through hell for,me—and this cookout was her hell. I was glad she didn’t have to be here. Sometimes her reaction to Mom was more stressful than Mom herself.,51,"her, but now she could finally breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that I was no longer alone with him, and that his presence would somehow protect me from the darkness that lurked within his eyes, a darkness that seemed to be growing thicker and more menacing by the minute, as if it was a living, breathing entity that threatened to consume us all, and I couldn't help but wonder what had brought him to this place, what had driven him to seek refuge in our small, isolated community, and what secrets he might be hiding behind that stoic mask of his, secrets that could change everything, secrets that could destroy us all."
"“Thanks.” I looked back at the lake, at Maddy fading into",the distance on the pontoon. “And thanks for pushing her off.”,22,"the distance, the water's surface reflecting the vibrant hues of the setting sun, as if trying to hold onto the moment, and the memories we had shared together."
"Maddy had been right about his height. He was probably about six-one. He was on the leaner side, but",toned. I’d had to put sunblock on him and there was not a single part of that that I disliked.,39,"his broad shoulders and athletic build suggested a quiet strength that was not immediately apparent in his slender frame, and his piercing blue eyes seemed to hold a depth of character that was both captivating and slightly intimidating, as if he was a man who had seen his fair share of challenges and had emerged stronger because of them."
"“He’ll probably completely forget we even exist,” she mumbled, resting her head on","the cushion. “Amber has a way of making people do that,” she said tiredly.",27,"the worn wooden railing of the old porch, her eyes drifting out to the vast expanse of the ocean, where the fading light of day struggled to penetrate the thickening veil of night."
"Now I blew out a long breath. “Well, she’s funny. Hardworking. She reads any book she can get her hands on and she remembers everything she reads, even years later. She had me really","young. Same age Amber had you, actually. She’s a good mom, always shows up for us—school stuff, birthdays. She makes these Italian cookies every Christmas and Easter that make me think of my childhood.”",68,"laughing with her stories about the characters and their motivations, and she always knew how to make me feel better when I was down. But what really impressed me was her ability to balance her love of reading with her responsibilities, working multiple jobs to support her family and still finding time to volunteer at the local library. She was a true inspiration, and I often found myself wondering what made her tick, what drove her to be so dedicated and passionate about her life."
"When I got back to the cottage an hour later, Maddy was in the screened-in porch, reading. She","wore shorts and flip-flops, and she was drinking a beer. She set down her book when I came in.",37,"was engrossed in a worn paperback novel, her eyes scanning the pages with an intensity that suggested she was trying to escape the weight of her thoughts, and the warm sunlight streaming through the screens cast a golden glow on her face, illuminating the faint lines of concern etched on her forehead."
"“Yup. The things you cared about. The stuff you’d take in a fire,",or if Amber showed up to get you. You never once unpacked. Not really.”,27,"and the memories you'd save, the photographs, the letters, the heirlooms, the family recipes, the stories your grandmother used to tell, the smell of your mother's cooking, the sound of your father's laughter, the feel of your childhood home, the taste of your favorite childhood treats, the songs you used to sing, the games you used to play, the books you used to read, the places you used to visit, the people you used to know, the moments you used to cherish, the love you used to share, the laughter you used to enjoy, the tears you used to cry, the dreams you used to dream, the hopes you used to hold, the fears you used to face, the lessons you used to learn, the mistakes you used to make, the regrets you used to have, the promises you used to keep, the vows you used to make, the secrets you used to keep, the lies you used to tell, the truths you used to hide, the memories you used to forget, the moments you used to relive, the people you used to miss, the places you used to visit, the things you used to do, the things you used to be, the things you used to have, the things you used to know, the things you used to love, the things you used to hate, the things you used to fear, the things you used to desire, the things you used to want, the things you used to need, the things you used to lose, the things you used to find, the things you used to gain, the things you used to win, the things you used to lose, the things you used to regret, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used to recall, the things you used to remember, the things you used to forget, the things you used"
"I swear to God, I smell like rust,” Maddy whispered, sniffing her arm.",“Do I smell like rust? That water at the cottage is so gross.”,26,"and the metallic tang of decay that clung to her skin made her stomach turn, as if the very essence of the abandoned factory had seeped into her pores, a constant reminder of the dark secrets she had uncovered."
He grinned back and forth between us. “Maybe we can get together for dinner later this,"week, once you’ve gotten settled in,” he said. “Amber and I would love to have you.”",32,"week, I've got a new restaurant in mind that just opened up downtown, and I've been wanting to try it out, but I'm not sure if they're open for reservations yet, or if we should just wing it and see what happens, what do you guys think?"
It was never going to happen. I knew this. But Maddy wouldn’t let it go unless,"I tried—and really, I should try. Maddy was right, this whole situation was a ticking time bomb.",33,"she had some concrete evidence to back up her claims, and even then, I wasn't so sure, but she was determined to prove me wrong, and her persistence was starting to get under my skin, making me wonder if I had been too quick to dismiss the possibility, and what if she was right, what if it was all true, and I had been living in denial for so long."
"I paused, not sure how much I wanted to share. I decided on all of it. Emma was going to","be here when it all hit the fan anyway, so there was no point in keeping her in the dark.",40,"hear the whole story, every detail, every emotion, every thought that had been swirling in my mind since that fateful night, and I took a deep breath, preparing myself for the inevitable questions and reactions that would follow, wondering if she would still be able to look at me the same way after hearing the truth about my past, about the choices I had made, and the secrets I had kept hidden for so long."
"I studied the woman sitting next to me. Imagine someone who went through what she did, turning out the way she had. Able to give",grace to someone who’d let her down so badly. Emma was a better person than I was. And my life had been gentler than hers too.,51,"to smile and laugh with such warmth, to radiate a sense of peace and contentment, was a testament to the strength of her spirit, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always the possibility for healing and redemption, and that the scars of the past can be transformed into the beauty of the present, a true marvel of the human capacity to overcome adversity."
I might kiss her tonight. I almost did the other night at the,"dock, but then Amber showed up. I was looking forward to the do-over.",26,"was the charity gala, but I restrained myself, not wanting to ruin the evening for her, or for myself, as I wasn't sure how she felt, and the memory of that moment still lingered, a constant reminder of the unspoken tension between us."
I’d tried to be softer with her the last few days. The energy shift I’d had over Mom after my talk with Emma,"was almost as bad as being mad at her. At least when I was mad, I didn’t feel the guilt I was feeling now.",47,"was a welcome change, but it seemed to have little effect on her demeanor, which remained as prickly as ever, and I couldn't help but wonder if I'd only been fooling myself into thinking I'd made any progress at all, or if she was just biding her time, waiting for the old dynamic to resume its usual course, and I found myself feeling a mix of frustration and concern as I tried to navigate this new, uncharted territory with her."
"This was another thing I was trying not to think about—her leaving. I should be happy that she came at all, that she wasn’t in Hawaii. We still had three more dates, maybe more if I could convince her. I’d already gotten a freebie the other night at","Mom’s. But I dreaded the clock running out. Emma was the only good thing happening to me at the moment and when she was gone, not only would I lose her, I’d be left sitting in my new reality. Dad gone, Mom in prison. Me with all the children.",97,"the trendy new restaurant downtown, and I was determined to make the most of our time together. But the thought of her leaving again, of being apart from her for another long stretch, was a hard pill to swallow. I'd grown accustomed to having her by my side, to the way she smiled at me across the table, to the way her eyes sparkled when she laughed. The thought of losing that, even temporarily, was almost too much to bear. I pushed the thoughts aside and focused on the present, on the fact that she was here now, and I had three more chances to make a good impression. I took a deep breath and tried to shake off the anxiety that had been building in my chest, but it was hard to shake the feeling that time was running out, and I needed to make the most of it."
"“Yeah,” I said. “Thank you. There’s actually something else you can help me with too,” I","said, looking at them. “I need help making sure I can still see Emma until she goes.”",33,"do. I've been trying to track down a rare book, and I was wondering if you've seen it in your library or know anyone who might have a copy. It's an old novel, published in the late 19th century, and it's been out of print for decades. I've tried searching online, but I haven't been able to find any information about it, and I was hoping you might be able to help me dig up some leads. Do you think that's something you could help me with, or would you know someone who might be able to assist me?"
Emma pulled two Ziploc bags from her purse. They had Wheat Thins and celery in them. Probably her,"work snacks. “I trust this zipper seal with my life,” she said, turning to hand them to our passengers.",37,"snack was a leftover from her lunch at the office, but she wasn't entirely sure, as she had also stopped by the grocery store on her way home and might have picked up some fresh supplies, but the uncertainty only added to her curiosity as she opened the bags and peered inside, the crunchy sound of the crackers and the freshness of the celery filling the air with a sense of comfort and familiarity."
"I think I would have been embarrassed if I’d been on a date with anyone else. My mother, sobbing drunk the night before",she left for prison. But I knew Emma didn’t judge. That’s just not how she was. She judged this situation less than I did.,47,"had been yelling at me for not wearing the right shoes, and my father, trying to calm her down, had been telling her that I was going to be a great success, that I was going to make a fortune and move to the city, and my little brother, who was only eight at the time, had been looking up at me with this mixture of awe and fear in his eyes, as if I was some kind of superhero, and I was trying to live up to all of that, but now, with Alex, it was just me, and I felt like I was failing, like I was letting everyone down, and the thought of facing her, of facing all of that disappointment, was almost too much to bear."
"When she finished handing out Kleenex, Emma stayed turned in her seat.","“You know,” she said, “I worked for three months in a women’s prison.”",25,"and gazed out the window, her eyes drifting over the familiar landscape as she tried to process the emotional outburst that had just occurred."
It was funny that two pivotal moments in my life were happening at the exact same time and at complete odds with each,other. I didn’t know how to balance what was going on with my family and what was going on with my feelings for Emma.,47,"opposite ends of the spectrum, one a celebration of love and the other a shattering loss, yet both would forever be etched in my memory as defining chapters of my existence, a poignant reminder that life is a delicate balance of joy and sorrow, and that sometimes the most profound moments can be the ones that leave us breathless and bewildered."
"What did I have to offer her? I had nothing but baggage. Emotionally damaged, traumatized children that had been catapulted from one tragedy to the next, and me, barely keeping my head above water. Would I even have the time or the bandwidth to be any kind of partner while I was helping my",siblings navigate this situation? What was the point in even hoping for anything to be different between Emma and me? To what? Pull her from her glamorous jet-setting life to ground her with me in this fucking mess? I’d feel like apologizing every day. There was no way I could ever be worth it.,108,"children navigate their own grief and learn to heal, all while trying to rebuild a sense of normalcy in a world that had been turned upside down by the loss of their mother. I thought about all the times I'd failed them, all the times I'd let them down, and wondered if I was truly equipped to be the rock they so desperately needed. The weight of responsibility was crushing me, and I couldn't help but wonder if I was doing more harm than good by even trying. But as I looked at them, at their small, fragile faces, I knew I had to keep going, no matter how impossible it seemed. I had to find a way to be strong for them, to be the parent they deserved, even if it killed me. And so, with a newfound determination, I took a deep breath and began the long, arduous journey of healing and recovery, one step at a time."
Sarah gave him a look. “Maybe for you. Hanging out with my brother,isn’t my idea of a good time. I’ll be outside. I want to go.”,27,"is a big responsibility, but I'm not sure I'm ready for that kind of commitment, especially when it comes to someone as reckless as Alex."
"“Emma, go meet him at the door, or I will lose my shit. I didn’t push a clunky car stroller around the universe’s largest mall for five hours so you could shake hands","with this guy on the way out. As soon as he shows up, I’m going to park around the front at the lobby to give you some privacy. Go get your damn forehead kiss.”",67,"with some stranger who's probably just going to stand there and make awkward small talk while I'm still trying to get the stroller folded up and the diaper bag zipped. You're the one who's been begging to meet your great-aunt, so you'd better be ready to put on a smile and be polite, even if she does smell like last week's laundry and has a haircut that looks like she stuck her finger in a socket. Now go, before I lose my mind completely."""
“So he would come home and see you there. Or because she was bored,"and lonely. FYI, Amber only ever calls you when it serves Amber,” she said.",28,"and had nothing better to do, she would go to his house, and he would be drawn to her presence, which was a source of both comfort and distraction for him, a respite from the monotony of his daily routine."
"I always thought it was a proximity thing. She traveled a lot, she changed jobs all the time, she was busy, she","was dealing with whatever Amber dealt with. But now I couldn’t rationalize why nothing was different, even though she was right here.",44,"had a lot on her plate, and I guess I just assumed that's why she didn't have time for me, but now I'm not so sure, maybe it was something more, maybe she was just trying to protect me from the truth, or maybe she was protecting herself, from the pain of losing me, or maybe it was something entirely different, something I'll never know, something that will haunt me for the rest of my life."
He nodded over his shoulder. “I should probably let you get back to work. I have to go pick,"up Alex and take him to a doctor’s appointment.” He paused. “Am I allowed to hug you goodbye, or…?”",38,"up my sister from the airport, she's arriving late from a business trip. I'll see you around, maybe at the staff meeting tomorrow. Have a good day, and don't let the paperwork pile up on your desk."
"“The whole house has it. I probably have it,” I added. “Sarah’s having a",panic attack. I have to go help. I can’t leave them there infested with bugs.”,29,"child is not the only reason I've been feeling so anxious and on edge lately, but it's definitely a contributing factor, and I've been trying to prepare myself for the challenges that come with being a new parent, but it's not just the baby's arrival that's got me worried, it's also the fact that my relationship with Sarah has been feeling a bit strained lately, and I'm not sure if we're on the same page when it comes to our future together, and I'm trying to navigate these feelings and figure out what's best for both of us and our unborn child, but it's hard to know where to start or who to turn to for advice, and I feel like I'm just winging it and hoping for the best, but I know I need to be more proactive and take control of my life and my relationship, and I'm hoping that having this baby will bring us closer together and help us work through our issues, but I'm also scared of the unknown and the potential consequences of our decisions, and I'm trying to stay positive and focus on the excitement and joy of becoming a parent, but it's hard to shake off the doubts and fears that are creeping in, and I'm not sure if I'm ready for this new chapter in my life, but I know I have to be strong for Sarah and our baby, and I'm trying to find the courage to face whatever comes next."
I took her hand and did my best to make my face straight. People were already stopping to watch. I made,"my voice low so only she could hear it. “Emma, would you do me the honor of delousing my family with me?”",43,"glance at us, their faces a mixture of curiosity and suspicion, and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as I tried to think of something, anything, to say to break the awkward silence that had fallen over us."
"“She’ll be home one day, Sarah. It’ll come faster than you think. You can visit her and write to her and call her.","You can stay close to her—you just have to try. I know this is hard, but good things can still come out of it.”",47,"and I'll make sure to send you all the letters she writes, so you can stay connected to her, even when she's far away, and I'll be here to support you both, through every step of this journey, no matter how long it takes."
Sarah was practically bouncing. “I can’t believe he said yes. Mom never,lets me do anything. She won’t even let me get my ears pierced.”,25,"thought she'd ever let me go to the concert, but I guess she finally realized how much it means to me."
"In that moment, maybe for the first time ever for me, she looked like a little",girl. She was a little girl.
