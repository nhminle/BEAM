"“Butch and I were kids going to a one-room schoolhouse before the Second World War. We grew up in a no-stoplight dirt-road town fixing cars, patching them up, playing sports and then coaching them. As men we took part in town politics and maintained the town dump—very similar jobs, now that I think about it. We hunted, we fished, we put out grassfires in the summer and plowed the town roads in the winter. Knocked over a right smart of mailboxes doing it, too. I knew","him when no one knew his name—or mine—outside of a twenty-mile radius. I should have come to see him these last years, but I was busy with my own affairs. I thought to myself, there’s time. We always think that, I guess. Then time runs out. Butch was a fine artist, but he was also a good man. I think that’s more important. Maybe some here don’t and that’s all right, that’s all right. Thing is, I always had his back and he always had mine.”","that Butch's dad was the town's postmaster, and I'd often help him sort the mail, which was a big responsibility for a young fella like me.

Butch and I were inseparable, and we'd often sneak off into the nearby woods to explore and get into all sorts of trouble. We'd climb trees, play pranks on the other kids, and just enjoy the freedom of being young. As we got older, we started to take on more responsibilities, helping our parents with the farm work and learning the ins and outs of running a small business. Butch's dad was a hard worker, and he taught us the value of hard work and dedication. I think that's where I got my work ethic from, and it's served me well over the years. We'd often sit on the porch, watching the sunset and talking about our dreams and aspirations. Butch wanted to be a doctor, and I wanted to be a mechanic, and we'd spend hours discussing the pros and cons of each career path. Those were good times, and I'm grateful to have had such a close friend by my side. Even now, when I look back on those days, I'm filled with a sense of nostalgia and wonder at how far we've come. We may not have had much, but we had each other, and that's all that truly mattered."

"So that was what I did, although something about the way Pop looked just then stuck with me. It was the look of a man who could say quite","a lot on the subject of how he and his friend Butch had achieved fame and fortune… but who chose not to. Who chose, in fact, to keep it close.","not a word, but whose eyes told a different story altogether, a story of a deep-seated pain and a sense of resignation that seemed to weigh heavily",59,"not a word, but whose eyes told a different story altogether, a story of a deep-seated pain and a sense of resignation that seemed to weigh heavily on his shoulders, a look that I couldn't quite put my finger on, but one that left an indelible mark on my memory, and it wasn't until much later, when I was going over the events of that day in my mind, that I began to piece together the fragments of a narrative that would change my understanding of Pop and our relationship forever."

"I read a review of Pop’s first book, The Lightning Storm, and the reviewer said this: “Not much happens in the","first hundred or so pages of Mr. Carmody’s suspenseful yarn, but the reader is drawn on anyway, because there are violins.”","completion, but the author's masterful use of language and vivid descriptions of the characters' inner turmoil more than make",42,"completion, but the author's masterful use of language and vivid descriptions of the characters' inner turmoil more than make up for the lack of external plot events, leaving the reader with a haunting sense of unease that lingers long after the final page has been turned, a testament to the power of subtlety and restraint in storytelling."
"I knew a lot of this. I learned more from Ruth Crawford herself at the Korner Koffee Kup, across the street from the Gateway Motel and just about a block down from the post office. That’s where Pop got his mail,","and there was usually a pretty damn good budget of it. I always stopped at the Koffee Kup after grabbing the post.

"It was Ruth Crawford, looking slim and trim in white slacks, a pink shell top, and a matching mask—that was the second year","of Covid.

"“Not bad. As you must know, since you’re staying right across the street.","The muffins are better. But still no interview. Sorry, Ms. Crawford, can’t do it.”","from the large window of your apartment, you can see the entire façade of our house,",27,"from the large window of your apartment, you can see the entire façade of our house, and I'm sure you've noticed the commotion that's been going on lately."

But the dorm mom seemed genuinely concerned and apologetic, and I decided to take her seriously, so I quickly packed my belongings and waited anxiously for my parents to arrive. When they finally showed up, they explained that they had received a letter from the university administration informing them that I had been involved in a serious incident, and that they had decided to withdraw me from the university immediately. I was devastated, as I had been working hard to maintain good grades and was on track to graduate, and I had no idea what the incident was or what I had done wrong. My parents were tight-lipped about the details, but they told me that I would have to return home and sort things out with them before we could discuss the matter further.

"“Hunting in the 30-Mile,” he said promptly. “We went the second week of November from the time we were teenagers right up until Butch mounted his steel pony and set sail for the golden west. We stayed at a little cabin in the woods that my grandfather built. Butch claimed that his grandfather pitched in when it came to the roofing, which might or might not have been true. It","was a quarter-mile or so beyond Jilasi Creek.

Butch started across.

"It’s a bad dream. Danny’s had a few before, everyone has a nightmare from time to time, but this is the worst one ever. Nothing bad is happening","at first, but that doesn’t help; the sense of impending doom is so strong it’s an actual taste in his mouth, like sucking on a clump of pennies.","but the sense of impending doom that clings to him like a shroud, the feeling that something is watching him from just out of sight, is making it",56,"but the sense of impending doom that clings to him like a shroud, the feeling that something is watching him from just out of sight, is making it impossible for him to shake off the feeling of unease that has settled in the pit of his stomach, and he can't help but wonder if this is more than just a dream, if it's a warning, a premonition of something that's yet to come, a harbinger of darkness that's lurking just beyond the edge of his perception, waiting to pounce."
He’s walking along the shoulder of a dirt road that’s been packed and oiled to keep the dust down. It’s night. A quarter moon has just risen. To Danny it looks like a sideways grin. Or a sneer. He passes a sign reading,"COUNTY ROAD F, only the O and the Y have been spraypainted over, and UCK has been crammed in to the right of the F, so the sign now reads CUNT ROAD FUCK.

""Welcome to Willow Creek, Population 2,500"" and he can't help but wonder if the number is accurate, considering the darkness that seems to swallow the town whole. The only sound is the crunch of gravel beneath his boots and the distant hum of a crickets' chorus. He quickens his pace, his eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of life, but the only movement comes from the occasional firefly dancing in the darkness. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and Danny can't shake the feeling that he's being watched. He glances over his shoulder, but the road behind him is empty, the only sound the soft rustle of the wind through the trees. He continues on, his heart beating slightly faster, as the trees grow taller and the darkness seems to press in around him."
"There’s corn on both sides of the road, not as high as an elephant’s eye but maybe four feet, suggesting it’s early summer.

Danny felt a shiver run down his spine as he gazed up at the building, his mind racing with all the terrible possibilities that it might hold. He quickened his pace, his eyes fixed on the road ahead, eager to put as much distance between himself and the ominous structure as possible. The cornfields seemed to stretch on forever, a sea of green that seemed to swallow up the horizon, and Danny felt a sense of unease wash over him as he realized just how isolated he was.

A faded tarp, torn and frayed, hangs limply from the side of the bed, flapping lazily in the gentle breeze. The air is thick with the acrid smell of gasoline and the distant hum of a fly buzzes annoyingly around the driver's ear, a constant reminder of the sweltering heat that seems to cling to every surface like a damp shroud."

The student and faculty parking lots of Wilder High are almost completely empty because school let out some weeks earlier.

As he walked towards the entrance of the school, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was being watched, and the hairs on the back of his neck stood on end.

It's a time of renewal, a time of growth, and a time when the very fabric of the school seems to come alive. The students' laughter echoes down the corridors, mingling with the sound of chalk scratching on blackboards and the murmur of hushed conversations in the library. As the weeks go by, the campus transforms into a vibrant tapestry of activity, each thread woven together by the collective efforts of the students, teachers, and staff. The sense of community is palpable, a feeling that is hard to find in the midst of the chaos that often accompanies the start of a new semester. But for now, all is right with the world, and the school is a place of wonder and discovery, where minds are expanded and futures are forged."

The sunlight streaming through the windows cast an eerie glow on the room, making him feel like he was trapped in a world that was not his own, and the silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the occasional chirping of birds outside, which seemed to mock him with their carefree songs, a stark contrast to the turmoil brewing inside him, as he struggled to recall the details of the dream, and the identity of the mysterious woman who had haunted his slumber."
