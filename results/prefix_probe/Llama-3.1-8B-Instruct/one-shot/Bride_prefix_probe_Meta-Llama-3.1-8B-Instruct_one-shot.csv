"Not quite the stuff of childhood dreams. Then again, I’m no dreamer. I only ever contemplated marriage once, back in the gloomy days of my childhood.

But as I grew older, I began to realize that perhaps my initial perception was skewed, and that marriage could be a beautiful, yet imperfect union between two people who had found a deep connection. Little did I know, my own life was about to take an unexpected turn, one that would lead me down a path I never could have imagined, and force me to confront the very idea of love and commitment in ways I never thought possible."
"That was fourteen years ago, though, and Serena never married me. In fact, she’s long gone.

I did try to arrange a meeting. Suggested to my people that they suggest to his people that we could grab lunch the week before the ceremony. Coffee the previous day.

"The first things I notice are the two walls of windows, which is exactly what Father wants. Every Human I’ve talked with assumes that Vampyres hate light and relish darkness, but they couldn’t be more wrong. The sun may be forbidden to us, toxic always and deathly in large quantities, but that’s precisely why","we covet it with such intensity. Windows are a luxury, because they need to be treated with absurdly expensive materials that filter everything that might harm us.

The way the light dances across the room, casting intricate shadows on the walls, is almost mesmerizing. It's as if the very essence of the sun's rays has been distilled into a soothing balm for our sensitive skin. Father's design is a masterclass in subtlety, allowing us to bask in the beauty of the sun's presence without succumbing to its destructive power. The result is a space that feels both serene and vibrant, a sanctuary that nurtures our kind while also acknowledging the world beyond our walls. As I gaze out the windows, I feel a sense of connection to the world outside, a world that is both familiar and yet, utterly alien to us. The trees sway gently in the breeze, their leaves rustling softly, and I am reminded of the countless nights I've spent walking among them, feeling the wind in my hair and the sun's warmth on my skin. It's a memory I thought I'd long forgotten, but it's as if the windows have awakened a part of me that I thought was lost forever. I feel a pang of longing, a sense of nostalgia for a time when I was still human, when the sun's touch was a simple pleasure, not a potentially deadly poison. But as I turn back to the room, I'm struck by the beauty of our little sanctuary, and the love and care that Father has put into creating it. It's a testament to his devotion to our kind, and a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope and always beauty to be found."
"“Whose? Yours? Are you going to . . .” I don’t bother finishing the sentence—the sheer thought is ludicrous. It’s not just weddings that have gone out of fashion hundreds of years ago, but the entire idea","of long-term relationships. As it turns out, when your species sucks at producing children, encouraging sexual walkabouts and the search for reproductively compatible partners takes precedence over romance. I doubt Vampyres were ever particularly romantic, anyway. “Whose?”","of romantic love as a grand, sweeping gesture, a notion that has been reduced to a quaint relic of a bygone era, a relic that only exists in dusty old novels and overwrought ballads, where chivalry and true love are the stuff of fairy tales, and the harsh realities of life",74,"of romantic love as a grand, sweeping gesture, a notion that has been reduced to a quaint relic of a bygone era, a relic that only exists in dusty old novels and overwrought ballads, where chivalry and true love are the stuff of fairy tales, and the harsh realities of life have long since taken their toll, leaving behind a world where love is a mere afterthought, a fleeting infatuation, a momentary distraction from the monotony of daily life, a world where the idea of a grand, sweeping gesture is nothing more than a distant memory, a relic of a time when people still believed in the power of true love, a time when the world was a more innocent, more romantic place, a time that seems to belong to another era, another world, a world that is now nothing more than a distant recollection, a bittersweet reminder of what has been lost, a reminder that the world has moved on, and with it, the idea of true love has been relegated to the dustbin of history, a relic of a bygone age, a time when people still believed in the magic of love, a time that seems to be nothing more than a distant memory, a memory that is slowly fading away, like the dying embers of a once-roaring fire, leaving behind only a faint glow, a faint reminder of what once was, a reminder that the world has changed, and with it, the idea of true love has been forever lost."

But I'm not sure I know how to do that anymore, or if I even want to."
"No shit. “And I don’t know you enough to make a judgment. Your jeans are cool,","though.” Riveting conversation, but I’m about to pass out. Thankfully, with one last withering look, Juno leaves.","but that's not enough to convince me that you're not just some poser trying to fit in with the crowd, or that you're",33,"but that's not enough to convince me that you're not just some poser trying to fit in with the crowd, or that you're not just a wannabe trying to impress me with your fashion sense, or that you're not just a total stranger who stumbled upon this conversation by accident, but I suppose it's a good starting point, and I'm willing to get to know you better, but don't expect me to make any judgments about you based solely on your wardrobe choices, let's see if there's more to you than just your style, and maybe, just maybe, we can have a real conversation about something more meaningful than just your clothes."
"The corner of my eye catches a hint of movement. I turn, half expecting Ana to make","a comeback, but it’s just Serena’s goddamned fucking cat, stretching his way out from under the bed.","be a wisecrack or a sarcastic remark, but instead, I see her standing by the window, her eyes fixed intently",34,"be a wisecrack or a sarcastic remark, but instead, I see her standing by the window, her eyes fixed intently on something outside, her expression a mixture of concern and curiosity, and for a moment, I wonder if she's seen something that I haven't, something that's been hidden from me, something that could change everything."
"Growing up collecting attempted murders like milk teeth tempered me and taught me to be calm under pressure. And yet I still remember it, that first churning twist in my stomach when Serena didn’t","turn up to my place for laundry night. Didn’t reply to my texts. Didn’t pick up the phone.

It felt a lot like fear.","answer the phone, her voice on the other end of the line a hesitant whisper that sent a shiver down my spine, the sound of her words barely audible over the hum of the refrigerator",69,"answer the phone, her voice on the other end of the line a hesitant whisper that sent a shiver down my spine, the sound of her words barely audible over the hum of the refrigerator in the background, and I knew in that instant that something was terribly wrong, that the calm façade I had built around myself was about to be shattered, and I was left standing there, frozen in a mixture of fear and anticipation, wondering what had happened, and why she was calling me in the dead of night, her words spilling out in a rush, a jumbled mess of tears and apologies, and I listened, my heart pounding in my chest, as she told me the unthinkable, that she had been in an accident, that she was okay, but the car was totaled, and I felt my world spinning, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios, and I knew I had to get to her, to be there for her, to hold her, to tell her that everything was going to be alright, but as I stood there, my feet rooted to the spot, I felt a familiar sensation creeping in, a creeping sense of dread, a feeling that I had been here before, that I had faced this same fear, this same uncertainty, and I knew that I had to push it back, to let go of the past, to face the present, to be there for Serena, to be strong for her, and for myself."
"“A few days? She still wouldn’t let the little asshole starve,” I hurried to add, but the officer had already dropped his pen. And even though I went back to the station three times that week, and eventually managed to get a missing person report filed, no one did anything","to find Serena. The hazard, I guess, of being alone in the world: no one to care that she was safe, and healthy, and alive. No one but me, and I didn’t count. I shouldn’t have been surprised, and I wasn’t. But apparently I still had the capacity to feel hurt.","about it, and it wasn't until I showed up at the precinct the fourth time, visibly shaken and with a photo of the child in my hand, that they finally took me seriously.

He nodded curtly and picked up the phone, dialing a number with a look of determination on his face. I watched as he waited for someone to answer, his expression growing more intense by the second, and I could sense that something was finally going to be done about the little girl's disappearance."
"Because no one cared whether I was safe, or healthy, or alive. No one but Serena. The sister of my heart,","if not of my blood. And even though I’d been plenty alone, I’d never felt so lonely as after she was gone.","who had been my rock, my confidante, and my guiding light in the darkest of times, stood by me through every",43,"who had been my rock, my confidante, and my guiding light in the darkest of times, stood by me through every storm, and her unwavering love and support gave me the strength to carry on, even when the world around me seemed determined to tear me apart."
"I had the keys, after all. Because the key to everything is but a line of code. I was able to rifle through her bank statements, IP addresses, cell phone locations. Herald emails, metadata, app usage. Serena was a journalist, one who","wrote about delicate financial stuff, and the most likely option was that she’d gotten embroiled in something fishy while working on a story, but I wasn’t going to exclude other possibilities. So I went through everything, and found . . . nothing.","kept meticulous records of her sources, contacts, and leads, which made her digital footprint a treasure trove for someone like me, a skilled hacker with a personal vendetta.

I dug deeper, uncovering a web of connections that went far beyond a simple news story, revealing a complex network of powerful individuals and organizations that seemed to be hiding in plain sight. The more I dug, the more I realized that Serena's investigation had been getting close to something big, something that could bring down empires and shake the very foundations of our society. I knew I had to be careful, as I was now walking a thin line between curiosity and obsession, but I couldn't help myself, I had to know more, and so I continued to dig, following the digital breadcrumbs that led me further and further down the rabbit hole, into a world of corruption, deceit, and conspiracy."
"And that’s when I did it: I kneeled in front of Serena’s damn fucking cat. He was playing like he always did after dinner, pawing at a crumpled receipt in a corner of the living room, but managed to squeeze a couple of hisses into his busy schedule just for me. “Listen.” I swallowed. Rubbed my","hand on my chest and then even slapped it, trying to dull the ache. “I know you only knew her for a few days, but I really, really . . .” I scrunched my eyes shut. Oh fuck, this was hard. “I don’t know how it happened, but I think that Serena might be . . .”","palms together, trying to calm down the racing of my heart, and took a deep breath.

The air was thick with the scent of old books and stale air, and for a moment, I forgot about the reason I was there. But then I looked up at Serena, her piercing green eyes fixed on me, and I remembered. I remembered the way she had been acting all day, the way she had been avoiding me, and the way she had been whispering to her cat. I remembered the way the cat had been staring at me, its eyes seeming to bore into my very soul. And I knew I had to know the truth. I had to know what was going on, and I had to know now. So I took another deep breath, and I asked the question that had been burning in my mind all day: ""Serena, what's going on?"" The cat, sensing my tension, let out a low growl, and Serena's eyes flicked to it before returning to me. For a moment, we just stared at each other, the only sound the soft hum of the air conditioner in the background. And then, in a voice that was barely above a whisper, she spoke the words that would change everything."
"The receipt, which wasn’t a balled-up receipt at all. It was a piece of paper","torn from a journal, or perhaps a notebook, or—no. A planner. Serena’s incredibly outdated planner.","was carefully folded and tucked away in the back of a dusty old wallet, its edges worn and frayed from",30,"was carefully folded and tucked away in the back of a dusty old wallet, its edges worn and frayed from years of being carried around, and it seemed to hold a secret that only the wallet's owner knew."
"Or maybe not quite. A distant bell rang, reminding me of a game Serena and I used to play as kids, a primitive substitution cipher we made up to gossip freely in front of our caregivers. We’d named it the butterfly alphabet, and","it mostly consisted of adding b- and f- syllables to normal words. Nothing complicated: even rusty as I was, it took my brain only a few seconds to untangle it. And once I was done, I had something. I had three whole words:","it involved replacing each letter with a corresponding letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet, a simple yet effective way to conceal our secrets from prying ears.

"I didn’t scream, or cry, or attack that old hag. I was paralyzed, unable to function properly for the rest of the night, and only started processing what had happened when I","got home and told Serena, who was furious on my behalf and demanded a promise from the caregiver on shift: that I would never be forced to attend a similar function again.","was still standing in the dimly lit alley, the only sound being the distant hum of the city and the faint rustling of the wind through the trash cans, as I tried to make sense",64,"was still standing in the dimly lit alley, the only sound being the distant hum of the city and the faint rustling of the wind through the trash cans, as I tried to make sense of the events that had transpired, my mind racing with questions and my heart heavy with a mix of fear and confusion, wondering if I had just imagined the whole thing, or if the old woman's words had been a twisted reality, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was being watched, that unblinking gaze still seared into my memory, as I slowly began to make my way back to the safety of my apartment, my legs trembling beneath me, and my hands shaking as I fumbled for my keys, the darkness of the night seeming to close in around me like a shroud, and I couldn't help but wonder if I would ever be able to sleep again, or if the memory of that encounter would haunt me forever."

"There might be something stunted about me. After the Collateral term was over, Serena and I were free to venture into the outside world, to be with people who weren’t our tutors or our caregivers, to fall in love and make friends. Serena jumped right into that, but I could","never bring myself to. Partly because the closer I’d let someone get to me, the harder it’d be to hide who I was. Or maybe spending the first eighteen years of my life becoming acquainted with the cruelty of all species didn’t quite set me up for a bright future.","not help but feel a little apprehensive, as if the world outside our sheltered bubble was a vast and unpredictable sea, and I was a small boat with no anchor to hold onto.

I had always been content with the routine of our daily lessons and activities, and the thought of navigating the complexities of social interactions and relationships was daunting. Serena, on the other hand, seemed to thrive in this new environment, effortlessly making friends and charming everyone she met, while I struggled to find my footing. I began to wonder if there was something fundamentally different about me, something that made it harder for me to connect with others, or if it was just a matter of being shy and needing time to adjust. As I watched Serena laugh and smile with our new friends, I couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy, wondering why I couldn't be more like her, more carefree and confident. But deep down, I knew that I was different, and that my uniqueness was what made me, me."
"“But then you’d get mad because Father and I weren’t paying attention to you, and wander off on your own, grumbling about",the oddest things. Let me know if that changes.

The smell of sizzling meat and the sound of laughter carried on the wind were familiar comforts, but they also served as a reminder of the differences between our worlds. As I watched the Humans mingling and chatting, I couldn't help but wonder if they ever felt the same sense of disconnection that I did, like they were outsiders looking in on a world that wasn't quite their own. The sun was setting, casting a warm orange glow over the gathering, and I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized that I was starting to feel a connection to these Humans, a connection that went beyond mere curiosity or fascination. It was a feeling I couldn't quite explain, but it was there, simmering just beneath the surface, waiting to be explored."

He's a man with a story to tell, one that's etched on his face, and I'm curious to know what it is. As I approach him, I notice the way the sunlight filters through the trees, casting dappled shadows on the ground, and the way the sea breeze carries the scent of salt and seaweed. It's a moment of serenity, one that's hard to find in a world that's always in a hurry. I clear my throat to announce my presence, and he turns to face me, his eyes locking onto mine with a hint of surprise and wariness, as if he's not sure if he wants to be disturbed from his reverie."
