"Not quite the stuff of childhood dreams. Then again, I’m no dreamer. I only ever contemplated marriage once, back in the gloomy days of my childhood. Following a few too-harsh punishments and a","poorly executed assassination attempt, Serena and I concocted plans for a grand escape, which was going to involve pyrotechnics-based diversions, stealing our math tutor’s car, and flipping off our caregivers in the rearview mirror.",67,"many sleepless nights, I had convinced myself that marriage was a far-off, unattainable fantasy, a notion reserved for those with more optimism and less reality to contend with. But life has a way of surprising us, and as I stood there, gazing out at the vast expanse of the ocean, I couldn't help but wonder if perhaps I had been too hasty in my judgment. The sea air carried the whispers of a long-forgotten melody, one that stirred something deep within me, a sense of longing and possibility that I thought I had left behind. It was then that I saw her, a woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, walking towards me with a gentle smile, and for the first time in years, I felt the spark of hope that maybe, just maybe, my childhood dreams weren't as impossible as I had thought."
"That was fourteen years ago, though, and Serena never married me. In fact, she’s long gone. I’m here alone, with a giant heap of","expensive wedding favors that’ll hopefully fool guests into overlooking the lack of love, genetic compatibility, or even previous acquaintance between me and the groom.",48,"of dusty memories, the creaky old house a constant reminder of what could have been, the silence a heavy blanket that suffocates me every day, and the only sound the wind whispering through the empty halls, a melancholic echo of the life I never had with her."
I did try to arrange a meeting. Suggested to my people that they suggest to his people that we could grab lunch the week before the ceremony. Coffee the previous day. A glass of tap water the morning of—anything to avoid a “How do you do?” in front of the officiant. My request,"was escalated to the Vampyre council, and resulted in a phone call from one of the members’ aides. His tone managed to be polite while heavily implying that I was a cuckoo nutbird. “He’s a Were. A very powerful and dangerous Were. Just the logistics of providing security for such a meeting would be—”",107,"was met with a mixture of confusion and amusement, as if I had proposed a clandestine affair rather than a casual get-together. My people, bless their well-meaning hearts, seemed to think that I was being overly cautious, that the tension between us was merely a minor obstacle to be navigated. But I knew better. I had seen the way he looked at me, the way his eyes lingered on mine, and I knew that this was more than just a simple case of pre-wedding jitters. And so, I persisted, trying to find a way to break the ice, to ease the palpable awkwardness that hung between us like a challenge. But the more I tried, the more it seemed to grow, until it felt like an insurmountable wall, one that threatened to derail the entire proceedings."
"One of the agents stops us in front of the double doors that lead into the courtyard. “Councilman Lark, Miss Lark, one minute. They’re not quite ready for you.” We","wait side by side for a handful of uncomfortable moments, then Father turns to me. In my stylist-mandated heels, I nearly reach his height, and his eyes easily catch mine.",60,"are ushered into a small waiting room with a single chair and a small table, the walls adorned with faded portraits of former council members, their stern faces a testament to the gravity of the proceedings that lie ahead, the air thick with anticipation and a hint of unease, as we stand there, our footsteps echoing off the cold stone floor, the only sound in the oppressive silence, until finally, a soft voice calls out from the other side of the door, ""Councilman Lark, Miss Lark, please enter."" The doors creak open, and we step into a grand, high-ceilinged chamber, the room filled with a sea of expectant faces, all eyes fixed on us, their expressions a mix of curiosity and suspicion, as we make our way to the front of the room, where a lone figure sits at the head of a long, polished table, its surface adorned with a single, leather-bound book, the cover embossed with a symbol that seems to gleam in the dim light, and as we approach, the figure looks up, its eyes narrowing slightly, as it regards us with a calculating gaze, its expression unreadable, and for a moment, we stand there, frozen in uncertainty, unsure of what lies ahead, or what the outcome will be."
"“But they found a replacement,” Cal adds, sliding a manila folder on the",counter. “Everything’s in here. They want to know if she has your approval.”,26,"of worn, beige-colored paper across the cluttered desk, the contents spilling out in a jumbled mess of receipts and handwritten notes."
"The first things I notice are the two walls of windows, which is exactly what Father wants. Every Human I’ve talked with assumes that Vampyres hate light and relish darkness, but they couldn’t be more wrong. The sun may be forbidden to us, toxic always and deathly in large quantities, but that’s precisely why","we covet it with such intensity. Windows are a luxury, because they need to be treated with absurdly expensive materials that filter everything that might harm us. And windows this large are the most bombastic of status symbols, in a full display of dynastic power and obscene wealth. And beyond them . . .",108,"we have a unique affinity for the gentle warmth and soft glow it provides, especially in the filtered form that streams through these windows. The way the light dances across the room, casting intricate shadows on the walls, is almost mesmerizing. It's as if the very essence of the sun's rays has been distilled into a soothing balm for our sensitive skin. Father's design is a masterclass in subtlety, allowing us to bask in the beauty of the sun's presence without succumbing to its destructive power. The windows are not just a necessity, but a work of art, a testament to the ingenuity of our kind. And yet, as I gaze out at the world beyond our sanctuary, I am reminded that our love of light is not without its costs. The humans who live in the surrounding buildings seem oblivious to our presence, but I know that their perception of us is far from accurate. They see us as creatures of the night, monsters that lurk in the shadows, preying on the innocent. But the truth is far more complex, and it's a truth that I'm not sure I'm ready to confront."
"“Whose? Yours? Are you going to . . .” I don’t bother finishing the sentence—the sheer thought is ludicrous. It’s not just weddings that have gone out of fashion hundreds of years ago, but the entire idea","of long-term relationships. As it turns out, when your species sucks at producing children, encouraging sexual walkabouts and the search for reproductively compatible partners takes precedence over romance. I doubt Vampyres were ever particularly romantic, anyway. “Whose?”",74,"of romantic love as a grand, sweeping gesture, a notion that has been reduced to a quaint relic of a bygone era, a relic that only exists in dusty old novels and overwrought ballads. And yet, as I stand here, looking at you with a mix of confusion and curiosity, I am struck by the way the sunlight catches the curve of your cheek, the way your eyes sparkle with amusement, and for a moment, I am transported back to a time when such gestures were not only possible but expected. It's a fleeting feeling, one that I quickly push aside as absurd, but it's enough to make me wonder: what if? What if this isn't just a silly, outdated notion, but a lingering echo of something deeper, something that still resonates within us, waiting to be rediscovered?"
“And your take on her . . . ?” He must have one. Father’s collaboration,with Governor Davenport is the driving force behind the amicable relationship between our two people.,30,"with the detective was a subject of much speculation, and he had undoubtedly formed some opinion, though he chose not to share it with his son, at least not yet, as he leaned back in his chair, his eyes fixed on the floor, his expression a mask of neutrality."
"“However, I am still tasked with guaranteeing the safety of my people. And once Governor Davenport is gone, in addition to","the Were threat that we constantly face at the southern border, there might be one at the north. From the Humans.”",42,"to the chaos that will undoubtedly ensue, I fear that the fragile balance of power in our colony will be irreparably shattered, leaving us vulnerable to the whims of the ruthless and cunning Governor's loyalists, who will stop at nothing to maintain their grip on our fair city, and it is my duty to prevent such a catastrophe from unfolding, no matter the personal cost to myself."
"“You hold a Human child as a deterrent for ten years, with the mutual understanding that if the Humans","violate the terms of our alliance, the Vampyres will instantly murder the child. That seems crude and simplistic, too.”",38,"it is discovered that you have been harboring a Human, you will be forced to surrender it to the Galactic Union for study and possible assimilation into their ranks, a fate worse than death for any sentient being, and one that has kept countless species in a state of constant fear and subjugation for centuries, a delicate balance that has been maintained through a complex web of threats and promises, with the Humans themselves being the unwitting pawns in this grand game of intergalactic politics."
"He nods. “A little more than a week ago, her little brother, Abel, turned fifteen. That night, he and three friends were out partying, and found themselves near the river. Emboldened","by their youth and feeble-mindedness, they challenged each other to swim across it, touch the riverbank that belongs to Were territory, and then swim back. A show of bravery, if you will.”",63,"by the darkness and the music, they decided to take a walk along the riverbank, where they stumbled upon an old, abandoned boat. The group, fueled by curiosity and a sense of adventure, decided to explore the vessel, and it was then that they discovered a small, hidden compartment deep within its hull. Inside, they found a mysterious journal belonging to a person named Elijah, who wrote about a long-forgotten tragedy that had occurred in their town many years ago. The journal's contents sparked their imagination, and they began to speculate about the events that had led to the tragedy, and the possible connection to their own lives. As they delved deeper into the journal, they started to uncover secrets that had been hidden for decades, and their lives would never be the same again."
“Their succession of power is not particularly sophisticated. Weres are most,"closely related to dogs, after all. Suffice to say, Roscoe is dead.”",23,"often seen as a brutal and primal force, driven by their baser instincts and a"
"“He is young, you see. Around your age and built of a different stock. As savage as Roscoe, perhaps, but",more open-minded. He believes that peace in the region is possible. That alliances among all three species should be cultivated.”,40,"with a more refined edge to his features, and an air of quiet confidence that is hard to ignore. His eyes, a piercing blue, seem to hold a world of intensity, as if he is constantly weighing the pros and cons of every situation, and his sharp jawline speaks to a determination that is both admirable and intimidating. Despite his rugged appearance, there is an undeniable sense of vulnerability about him, a sense that he is still learning to navigate the complexities of the world around him, and that he is not afraid to ask for help when he needs it."
"“The other children knew that I’d be the one sent to the Humans, and they started calling me fangless traitor as soon as they could form full sentences. Or have you forgotten when I was seven, and the sons and daughters of your fellow councilmen stole my clothes and pushed me out in the sun right before midday? And those same people spat on me and mocked me when","I returned from ten years serving as their Collateral, so I’m not—” I exhale slowly, and remind myself that this is fine. I am fine. Untouchable. I’m twenty-five and I have my fake Human IDs, my apartment, my cat (fuck you, Serena), my . . . Okay, I probably don’t have a job right now, but I’ll find another soon, with 100 percent fewer Pierces. I have friends—a friend. Probably.",139,"my mother, the pack's alpha, stood by and did nothing, her eyes cast downward, her voice barely above a whisper as she told me that I was a disappointment, that I was not worthy of our pack's name, and that I should be grateful to be sent to the Humans, to learn from them and bring back knowledge that would benefit our pack. But I knew it was a lie, a way for her to get rid of me, to silence me, to keep me from speaking out against the injustices that plagued our pack, and the cruel treatment of those who were different, like me. And so I left, with a heavy heart, and a sense of betrayal that still burns within me to this day, a flame that fuels my determination to prove them all wrong, to show them that I am not fangless, that I am strong, and that I will not be silenced."
"“They see a wedding between a Vampyre and an Alpha that was supposed to broker peace, but ended in death. The Weres are animals, and always will be, but we are on","the road to extinction, and the good of the most must be considered. If we let the Humans and Weres form an alliance that excludes us, they could completely wipe us out—”",64,"the cusp of a new era, one where our kind can coexist with the Vampyres, and perhaps even learn from them. The union of the two leaders, though tragic, has opened doors to a world of possibilities, and we must not let the fear of the unknown hold us back. The Weres have always been a force to be reckoned with, but now we have the chance to prove that we are more than just beasts, that we are capable of love, of loyalty, and of sacrifice. The question is, will we seize this opportunity, or will we let it slip through our paws like sand in the wind?"
"I only ever laughed out loud with Serena, which means that it must have been well over a month since I last did","it. My brain nearly hiccups, startled at these newfangled, mysterious sounds my voice box is producing. “Did you drink rotten blood? Because you’re unhinged.”",47,"since that carefree, joyful moment when we were still in college, and life was full of endless possibilities, before the weight of reality and responsibility began to settle in, and our paths diverged in ways we never could have imagined, leaving me with only memories of her infectious laughter and the warmth of our friendship."
"“Vampyres cannot.” I shoot to my feet and begin pacing away from him,",massaging my temple. “Why are you asking me? I cannot be your first choice.”,27,"as if the very words themselves had unleashed a torrent of restless energy within me, and I must move to contain the turmoil that threatens to consume me whole."
"“You aren’t,” he says flatly. He has plenty of faults, but lack of honesty was never among them. “Nor our second. The council is","in agreement that we must act, and several members have offered their relatives. Originally, Councilman Essen’s daughter agreed. But she had a change of heart—”",49,"not aware of any evidence that would implicate either of you in the theft. However, I must admit that the circumstances surrounding the missing artifact do seem suspicious, and I would like to ask you both a few questions to clarify the events of that evening. The council is known for its fairness and impartiality, but it's also not above taking drastic measures when necessary, especially when it comes to matters of great importance like this one. I'm sure you understand that, and I'm sure you'll cooperate fully with our investigation. Now, let's start with the basics: can either of you tell me where you were between the hours of 9 and 11 pm on the night of the theft?"
"And yet, here I am. With Governor Davenport. Leaning on my elbows over the balcony",that overlooks the courtyard where I just got married. Biting back a sigh before explaining:,30,"of the grand ballroom, I gaze out at the sea of faces below, their masks glinting like a thousand tiny mirrors in the flickering candlelight, as the strains of the orchestra dance through the air, a lively waltz that seems to match the rhythm of my own pounding heart, and I wonder, what secrets lie hidden behind these painted smiles and powdered wigs, and what mysteries await me in this night of nights, as I stand here, a pawn in a game I barely understand, yet somehow, inexplicably, a part of."
"Gauging intoxication levels in Humans is always a struggle, but I’m fairly sure the governor",is not not drunk. “You asked who gave me my name. It was the Vampyre council.”,31,"was completely drunk, stumbling over his own words and nearly face-planting into the podium, much to the amusement of the entire press corps."
"Serena was like that, too, when I first met her. “So crucifixes burn you?” she asked me a couple of weeks","into our cohabitation, after I failed to convince her that the viscous red liquid I kept in my fridge was tomato juice.",43,"ago, her eyes sparkling with a mix of curiosity and amusement, as if she was trying to gauge my reaction, and I remember feeling a shiver run down my spine, not just because of the question itself, but because of the way she said it, with a hint of a smile that seemed to suggest she knew more than she was letting on, and I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets she might be hiding behind those piercing green eyes, and how I had managed to stumble into her orbit, and what it was about her that drew me in like a moth to a flame, and whether I was ready for the fire that seemed to burn within her, and whether I was prepared to get burned myself."
"“Shit,” I mutter softly, rubbing the bridge of my nose. Was Moreland married before? If that’s the case, I cannot comprehend how pissed he must be","at the prospect of being shackled to me while his wife is far away, first in line to the slaughter. Maybe that’s why he flipped earlier?",52,"that his wife's family is now being threatened by the very people he's trying to protect. The thought sends a shiver down my spine as I recall the look in his eyes when he mentioned the name ""Blackwood"" – a mix of anger and desperation that I've only seen in a few people before, and none of them were exactly pleasant company. I wonder if there's more to this case than meets the eye, and whether Moreland's involvement is just a coincidence or a deliberate attempt to draw me in. The more I think about it, the more questions I have, and I'm starting to feel like I'm just scratching the surface of a much larger, more complex web of secrets and lies."
"Moreland presses his lips together. His jaw clenches and he says something, but his voice","is deeper, lower than his companions’. I cannot make out the words over the background noises.",31,"is barely audible, and his eyes seem to bore into the soul of the person he is speaking to, as if daring them to contradict him, his words hanging in the air like a challenge, a gauntlet thrown down in a battle of wills."
"A short distance away, two children are bawling. They are toddlers, one with dark skin and lilac eyes, the other pale and blue-eyed. A Vampyre and a Were. Between them lies a dark blue superhero action figure, broken in two at the waist. And next to them, clutching their respective sons,","are a Vampyre father and a Were mother. Who, for reasons I cannot divine, thought that bringing children here would be a good idea, and now are showing their fangs at each other. Growling. Drawing the attention of the other guests, who start to gather around them protectively. Or maybe aggressively.",102,"stands a young woman with a look of desperation etched on her face, her long, curly brown hair disheveled, and a hint of fang marks on her neck, while a tall, brooding figure with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair stands beside her, his eyes fixed intently on the broken toy, his jaw clenched in a mixture of anger and concern. The air is thick with tension as the two parents try to comfort their children, who are wailing uncontrollably, their tiny bodies shaking with sobs. The Vampyre mother's eyes dart towards the Were father, a silent plea for help, while the Were father's eyes never leave the broken toy, his mind racing with the implications of what this might mean for their family's already fragile existence in a world where supernatural creatures are not always accepted. The scene is one of chaos and uncertainty, a microcosm of the larger struggles that many supernatural families face in this world, where prejudice and fear often run deep."
"“It’s all good,” Moreland says. Calm. Reassuring. Not to the father, but to","the child. As he holds out the intact action figure—not broken, after all.",26,"the anxious mother, who is clinging to his arm, her eyes wide with worry, as she glances back and forth between her son and the darkening sky, the wind picking up, the trees swaying ominously in the distance, their leaves rustling softly, a sense of foreboding settling over the group, the air thickening with an unspoken understanding that something is very wrong."
"“Anything you’d like to say?” Moreland asks, this time to the Were child.",The boy blinks several times before looking at the ground with a pout.,26,"though the child's eyes remain fixed on the ground, its small face a mask of stoic determination, as if the weight of the question has somehow managed to pierce the veil of its innocence, and the silence that follows is heavy with unspoken words and unresolved emotions."
"“Make sure it doesn’t happen again. Tell the others, too,” he quietly orders the ginger and the older Were, who nod and leave","to mix with the guests. Moreland sighs, and I wait for a handful of seconds, hoping he’ll join them and clear my way.",46,"as they disappear into the shadows, their eyes scanning the surrounding area for any signs of potential threats, while the young Were's gaze lingers on the spot where the attack occurred, a mix of fear and determination etched on his face, and the older Were's expression a stern reminder of the consequences of failure, the air thick with an unspoken understanding of the gravity of their situation."
"“I know you’re there,” he says, not looking at anyone in particular. I","have no idea who he’s addressing until he adds, “Come down, Miss Lark.”",26,"feel a shiver run down my spine as he pauses, his voice barely above a whisper, and the room falls silent, the only sound the soft hum of the fluorescent lights above."
"No, we Vampyres don’t pulverize in the sun like glitter bombs. Sunlight burns us and it hurts, but it won’t kill us unless the exposure is unfiltered and prolonged. However, we are pretty useless in the middle of the day, even inside.","Lethargic and weak and crawly and headachy, especially during late spring and summer, when the rays hit at that pesky steep angle. “This crepuscularity of yours is really cramping my brunch lifestyle,” Serena used to say. “Also, the fact that you don’t eat.”",85,"our powers are significantly diminished, and our movements become sluggish and labored, making it difficult for us to hunt or even defend ourselves. In fact, the intense heat and UV radiation can cause our skin to become dry and cracked, making us appear almost...human. It's a peculiar irony, really, that the very thing that's supposed to be our greatest weakness is also what makes us appear so vulnerable. But don't be fooled – we're not as helpless as we seem. We've learned to adapt, to find ways to survive in a world that's hostile to our very existence. And when the sun dips below the horizon, and the shadows grow long and dark, we come alive, our powers surging back to life like a pent-up storm. We are the creatures of the night, and we will not be defeated by the fleeting weakness of the sun."
"Ana sighs, and rolls her eyes, and pouts like she was asked to file a tax return, but eventually she does","leave, sneaking me an impish smile. My sleep-addled brain briefly considers returning it, then recalls that I let my fangs regrow.",42,"get up from the couch, and trudges over to the kitchen, where she begins to rummage through the fridge, searching for something, anything, to satisfy her late-night cravings, her stomach growling with anticipation, as she scans the shelves, her eyes scanning the leftovers, the takeout containers, and the expired yogurt, her mind racing with the possibilities, and her taste buds tingling with excitement, as she finally spots a half-eaten pizza that had been lingering in the back of the fridge since the weekend, and a spark of hope ignites within her, as she carefully unwraps the box, and takes a tentative bite, the cheese stretching and the sauce oozing, and the flavors exploding on her tongue, and for a moment, all her worries and cares seem to melt away, as she savors the simple pleasure of a midnight snack."
"“It will be different here.” Her eyes move from mine and trace the contours of the room, still a mess of moving boxes and piles of clothes. Her gaze hiccups on the bare mattress, now stripped of the sheets and blankets that I dragged inside the closet, then stops on the only thing I put up on the wall: a Polaroid of me and Serena","looking away from the camera during that sunset lake tour we did two years ago. Some guy took it without asking, while we were dangling our feet in the water. Then he showed it to us and said he’d only return it if one of us gave him our number. We did the only logical thing: caught him in a headlock and forcibly took the photo.",131,"that I took on our last day of summer, the one where the sun was setting over the lake, casting a warm orange glow over our smiling faces, and for a moment, everything felt like it was going to be okay. Her eyes linger on the faded colors and the creases in the photo, and I can see the faintest glimmer of a smile playing on her lips, but it's quickly extinguished as she turns back to me, her expression a mask of uncertainty. She takes a deep breath, and I can see the tension in her shoulders ease slightly, but her eyes still hold a hint of wariness, as if she's waiting for me to say something, to do something, to prove that I'm still here, that I'm still the same person she fell in love with. But I'm not sure I know how to do that anymore, or if I even want to."
"No shit. “And I don’t know you enough to make a judgment. Your jeans are cool,","though.” Riveting conversation, but I’m about to pass out. Thankfully, with one last withering look, Juno leaves.",33,but that's not enough to convince me that you're not just another wannabe trying to fit in with the crowd.
"The corner of my eye catches a hint of movement. I turn, half expecting Ana to make","a comeback, but it’s just Serena’s goddamned fucking cat, stretching his way out from under the bed.",34,"be some wisecrack or sarcastic remark, but instead, I see her standing there, her eyes fixed intently on the old, mysterious-looking book lying open on the dusty shelf, her face a picture of quiet contemplation, as if the secrets it holds have somehow awakened a deep longing within her."
"Growing up collecting attempted murders like milk teeth tempered me and taught me to be calm under pressure. And yet I still remember it, that first churning twist in my stomach when Serena didn’t","turn up to my place for laundry night. Didn’t reply to my texts. Didn’t pick up the phone. Didn’t call in sick to work, and simply stopped showing up. It felt a lot like fear.",69,"answer the phone, her voice on the other end of the line a hesitant whisper that sent a shiver down my spine, the sound of her words barely audible over the hum of the refrigerator in the background, and I knew in that instant that something was terribly wrong, that the calm façade I had built around myself was about to be shattered, and I was left standing there, frozen in a mixture of fear and anticipation, wondering what had happened, and why she was calling me in the dead of night, her words spilling out in a rush, a jumbled mess of tears and desperation, and I was powerless to do anything but listen, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios, my heart pounding in my chest like a drum, as I tried to make sense of the chaos that was unfolding before me."
"“A few days? She still wouldn’t let the little asshole starve,” I hurried to add, but the officer had already dropped his pen. And even though I went back to the station three times that week, and eventually managed to get a missing person report filed, no one did anything","to find Serena. The hazard, I guess, of being alone in the world: no one to care that she was safe, and healthy, and alive. No one but me, and I didn’t count. I shouldn’t have been surprised, and I wasn’t. But apparently I still had the capacity to feel hurt.",101,"about it, and it wasn't until I showed up at the precinct the fourth time, visibly shaken and armed with a stack of photographs and witness statements, that they finally took me seriously. The officer who had initially dismissed me looked up from his desk, a mixture of annoyance and curiosity etched on his face, and asked what I was doing back there. I took a deep breath and launched into the whole story again, this time with more detail and emotion, and to my surprise, he listened intently, his expression softening as I spoke. When I finished, he nodded thoughtfully and picked up the phone, dialing a number with a look of determination on his face. ""We'll look into it,"" he said, his voice firm, and for the first time since my sister had gone missing, I felt a glimmer of hope."
"Because no one cared whether I was safe, or healthy, or alive. No one but Serena. The sister of my heart,","if not of my blood. And even though I’d been plenty alone, I’d never felt so lonely as after she was gone.",43,"who had been my rock, my confidante, and my guiding light in the darkest of times, stood by me through every storm, and her unwavering love and support gave me the strength to carry on, even when all hope seemed lost, and the world around me was crumbling."
"I had the keys, after all. Because the key to everything is but a line of code. I was able to rifle through her bank statements, IP addresses, cell phone locations. Herald emails, metadata, app usage. Serena was a journalist, one who","wrote about delicate financial stuff, and the most likely option was that she’d gotten embroiled in something fishy while working on a story, but I wasn’t going to exclude other possibilities. So I went through everything, and found . . . nothing.",84,"kept meticulous records of her sources, contacts, and leads, which made her digital footprint a treasure trove for someone like me, a skilled hacker with a personal vendetta. I dug deeper, uncovering a web of connections that went far beyond a simple news story, revealing a complex network of powerful individuals and organizations that seemed to be hiding in plain sight. The more I dug, the more I realized that Serena's investigation had been getting close to something big, something that could bring down empires and shake the very foundations of our society. I knew I had to be careful, as I was now walking a thin line between curiosity and obsession, but I couldn't help myself, I had to know more, and so I continued to dig, following the digital breadcrumbs that led me further and further down the rabbit hole, into a world of corruption, deceit, and conspiracy."
"And that’s when I did it: I kneeled in front of Serena’s damn fucking cat. He was playing like he always did after dinner, pawing at a crumpled receipt in a corner of the living room, but managed to squeeze a couple of hisses into his busy schedule just for me. “Listen.” I swallowed. Rubbed my","hand on my chest and then even slapped it, trying to dull the ache. “I know you only knew her for a few days, but I really, really . . .” I scrunched my eyes shut. Oh fuck, this was hard. “I don’t know how it happened, but I think that Serena might be . . .”",113,"my palms together, trying to calm down the racing of my heart, and took a deep breath. The air was thick with the scent of old books and stale air, and for a moment, I forgot about the reason I was there. But then I remembered the words, echoing in my mind like a mantra: ""You have to tell her."" I looked up at Serena, who was watching me with an unreadable expression, her eyes fixed on me like a hawk. I took another deep breath, and began to speak, my voice barely above a whisper. ""Serena, I need to tell you something. It's about your cat."" I paused, studying her reaction, but her face remained impassive. I continued, my words spilling out in a rush. ""I know it sounds crazy, but I think he's trying to tell us something."" I glanced down at the cat, who was now staring at me with an unblinking gaze, as if waiting for me to continue."
"The receipt, which wasn’t a balled-up receipt at all. It was a piece of paper","torn from a journal, or perhaps a notebook, or—no. A planner. Serena’s incredibly outdated planner.",30,"was carefully folded and tucked away in the back of a dusty old wallet, its edges worn and frayed from years of being carried around, and it seemed to hold secrets and stories of a life long past, one that was both familiar and yet, utterly foreign."
"Or maybe not quite. A distant bell rang, reminding me of a game Serena and I used to play as kids, a primitive substitution cipher we made up to gossip freely in front of our caregivers. We’d named it the butterfly alphabet, and","it mostly consisted of adding b- and f- syllables to normal words. Nothing complicated: even rusty as I was, it took my brain only a few seconds to untangle it. And once I was done, I had something. I had three whole words:",86,"it involved replacing each letter with a corresponding letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet, a simple yet effective way to conceal our secrets from prying ears. The memory of it brought a faint smile to my face as I stood there, the sound of the bell still echoing in my mind, and I couldn't help but wonder if the game had been more than just a childish diversion, a way for us to communicate in code, perhaps even a precursor to the encrypted messages I'd been receiving lately, or maybe it was just my imagination running wild, but the thought sent a shiver down my spine as I turned to leave, the bell's faint chime still resonating within me."
"I didn’t scream, or cry, or attack that old hag. I was paralyzed, unable to function properly for the rest of the night, and only started processing what had happened when I","got home and told Serena, who was furious on my behalf and demanded a promise from the caregiver on shift: that I would never be forced to attend a similar function again.",64,"was shaken awake by the sound of my own voice, whispering the words over and over in my mind like a mantra, as if trying to convince myself that it was all just a terrible dream, but the memory of her bony fingers and the feeling of her icy breath on my skin lingered, refusing to be shaken off, and it wasn't until the first light of dawn crept into my room that I finally found the strength to get out of bed and try to make sense of the events of the previous night, but the more I thought about it, the more questions I had, and the more I realized that I was in over my head, and that I needed to talk to someone about it, but who could I trust, and how could I possibly explain what had happened, and as I stood there, frozen in indecision, I heard a faint knock at the door, and my heart skipped a beat as I wondered if it was her, come to finish what she had started, or if it was something else entirely, something that would change everything."
"“Yes, thank you.” He nearly slumps in relief. “And, um, there are","no blood banks that cater to Vampyres in the area, because, well—”",24,"several other things I'd like to discuss with you, but I'm not sure where to start, or even if you'll be willing to listen, but I have to try, because I've been carrying this around for far too long, and it's eating away at me, and I need someone to talk to, someone who might actually understand, and I know you're not like the others, you're different, you see things in a way that no one else does, and I'm hoping that you can help me make sense of it all, and maybe, just maybe, we can find a way to move forward, together, and leave all this behind us, once and for all."
"“Are you one of his seconds?” I ask Alex, turning away","from the waves lapping at the pier. “More— Lowe’s, I mean.”",22,"from the crowd, my voice barely above a whisper, as I try to gauge his reaction to the question."
"Alex mulls it. “Yes and no. There are some instincts that take over in that form, more than they otherwise would. The impulse to hunt,","for instance, is very powerful. To chase a scent, track down an enemy. That’s why you maybe shouldn’t venture out alone to . . .”",50,"is a primal one, deeply ingrained in our DNA, a leftover from a time when survival depended on the ability to track and pursue prey. But in this case, the instinct is warped, perverted by the artificial constructs of the virtual world, where the thrill of the hunt is amplified by the anonymity and the thrill of the unknown. Alex's eyes narrow as he considers the implications, his mind racing with the possibilities, the what-ifs and the maybes, as he tries to reconcile the rational and the primal, the human and the machine."
Alex lets out a startled laugh. “He is the most powerful Were I’ve,ever seen. And that my grandfather has ever seen—and he’s seen many Alphas.”,26,"ever met, and I'm not just saying that because he's the alpha of our pack. His strength and speed are unmatched, but it's his strategic mind that truly sets him apart. He's the one who's been leading us to victory in every battle, and I have no doubt he'll continue to do so in the years to come."
Serena’s face flashes through my head. She’s rolling her eyes because I’m wearing a galaxy T-shirt I,"got for free when I bought a lava lamp. Who wears this, Misery? No—who buys a lava lamp?",35,"had borrowed from her closet without asking, and I can almost hear her teasing me about how I'm trying to be a space cadet, but the memory is bittersweet because it's been a while since I've seen her, and I wonder if she's doing okay, and I think about the last time we talked, and how we both knew it was the start of something that would eventually come to an end, and I wonder if she's moved on, and if she's happy, and if she ever thinks about me too, and the thought sends a pang through my chest, and I push it aside, but it lingers, a reminder of the complicated web of emotions that comes with losing someone you care about, and the uncertainty of what the future holds, and the what-ifs that haunt me still."
"“Except, now I live here.” I play with my silver wedding band—a habit I’ve picked up in less than twenty-four hours. I’ve never been much for jewelry, but maybe I’ll",keep it when I find Serena and this is over. Or buy one of those mood rings that think Vampyres are always sad because our body temperature is low. “Why?”,60,"start to see the appeal, especially since it's a symbol of the life I've built here, the love I've found, and the memories I've made with my husband, who's been patiently waiting for me to adjust to this new chapter, and as I glance at the ring, I'm reminded of the countless ways in which our relationship has grown stronger with each passing day, and I feel a sense of gratitude and contentment wash over me, like the gentle lapping of waves against the shore of a peaceful lake."
"The first time I searched online for L. E. Moreland, I found two things: a","semi-defunct GeoCities website promoting a wholly defunct real estate agent, and the infinite vastness of nothing.",31,"a Wikipedia article about a British engineer from the 19th century, and a series of cryptic forum posts speculating about the existence of a reclusive author with the same name, whose works were supposedly hidden away in dusty archives and private collections, fueling the imagination of book collectors and literary enthusiasts for decades, with some even claiming to have stumbled upon fragments of her writing in obscure libraries and second-hand bookstores, but the authenticity of these claims remained dubious and open to interpretation, leaving many to wonder if the truth behind the legend was more fascinating than fiction itself."
"Deep in a Human server with ties to the governor’s office, hidden in a memo locked behind a bewildering number of passwords, I",discovered a communication regarding a summit that had occurred a couple of weeks earlier. Around the time Serena hadn’t shown up for laundry night.,47,"found a cryptic reference to a clandestine meeting between the governor and a high-ranking official from a foreign government, which seemed to hint at a clandestine deal that could have far-reaching implications for the country's national security and the governor's own political future."
"“What’s the plan?” Serena would ask if she were here, even though the little schemes she hatched never worked out. She liked the vibe of organizing","more than the actual job of it, and my usually impervious heart clenches a little at the thought that I cannot call her out on it.",52,"in the background, orchestrating events with a flair for the dramatic, but her impulsive nature often led to chaos, and her friends had grown accustomed to cleaning up the mess."
"“I didn’t think Vampyres could be beautiful.” There’s nothing complimentary about his words. He’s neither hitting on me, nor attempting to creep me out. Just stating a","simple fact, followed by another step toward me, and I’m suddenly very conscious that I’m at the end of a hallway. He stands between me and the exit.",55,"fact, and I can see why he'd think that. His eyes are sunken, his skin is deathly pale, and his fangs are razor-sharp. He's a creature of the night, a being of darkness and shadow, and yet, there's something captivating about him, something that draws me in, something that makes me want to know more about this mysterious being who stands before me, his piercing gaze fixed intently on mine, his voice low and husky, sending shivers down my spine as he continues to speak, his words dripping with an otherworldly intensity that's both mesmerizing and terrifying."
"“I doubt it.” I want to put a door between myself and Max, but the only one I can reach","is Lowe’s office—locked. I glance around for another escape route, but all I find is a giraffe painting of questionable quality.",41,"is the one that leads to the backyard, and I'm not sure I'm ready to face whatever is waiting for me out there, the sound of the wind rustling through the trees making me feel like I'm being watched, the memory of Max's words echoing in my mind like a haunting melody that refuses to fade away, the darkness outside seeming to press in on me like a physical force, making my skin crawl with unease, and I wonder if I'm making a huge mistake by trying to escape, but I know I have to try, for my own sanity, for my own survival, and I take a deep breath and push the door open, the creaking of the hinges sounding loud in the stillness, and I step out into the unknown."
"“Remember what your people have taken from him. It’s almost as much as they’ve taken from me. And yet he’s making alliances with them like a common traitor. He married you, and said that","you’re not to be harmed.” Max runs a hand over his dark hair, and then shakes his head in what looks like disbelief. He looks so deeply lost, I forget my unease and ask:",68,"he would love and honor you above all others, but now he's more concerned with their approval and their wealth than with the well-being of those he's sworn to protect, including you and our child."
"A pair of hands a million times stronger than Max’s yanks me away. What happens next is too blurry to parse, but a moment later, I’m the","one sandwiched against the opposing wall. My back digs into the frame of the giraffe painting, and my front presses against something just as unyielding, but warm.",54,"one who finds myself standing in the middle of a dimly lit alleyway, the cool night air a stark contrast to the sweltering heat of the summer evening, with Max nowhere to be seen, and a faint sense of unease creeping up my spine as I struggle to recall the events that led me here, my mind racing with questions and my heart pounding in my chest like a drum, the only sound breaking the silence being the distant hum of a city that never sleeps, and the soft whisper of a stranger's voice in my ear, ""Are you okay?"""
"“Max came over, saw me, decided to indulge in some light afternoon","murder.” I shrug. “That, I’m used to. It’s the subsequent lying that—”",24,"tea, and we exchanged a few pleasantries before he asked if I had any news to share, which I did, and he listened intently, his expression a mix of concern and curiosity, as he sat down beside me on the couch, his eyes never leaving mine, and I could sense a hint of unease beneath his calm demeanor, which only added to my growing sense of trepidation."
“Leave us.” Lowe’s sharp voice reminds us that we’re not alone in the room.,We turn at once. And we’re equally shocked to see that he’s addressing Juno.,28,"and the presence of the others, though they try to appear nonchalant, is a stark reminder that our conversation is no longer a private one."
"This situation is a problem. The Collateral is supposed to be a nonplayable character in a video game. For the next year,","I need to be invisible, unobtrusive as I search for Serena. Not the kind of nuisance who gets caught murdering a young Were.",45,"it was decided that the Collateral would remain in a state of limbo, neither fully implemented nor fully removed, as the developers struggled to find a way to integrate it into the game without disrupting the delicate balance of the narrative and gameplay mechanics. Meanwhile, the community was left to speculate about the character's true purpose and the potential consequences of its existence, with some players even creating their own fan theories and artwork to fill in the gaps. As the months went by, the Collateral became a sort of urban legend within the gaming community, with some players claiming to have caught glimpses of it in the game's code or seen it lurking in the background of certain levels. Despite the lack of official confirmation, the Collateral continued to capture the imagination of players, inspiring a sense of mystery and intrigue that only added to the game's allure."
His eyebrow lifts. “I’m sure you have some excellent advice on where else I should house the,"daughter of the most powerful Vampyre in the council, who’s apparently a fearsome fighter in her own right.”",35,"my collection, considering the current state of the storage facilities in the old mansion, perhaps the attic would be a suitable alternative, or maybe even the abandoned wing on the east side, but I must warn you, sir, the east wing has been uninhabitable for decades, and the rumors about it being haunted are quite persistent among the staff."
"It’s amusing to me, the idea that someone who has skimmed a synopsis of my life would assume I’ve had any sort","of romantic entanglement. With whom? A Vampyre, when they only see me as a traitor? A Human, who would consider me a monster?",45,"of control over the narrative, that I've carefully curated every detail to present a cohesive and relatable image, when in reality, my life has been a messy, chaotic tapestry of moments both beautiful and brutal, with threads of uncertainty and self-doubt woven throughout, and it's only by embracing these imperfections that I've managed to find a semblance of purpose and meaning, a fragile balance between the highs and lows that has allowed me to grow and learn, and it's this authenticity that I hope to convey through my words, not some sanitized, glossy version of myself that I've been conditioned to present to the world."
"There might be something stunted about me. After the Collateral term was over, Serena and I were free to venture into the outside world, to be with people who weren’t our tutors or our caregivers, to fall in love and make friends. Serena jumped right into that, but I could","never bring myself to. Partly because the closer I’d let someone get to me, the harder it’d be to hide who I was. Or maybe spending the first eighteen years of my life becoming acquainted with the cruelty of all species didn’t quite set me up for a bright future.",100,"not help but feel a sense of trepidation, a lingering fear that I was somehow broken, that the isolation and strict rules of our upbringing had left an indelible mark on my psyche. I watched as Serena effortlessly navigated the complexities of social interactions, her confidence and charm drawing people to her like a magnet. Meanwhile, I struggled to find my footing, unsure of how to respond to the simplest of questions or how to initiate a conversation. It was as if I had been programmed to be a certain way, to think a certain way, and the world outside our little bubble was a vast and overwhelming place. I felt like a puzzle piece that didn't quite fit, and the more I tried to force myself into the mold, the more I felt like I was going to shatter into a million pieces. I began to wonder if I was destined to be alone, forever stuck in this limbo of uncertainty, unable to connect with others or find my place in the world."
"“But then you’d get mad because Father and I weren’t paying attention to you, and wander off on your own, grumbling about",the oddest things. Let me know if that changes. Have you been talking with the Were Collateral? Has she mentioned anything about Loyals?”,45,"how unfair it was that we always got to do the fun things together, while you were stuck at home, watching the clock tick by, waiting for us to return, and how it wasn't fair that we got to have all the adventures and you were left to deal with the chores and responsibilities, and how it wasn't fair that we got to have all the attention and you were left feeling invisible and unimportant, and how it wasn't fair that we got to have all the fun and you were left with nothing but boredom and frustration."
"“That’s a bad word,” Ana says, giggling in a delighted, tickled way that",has me feeling like an improv genius. She’s flattering company. “What’s your name?”,26,"made her eyes sparkle with mirth, but her brother, Jack, just rolled his eyes and muttered under his breath, ""You're going to get us in trouble one of these days, Ana."""
It feels like the middle of the night when Ana yawns and decides it’s,"time to go back to her room. “My cat is waiting for me, anyway.”",28,"is time to get some rest, but the darkness outside her window seems to be stirring, and the distant hum of the city is a reminder that it's not as quiet as she thought."
"I follow her progress, terrified, wondering if this is motherhood: anxiously picturing your child with her skull cracked open. But Ana knows exactly what she’s","doing, and when she has hoisted herself on top of the roof and disappeared from my view, I’m left alone with two separate pieces of knowledge:",51,"doing, and I'm not sure if I should be relieved or terrified by the calm, detached way she's going about it, her hands moving with a precision that's almost surgical, as if she's dissecting a specimen rather than giving birth to a human being."
"It’s a barbecue, or a potluck, or a cookout—I never quite got the difference, despite Serena’s explanations on the nuances of Human social get-togethers. Vampyres don’t really build community this way,","by assembling without an agenda. Our friendships are alliances. I didn’t encounter the concept of hanging out, of spending time with someone for the sake of it, until my Collateral years.",62,"but we do have our own gatherings, like the Blood Moon feasts, where we come together to celebrate the full moon and the abundance of the night. Serena's attempts to explain the concept of a casual, daytime gathering were met with confusion, as I struggled to grasp the idea of people voluntarily congregating in the open, without the need for the shadows to protect them. The thought of it was almost as foreign to me as the notion of wearing clothes in the daylight. I watched as Serena tried to describe the smell of grilled meats and the sound of laughter, but it was like trying to describe a sunset to someone who had never seen the sky. I couldn't help but wonder if these Human gatherings were truly as carefree as they seemed, or if there was something more to them that I was missing."
"He’s separate from the rest of the crowd, on the outskirts of the beach, where the sand first turns into shrubs, then thickens with forest trees. At first glance, I don’t think much of it: unlike most of the","partygoers, he’s wearing a long-sleeved shirt and jeans, but hey. I’ve been a self-conscious teen before, trying to hide with clothes the way I’d shot up about six inches in three months. And melanoma is evil, according to Serena.",78,"crowd, he's not there to enjoy the sun, sea, or surf, but rather to escape the chaos and noise that comes with it. His eyes are fixed on the horizon, lost in thought, as if searching for something or someone. The sound of the waves crashing against the shore creates a soothing melody that seems to calm his troubled mind, but his expression remains a mix of sadness and longing. He's a man consumed by his own thoughts, and the world around him is just a blur. The trees sway gently in the breeze, their leaves rustling softly, but he doesn't seem to notice. His gaze remains fixed on the horizon, a distant look in his eyes, as if he's trying to recall a memory or a moment from his past. The sun beats down on him, but he doesn't flinch, lost in his own world, a world that's separate from the one he's physically in. His presence is a stark contrast to the vibrant colors and lively atmosphere of the beach, a reminder that even in the midst of beauty and joy, there can be pain and sorrow."
"Except. Something pulls me back to the window. I don’t like it. The way he’s talking to Ana, pointing at","someplace I cannot see, someplace between the trees. Ana shakes her head—no. But he seems to insist, and . . .",41,"the old, worn photograph in her hand, his words dripping with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion, as if he's trying to uncover a long-buried secret, and I feel a shiver run down my spine as I wonder what he's really after, what he's really looking for in that faded image, and why it seems to be drawing him in with an otherworldly pull."
"He’s probably in the restroom, and I consider looking for him there. Then decide there’s no time. A couple of stray neural cells lurch awake to point out that","this is the perfect time for me to break into Lowe’s office and search for intel on Serena. The remaining 99 percent of my brain, sadly, is focused on Ana.",59,"it's possible he might have stepped out for some fresh air, or perhaps he's dealing with an unexpected phone call, and I should probably check the lobby or the café downstairs, but the clock is ticking and I really need to get this meeting started."
"“Let me go,” Max whines. Like me, he’s sitting on a couch. Unlike me, his hands are tied behind his back, and",he’s being watched by several guards with the kind of icy treatment one would reserve for someone who tried to kidnap a child.,45,"he's staring at me with a mixture of fear and desperation in his eyes, his legs stretched out in front of him, his feet tapping impatiently on the cold, hardwood floor, the dim light of the room casting eerie shadows on the walls as the sound of distant sirens echoes through the air, and I'm starting to wonder if I've made a terrible mistake by bringing him here, to this place, to this situation, where the line between right and wrong is blurred, and the only thing that's certain is that we're both in grave danger."
"I’m not quite sure what he wants to know, so I go for what feels right. “Ana has been visiting,” I say, matching his tone. “She keeps me company, and even","though she’s terrible at pronouncing my name and clearly doesn’t know whether she’s six or seven . . .” I swallow. “I’d rather she doesn’t get, you know. Kidnapped and trafficked.”",62,"helps me with the household chores, which is a big relief, especially with my mother still recovering from her surgery."
"I let his words churn around me for several minutes after he leaves, wondering whether he’s right. When","they grind to a stop, I know he isn’t: I did have a home, and her name was Serena.",37,"the silence that follows his departure is broken only by the faint hum of the air conditioner and the distant sound of the city outside, I find myself lost in thought, replaying our conversation over and over in my mind, searching for any hint of deception or ulterior motive, but his words continue to linger, like a faint whisper in my ear, echoing with a haunting truth that I'm not sure I'm ready to confront."
"The sun is setting, but I don’t turn on the lights. Lowe’s desk is given away","by Ana’s grinning picture. I tiptoe there, kneel in front of the keyboard, and start messing around.",33,"by the shadows, and the only sound is the soft hum of the computer, a reminder that the work is far from over, as I sit here, staring at the stack of files and notes, trying to make sense of it all, the weight of responsibility settling in, the clock ticking away, and I wonder if I'm truly ready for this."
And this wolf’s . . . This wolf’s fangs could win contests. Rule civilizations. Get their owner,"engaged, married, and very much laid at any Vampyre party. And they could shred me into M&M’s.",34,"to the pinnacle of power, for in the eyes of many, strength and ferocity were the only currencies that truly mattered, and this wolf's prowess was unmatched, its reputation spreading far and wide, striking fear into the hearts of even the bravest warriors."
"“Come in,” he orders, and I cannot comprehend how I didn’t notice Alex idling by the","door. Too busy contemplating my imminent demise, probably. “Can you figure out what she was doing?”",32,"the corner of the street, his eyes fixed intently on the old mansion, his presence seeming to blend seamlessly into the shadows as I stepped inside, the heavy wooden door creaking shut behind me, enveloping me in an eerie silence."
"“She—very astutely, I must say, and with only very primitive tools at","her disposal—hacked into our servers,” Alex announces. A little admiringly, which is flattering.",25,"her disposal—managed to craft a small, yet remarkably intricate, wooden box, which she carefully adorned with various symbols and markings that seemed to hold great significance to her."
“Yup. I’m the leader of our security team.” He sounds distracted as he combs through,my code. Whatever fear he had when we were alone doesn’t hold if his Alpha’s present.,31,"his phone, his eyes scanning the screen with a mixture of frustration and concern, the dim lighting of the control room casting an eerie glow on his face as he tries to make sense of the chaos unfolding outside."
"“Nice job.” Weird, how I’m having a conversation with Alex but staring",up into Lowe’s eyes. About an inch from mine. “It’s pretty impenetrable.”,24,"at the stranger sitting across from me, his eyes locked onto mine with an unnerving intensity, as if he could see right through to the very soul of me."
“I have to consider this as an act of aggression on behalf of your father and the rest of the Vampyre council. They sent a,"plant into Were territory under the guise of Collateral.” His jaw hardens. “And your scent—they tampered with it, didn’t they? They knew it would distract me—”",51,"sent a clear message that they will not tolerate any further interference in their affairs, and that we should not underestimate their power and influence in the shadows. The fact that they chose to make an example out of you, a low-ranking member of our coven, serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of crossing them. It is imperative that we take this threat seriously and take immediate action to protect ourselves and our allies, lest we suffer the same fate as you."
"Ana stamps a kiss on Lowe’s cheek, mutters something delighted about how prickly it is, and then slips out in a","flurry of blue and pink fabric. My eyes stay with her, and then on the ajar door, long after she disappears.",42,"hurry to join the rest of the group, who are all gathered around the campfire, their faces aglow with excitement and curiosity as they await her return with the long-awaited news from the nearby village, where rumors of a hidden waterfall have been circulating for weeks, and Ana's expedition is the first to attempt to verify its existence, and as she disappears into the darkness, the fire crackles and spits, casting eerie shadows on the surrounding trees, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers, and the distant howl of a wolf can be heard, a haunting melody that sends shivers down the spines of even the most seasoned adventurers, and as the minutes tick by, the group's anticipation grows, their eyes fixed on the spot where Ana vanished, their hearts pounding in unison with the rhythmic beat of the crickets, and the darkness seems to grow thicker, like a palpable entity, as if it too is waiting with bated breath for Ana's return, and the outcome of her perilous journey."
"“You thought I had a martyrdom complex?” I hug my legs to my chest, watching his lips as they close around the rim","of his mug. “I have no allegiance to the Vampyres. Or the Humans, with a single exception. And I’m going to find her.”",46,"of the cup, the sound of the clinking ice cubes a stark contrast to the silence that had fallen between us, and for a moment, I wonder if he's trying to drown his sorrows or mine, his eyes never leaving mine as he takes a sip, the condensation on the glass glistening in the dim light of the bar, the air thick with unspoken words and unresolved tension."
"Serena loved berries, and I tried memorizing their names, but they’re so counterintuitive. Blueberries? Not blue. Blackberries? Not","black. Strawberries? Straw free. Raspberries? Do not rasp, or make any noise at all. I could go on.",36,"black. Raspberries? Not raspberry-colored, but a deep red. And don't even get me started on the naming conventions for the various species of wild berries that grow in the forest near our village, like the thimbleberries and the salmonberries, which are actually a pale yellow and a deep orange, respectively."
"He takes out two slices of bread. His forearms are strong, large muscles interrupted by the occasional white scar. “If Were","business is involved, you might not know what you’re looking for. I’ll have you talk with Alex and hand them over to—”",43,"you were to ask the villagers, they would tell you that I'm a man of few words, but the ones I choose to speak are always laced with a hint of truth, and the scars on my arms are a testament to the battles I've fought, both within and without, and the bread I'm slicing is for the stranger who's been wandering these woods for days, searching for a place to call home."
“I can only protect Ana if I know where the threats against her are coming from.” He leans forward across,"the table. The scent of his blood is like a wave lapping at my skin. “I’m not like your father, Misery.”",41,"the table, his eyes locked intensely on the detective's face, his voice low and urgent, as if the fate of the entire operation hung in the balance, and the detective's expression remained impassive, a mask of professionalism that hid the turmoil brewing beneath the surface."
"I know what Vampyres smell like, what their needs and limitations are.",And Ana is not one of us. Which leaves one single other possibility.,25,"and I have studied their behavior, their habits, and their weaknesses, which I have documented in my extensive research on the creatures of the night."
"“I was living in Europe when my mother was injured, but immediately flew back. When it","became obvious that she might not make a recovery, she told me about Ana’s biological father.”",32,"was a matter of hours, I was by her side, holding her hand and trying to process the severity of her condition, which turned out to be a severe concussion from a car accident, and the doctors told us that she would require extensive surgery and a long period of rehabilitation, but thankfully, she made a full recovery, and I was grateful to have been there for her during that difficult time."
"His mouth curves infinitesimally, like he’s tempted to do just that, and I smile, too. Our",eyes hold for a beat before he continues: “Ana doesn’t know who her real father is.”,32,"eyes meet, and for a fleeting moment, we're lost in the unspoken understanding that we've been here before, in this exact same moment, with the same spark of connection that threatens to ignite into something more."
"“Or of a chicken coop, if you ask me.” I","bite my lower lip, mulling it over. “Who is Ana’s father?”",21,"was not the most pressing concern for the eccentric old farmer, who had a penchant for collecting the most peculiar items in his backyard."
"“My mother never told me. My impression is that he already had a family,","and that when she attempted to mention Ana to him, he . . .”",28,"and I was just a distant relative, a cousin or something, but I never really knew him well, and my mother never spoke about him much, which only added to the mystery surrounding his identity and the circumstances of his departure from our family's life, leaving behind only a few scattered memories and a faint sense of longing that I couldn't quite explain."
"“And here I was, thinking we were firmly in the reluctant alliance stage of our marriage.” I don’t mind the supervision. It’s more that Alex appears","to be as good a hacker as I am—the one area in which I allow myself to be competitive. “Okay. Thanks,” I add, a bit sullen.",52,"to be more concerned with the fact that I still haven't unpacked my boxes from the move, and it's been three weeks since we settled into this new place. The way he keeps mentioning it, you'd think I'm some kind of slob who can't even be bothered to put away my clothes, but the truth is, I've been busy with work and haven't had the time or energy to tackle the task. I know he's just trying to help, but his constant reminders are starting to get under my skin, and I'm beginning to feel like I'm being lectured like a child. I'm not sure if it's just me being overly sensitive or if he's genuinely concerned, but either way, I wish he'd just let me handle it on my own terms. Maybe then we could move on to the next stage of our marriage, whatever that may be."
"I’m at the bottom of the stairs when Ana comes racing down the steps, almost crashing into me. Her eyes are full of tears, and my","heart clenches. “Are you okay?” I ask, but she runs past me, straight toward her brother. She’s babbling something about bad dreams and waking up scared.",52,"heart skips a beat as I instinctively reach out to steady her, my hands wrapping around her upper arms to prevent her from falling, and I'm met with a sob that shakes her entire body, the sound echoing through the empty hallway as she buries her face in my chest, her words tumbling out in a jumbled mess of fear and panic, and I'm left trying to make sense of the desperation in her voice, my mind racing with the possibilities of what could have happened to cause her such distress, and I'm torn between trying to comfort her and demanding to know what's wrong, my grip on her arms tightening as I pull her closer, trying to offer what little reassurance I can, but my own anxiety is starting to spike, and I'm not sure if I'm ready to face whatever it is that's got her so upset."

"“As it’s not hemoglobin or peanut based, nothing. So.” I clap my hands. The cicadas quiet, then resume their singing after a disoriented pause. “Tell me if I got it right: You’ll use your meeting with Emery as an excuse to plant some spyware or interceptor that will allow you to monitor her communications","and gain proof that she’s leading the Loyals. But you are going into enemy territory alone, and have the computer skills of an octogenarian Luddite, which puts you at great risk. Actually, no need to tell me if I’m right, I already know. When are you plunging to your imminent death? Tomorrow or Friday?”",108,"and potentially intercept any sensitive information she may share with her colleagues or superiors, thereby gaining leverage over her and the entire organization. The cicadas fall silent once more, their sudden stillness a stark contrast to the cacophony that had filled the air just moments before. I take a deep breath, my mind racing with the implications of what I've just deduced. ""And what's the endgame here?"" I ask, my voice barely above a whisper, as if I'm afraid of shattering the fragile silence that has fallen over the clearing. The figure before me doesn't respond, but instead takes a step closer, its presence seeming to fill the space between us like a dark and foreboding cloud. I can feel the weight of its gaze upon me, and I wonder if I've just made a terrible mistake by pushing this line of questioning. The cicadas, sensing the tension, begin to stir once more, their chirping a nervous accompaniment to the heavy silence that hangs between us."
"I can’t imagine. Or can I? Those first few days after Serena was gone, and I was so frantically preoccupied with",looking for her that it didn’t occur to me to bathe or feed until my head pounded and my body was feverish.,43,"searching for any clue that might lead me to her, that I barely noticed the subtle changes in my own behavior, the way I would involuntarily glance at the clock, the way my mind would wander to the last conversation we had, the way I felt an inexplicable sense of emptiness that seemed to follow me everywhere, like a constant reminder of her absence, and it wasn't until I stumbled upon an old journal of hers, hidden away in a dusty corner of my room, that I began to piece together the fragments of our relationship, and the truth about what really happened that fateful night."
"“It’s just . . .” I’m not sure what’s so concerning about the idea of him seeing them. Maybe I’m just remembering being nine, and the way my Human caregivers always stopped smiling the second I","began. A driver, making the sign of the cross.

Are you looking for an excuse to watch my entrails fertilize the plumbago?”",73,"made eye contact with a stranger, as if I was somehow tainted by the very act of looking at someone who wasn't a part of our little family unit. But now, as an adult, I'm starting to realize that it's not the act of looking that's the issue, but rather the fear of being seen, of being truly understood, and the vulnerability that comes with it. I've always been drawn to the unknown, the unexplained, and the unseen, and the thought of him seeing me, really seeing me, is both exhilarating and terrifying. What if he doesn't like what he sees? What if he tries to change me, to mold me into something I'm not? The what-ifs swirl in my mind like a maelstrom, making it difficult to breathe, to think, to be. But still, I'm drawn to him, like a moth to a flame, helpless to resist the pull of the unknown, the promise of connection, and the thrill of being seen."
"The sharks gnaw at the inner walls of my skull, and I won’t be able to make them stop until I find Serena, but in the","meantime, I can distract them. “Anyway.” I sit up with a smile. “Since I so selflessly opened my heart to you, will you tell me something?”",52,"way of my memories, I see her smile, her laughter, and the way the sunlight danced in her hair, and I am consumed by a sense of desperation, a feeling that I have to find her before it's too late, before the sharks devour what's left of my sanity, and I am left with nothing but the haunting echoes of what could have been, the what-ifs that plague my every waking moment, and the darkness that threatens to consume me whole."
"“No.” He stares at the moonlit water. “When we were young, I was there when Koen’s sister met her mate. We were on a run. She smelled her, suddenly went real still",in the middle of the field. I thought she was having a stroke.” He smiles. “She said that it felt like discovering new colors. Like the rainbow had gained a few stripes.”,64,"and her eyes locked onto him, as if she'd seen something that no one else had. It was as if she'd known, in that instant, that he was the one. I remember the way she smiled, the way her whole face lit up, and the way Koen's eyes sparkled with a mix of excitement and nervousness. We'd been on the run for weeks, hiding from the pack that had been hunting us, and in that moment, it felt like we'd finally found a sense of peace. But little did we know, our troubles were only just beginning."
He nods. “I need to send Emery and her people the message that you’re part,of my pack and no violence against you will be tolerated. Not just the verbal message.”,31,"of the team, and that we're moving forward with the project as planned, but I also need you to discreetly investigate the recent security breaches and find out who's been leaking information to the press."
"Koen is an asshole, in the most delicious and entertaining of ways. He seems","to have distinct preferences, strong opinions, and little interest in keeping either to himself.",28,"to embody the perfect blend of sarcasm and wit, often leaving those around him in a state of bewilderment and amusement, unsure whether to laugh or roll their eyes in exasperation at his outrageous antics and clever comebacks."
