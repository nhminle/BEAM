"Peter said this felt like an invitation. Laughed, almost self-deprecatingly,","as he added, “I’d never believed in fate before that.”",20,"and with a hint of irony, he leaned back in his chair, his eyes never leaving hers, as if daring her to take him up on the challenge."
"My hat landed atop a pile of discarded lo mein, the lip of the can smashed into","my rib cage, and I did a wheezing pratfall into the grass. Peter described this as “adorably clumsy.”",35,"the ground, the contents spilling out in a tangled mess of noodles and sauce, as I stood there, frozen in a moment of"
“I fell in love with Daphne the moment I looked up from,"her hat,” he’d say, no mention of the trash-noodles in my hair.",24,"my book and saw her standing there, her bright smile and sparkling eyes captivating me in a way that I had never experienced before, and as I gazed deeper into her radiant face, I felt my heart skip a beat and my entire world shift in an instant, as if the very fabric of reality had been altered by her presence, and I knew in that moment that I was forever changed, that my life would never be the same without her by my side."
"Over the last three years, Peter dusted off Our Story every chance he got.",I was sure he’d work it into both our vows and his wedding reception speech.,29,"and meticulously polished the old, yellowed pages, searching for any hint of the truth behind the tragic events that had unfolded in the small town of Ravenswood."
“Could you just turn it down?” I say. “All the plates are rattling,in the cabinets and Mr. Dorner’s trying to bust down the living room wall.”,27,"and the noise is making it difficult for me to concentrate on my work, I'm trying to meet a deadline and every little distraction is a setback."
"Petra is also a stoner without a college degree, but I guess it’s different when you’re a perfect",ten with a picturesque family and well-padded bank account. Then you’re not a stoner; you’re a free spirit.,36,"10,000 Instagram followers and your entire life is documented on social media, so it's hard not to take you seriously."
"When I jolted awake at the click of the front door, it was full","bright in the living room, so I could see Peter’s surprise at finding me there.",29,"moonlight that streamed through the window, illuminating the darkened room and casting an eerie glow on the walls, and for a moment, I lay there, disoriented and unsure of what had woken me, the sound of footsteps echoing through the hallway, growing louder with each passing second."
"“No!” he said. “I mean, it wasn’t like that. We’re . . . She told me she’s in","love with me, Daphne. And I realized I am too. In love. With her. Fuck, I’m so sorry.”",36,"in a difficult situation and needed my help, and I agreed to assist her, but I never expected things to escalate like this."
"“Are you fucking kidding me, Peter?” I jumped up. I didn’t",feel hurt then. That would come later. First it was all rage.,23,"think he was serious, but his deadpan expression told me otherwise, and I felt a wave of panic wash over me as I realized he wasn't joking, and I was actually expected to believe what he was saying, which was completely absurd and utterly impossible, and yet, somehow, it made a twisted kind of sense, like a puzzle piece that had been missing all along, and I couldn't shake the feeling that my whole world was about to be turned upside down."
"“Of course she fucking meant for this to happen, Peter! She had twenty-five",years to tell you she was in love with you and chose last night!”,27,"years of experience in the field, and she knew exactly what she was doing when she decided to take on this project, but"
"“I’m really sorry, Daph,” he said, and leaned in to kiss my forehead","like some benevolent father figure, regretfully shipping off for war to do his duty.",27,"but the gesture felt awkward, and I couldn't help but wonder if he was just trying to make me feel better, or if there was something more behind his apology, something he wasn't telling me, something that made him look at me with a mix of guilt and longing in his eyes."
"I stayed there watching the road for probably ten minutes. Then I went back inside and cried so hard it might’ve made me vomit, if I hadn’t completely forgotten to eat the","night before. I wasn’t much of a cook, and besides that, Peter was extremely careful with his diet. Low carbs, high protein. I dug around our understocked cabinets and started making Easy Mac.",65,"breakfast that morning, and my stomach was empty and churning with a mix of emotions, the tears streaming down my face like a river as I collapsed onto the couch, the weight of my grandmother's words still echoing in my mind, and the image of her frail figure standing in the doorway, her eyes filled with a deep sadness and a hint of resignation, replaying over and over like a broken record, each time making me feel like I was reliving the moment all over again, the pain and the grief threatening to consume me whole, and I couldn't help but wonder if I had been foolish to think that I could ever truly escape the past, or if it would always be a part of me, a constant reminder of what I had lost, and what I would never have again."
"Fool that I am, my only guess was that Peter had come back. That he’d made",it to the airport only for a burst of clarity to send him racing home to me.,33,"it was some sort of cruel joke, a prank to play on me after all these years, but as I stood there, frozen in the silence, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that this was more than just a simple trick, and my heart began to pound in my chest as I slowly turned to face the figure standing in the doorway, the one who had been absent for so long, and the one who was now standing before me with a look that was both familiar and yet completely foreign."
"Then Peter and I moved into the Waning Bay house, with its wraparound porch. That day, he scooped me","into his arms, carried me over the threshold, and said three magic words that changed my little minimalist heart forever.",39,"up in his arms and twirled me around, laughing as I squealed with delight, the warm sunlight dancing across our faces, and the salty scent of the ocean carried on the breeze, a sense of freedom and adventure that only the summer months could bring, and as we danced, the old wooden floorboards creaked beneath our feet, the sound echoing through the empty rooms, a symphony of memories waiting to be made, and I felt a sense of belonging, of being exactly where I was meant to be, with the person I loved most in the world, my brother Peter, and as we finally came to a stop, he grinned at me, his eyes sparkling with mischief, and I knew that this was just the beginning of our summer of endless possibility."
"Somehow, the kids manage even more enthusiasm for tacos than they did for dragons. When I ask if they already knew that dragons","love tacos, their shrieks of delight are earsplitting. Arham jumps up, the heels of his sneakers flashing red as he shouts, “Dragons eat people!”",47,"had existed in ancient times, they all nod in unison, their eyes wide with excitement, and one of them blurts out that they had learned about it in a documentary on the History Channel, which they had watched with their parents the night before, and that it was totally true, and that's why they were so into the whole dragon thing, and I couldn't help but chuckle at their infectious energy and the way they were completely sold on the idea of mythical creatures being real, and I found myself wondering if maybe, just maybe, there was some truth to the notion that our modern world was not as different from the past as we often like to think, and that the line between fact and fiction was not always as clear-cut as we make it out to be."
"Just as I predicted, the energy that greeted me has fizzled, the kids mostly settling into pleasant sleepiness in time to pack it in and head home, except","for one of the Fontana triplets, who’s tired enough to devolve into a minor meltdown as her mom is trying to get her and her siblings out the door.",57,"for a few stragglers who lingered by the playground, reluctant to bid farewell to the last remnants of summer freedom, their parents exchanging weary smiles with the staff as they collected their exhausted offspring, the evening sun casting a warm orange glow over the scene, a bittersweet reminder that the long days of summer were slowly coming to a close, and the routine of the school year was just around the corner, waiting to reclaim its hold on their lives."
"Hell, I’m old enough to have a daughter named Renesmee on one of those U-5 soccer teams where","the kids take turns kicking the ball the wrong way, then sitting down midfield to take off their shoes.",37,"the parents are more enthusiastic than the kids, and I still can't help but wonder what the future holds for her, as she navigates the complexities of adolescence and the challenges of being a half-human, half-vampire hybrid in a world where supernatural creatures are not always accepted, and the pressures of being a Cullen are weighing heavily on her young shoulders, as she struggles to find her place in a world where her very existence is a threat to the fragile peace between humans and vampires."
"By the time I climb the stairs and reach the front door, I’m clammy with sweat, and inside I drop my tote and wrestle out of my cardigan before toeing off my loafers. Then I check my phone calendar","against the whiteboard. The only thing that’s changed since last night is, I agreed to host the Thrills and Kills book club on Thursday while Landon, the patron services assistant who usually runs it, recovers from his root canal.",78,"for the day's schedule, my eyes widening at the sight of a meeting I had completely forgotten about, and I let out a deep sigh as I mentally prepare myself for the long day ahead, the fluorescent lights of the office building looming in front of me like a daunting challenge, and I take a moment to collect my thoughts before pushing open the door and stepping into the bustling lobby, where the hum of conversation and the clinking of coffee cups greet me like an unwelcome wake-up call."
"The worst part is, even after all this, I’m not positive I don’t love him. I mean, not this version of him, but the part that remembered every important date,","who brought home flowers just because he happened to be walking past a cart selling them, the Peter who had my favorite soup delivered to me every time I got sick.",61,"remained, the part that cherished every inside joke, the part that still whispered my name in his sleep, the part that I thought I'd lost forever, but somehow, miraculously, still lingered, a ghostly echo of what we used to be, a bittersweet reminder of the love we once shared, a love that refused to die, no matter how hard I tried to let it go."
"“We know how hard this must be for you,” he’s saying, and just like that, he snaps back into the other Peter.","The one I hate. “And I just . . . I hate to think of you there, on your own . . .”",45,"his usual self, the one who's always cracking jokes and making everyone laugh, but there's a hint of genuine concern in his voice, a glimmer of the Peter who's been struggling to come to terms with his own identity."
"I face the window and pantomime a scream, one hand dragging down the side",of my face. I wonder if this exact scenario inspired Edvard Munch’s The Scream.,28,"of my face, the other grasping for the door handle as if I'm desperately trying to escape the"
The weighty silence tells me Peter is doing invisible calculus now. Only he’s got the brain for,it. “You can’t mean . . .” His voice slides past disbelief straight into incredulity. “You’re with Miles?”,35,"it's a talent that has been honed over years of solving complex problems in his head, a skill that has become second nature to him, and one that he often employs when the world around him seems to be moving at a glacial pace, but he's always one step ahead, lost in a world of numbers and equations that only he can see."
I need to get off the phone before I involuntarily spring,"a fictional pregnancy on him. “I’ve got to go, Peter. Take care.”",23,"lose my temper and say something I will regret, but I'm not sure I can just hang up on him now that he's finally"
"“Did you call Peter drunk?” he says, unwrapping his sandwich, flipping","it open, and absolutely slathering the egg and avocado inside with sriracha.",23,"it around in his hands, a mixture of amusement and annoyance on his face, as he takes a big bite."
"Basically, she’s me at twelve years old, if I’d been nine hundred times cooler. Right down to the fact of being the only child of an overworked but lovely single mother with a","penchant for eighties British goth rock. During the school year, Maya walks the short distance from the junior high to the library, and her mom picks her up when she finishes her paralegal shift.",67,"passionate love for 80s rock music and a flair for the dramatic, which she'd inherited from her own mother, a free-spirited artist who'd left a trail of colorful characters and half-finished canvases in her wake. Her mom's constant juggling act of work and single parenthood had left them living in a cozy but cluttered apartment above a vintage clothing store, where the smell of patchouli and incense wafted up through the vents and mingled with the sound of The Cure on repeat. It was a world of thrift store finery and DIY crafts, of late-night pizza and early morning cartoons, of a mom who'd do anything to give her daughter the life she'd never had. And yet, despite the chaos and uncertainty that often reigned, there was a sense of freedom and possibility that permeated every aspect of their little world, a sense that anything could happen if you just believed hard enough."
"The new hardcover fantasy I handpicked for her is the most expensive book on the list, but I can’t bear to cut it. Ordinarily, I talk this kind of thing","over with Harvey, the branch manager, but he left early for his youngest daughter’s med school graduation (the other two are already doctors; he’s apparently created an army of high achievers).",61,"over with my sister, but she's been going through a tough time lately, and I want to make her feel special. The cover art is stunning, and I know she's been a fan of the author's work for years. I remember how she used to devour every book in the series, and I'm hoping this new installment will be just as captivating. I've seen the reviews, and they're all raving about the intricate world-building and complex characters, so I'm crossing my fingers that she'll love it. I've also included a personalized note inside the cover, expressing how much I care about her and how much I hope she enjoys the gift. It's not just a book – it's a gesture of love and support during a difficult time, and I'm willing to splurge on it if it means putting a smile back on her face."
"I personally hate beer. Obviously Petra loves it. She’s a walking fantasy, and",I’m a librarian who actually does wear a lot of buttons and tweed.,26,"her love for beer is just one of the many contradictions that make her so fascinating, and I often find myself wondering what other secrets lie beneath her enigmatic smile, as she effortlessly charms everyone around her with her infectious laughter and captivating presence, making it impossible not to be drawn into her world, even for someone like me who's not a fan of beer."
There is absolutely no way I can go to Chill Coast. Waning Bay,is small enough without me wandering directly into the heart of the Peterverse.,26,"is a place I've always wanted to visit, but the thought of navigating its treacherous roads and unpredictable weather patterns is daunting, to say the least, and I'm not sure I'm ready for the challenge, but perhaps with some careful planning and preparation, I might just find a way to make it happen, and who knows, it could be an adventure of a lifetime."
"“Is that the one with the hot drug-dealer bartender, or the one","down the road from that one, where they only play Tom Petty?”",24,"with the charming but troubled musician, or the one with the enigmatic and beautiful artist, that had captured her heart in the dimly lit streets of the city, where the sounds of the jazz club still lingered in her mind long after the night had faded away."
"I haven’t worn it since, which is stupid, because it cost way",more than I would ordinarily spend (Peter bought it) and it’s extremely flattering.,25,"more than I paid for the entire outfit, but I just can't bring myself to put it on again, the memories associated with it are still too painful to bear, and every time I see it hanging in my closet, it's like a constant reminder of the night that changed everything."
"In my defense, Landon is nineteen years old and nearly always listening to shoegaze in his AirPods at","the decibel of a launching rocket, so it’s not like there have been loads of opportunities to bond.",36,"home, which is why he often misses crucial conversations and appears oblivious to the world around him, but deep down, he's just a sensitive soul trying to escape the harsh realities of life."
"Then again, maybe in five years, he still would’ve left me for Petra. Maybe they’re every bit as destined as he’s","convinced. I’m nauseated by the thought that maybe she belongs there, in that home I’d thought was mine, while I belong nowhere.",43,"as the stars that aligned in the night sky, a celestial map guiding them toward a love that would forever change the course of their lives, and mine, leaving me to ponder the what-ifs that haunted me still, a bittersweet reminder of the love we once shared."
"She nods thoughtfully. “Fair. But for what it’s worth, I’m always late because I have a kid. So I’d like","to think my friends can rely on me, but if it comes down to it, yeah, I choose Mulder every time.”",41,"to schedule my day around their needs, and sometimes that means leaving a bit later than I'd like, but it's worth it to see them happy and thriving, and I'm sure you can understand that, being a parent yourself, you must have experienced similar challenges in balancing work and family life, and it's not always easy to find that perfect balance, but it's something we all strive for, isn't it?"
"“It was terrible!” she agrees. “Every day I’d wake up and have, like, one second of peace. Then I’d remember, Oh, shit, I’m someone’s mom. I was a wreck,","for like six months. But it did convince me to go back to school to become a librarian, and Mulder’s pretty much my best friend, so all worth it.”",58,"and my whole world would come crashing down. I'd think about all the responsibilities, the sleepless nights, the constant worrying, and the endless questions of 'what if.' I'd feel like I was drowning in a sea of motherhood, and I didn't know how to keep my head above water. I'd try to put on a brave face for my family, but inside, I was a mess, struggling to find my identity outside of being a mom. It was like I'd lost myself in the process of becoming a mother, and I didn't know how to find my way back. I felt like I was living someone else's dream, not my own, and it was suffocating me. I'd look at other moms and think, 'How do they do it? How do they seem so put together, so confident, so in control?' And I'd wonder if I was the only one who felt this way, or if everyone else was just pretending to be okay. It was a lonely, isolating feeling, like I was the only one who was struggling to keep up with the demands of motherhood, and it was taking a toll on my mental health. I felt like I was failing, like I was failing myself, my family, and my child. And it was a constant, gnawing fear that I couldn't shake, no matter how hard I tried."
"“Well, I don’t,” I say. “Now there’s no good way to get out of it.","I mean, when we ‘break up,’ Peter will get to feel smug and superior about that.”",31,"since the entire town is already buzzing with the news, and I fear my reputation will be irreparably tarnished if I don't come clean about the whole ordeal."
"“Soulmates?” She laughs. “No. I’m saying your ex is the little boy looking over someone else’s shoulder, trying to figure out if the kid next to him has a better lunch. Only,","the lunch box is shut, so even though he knows what his parents packed for him is pretty good, he’d still trade it just to open up that rusty little Batman lunch box.”",65,"that's not even the worst part – the worst part is that he's still trying to one-up everyone else, even in his own memories, and that's what makes him so toxic and hard to let go of."
"“See, Daphne,” he says, meeting my heckling with over-the-top sobriety, “the Chardonnay grapes themselves are pretty neutral. That’s why they can take on too much oak for a lot","of wine drinkers’ tastes. But ours has a nice peach nose, and this pinch of lemon zest, and a faint, warm oakiness, but not so much that the wine’s overpowered.”",59,"flavor profile, but the key to a great Chardonnay lies in the balance between the fruit and the oak, and that's where the winemaker's skill comes in – a delicate dance of subtlety and restraint, where too much of either can tip the scales and result in a wine that's either overpowering or insipid, and it's a balance that requires a deep understanding of the grape variety, the terroir, and the aging process, as well as a willingness to take risks and push the boundaries of what's considered acceptable in the world of wine."
"“It was bound to happen eventually! Get home safe, lovebirds.” She’s already on her way",back to Greg-Craig. He slips a hand through hers and waves as she steers him outside.,31,"and I'm sure she's relieved to be leaving the chaos of the city behind, the honking horns and endless stream of people, for the peace and quiet of her countryside home, where the only sounds are the chirping birds and rustling leaves."
He manually unlocks the passenger door. “That’s a Get in the,"car, Daphne; I’m not going to dignify that with an answer.”",22,"way you're going, but I'm not sure that's such a good idea, considering the storm outside."
"“Daphne,” he says. “The first piece of advice anyone is going to give you for improving your",situation is going to Big Louie’s. How is it possible you’ve lived here for . . .”,34,"your public speaking skills is to practice in front of a mirror, but I think that's a bit too obvious, and what they don't tell you is that it's not just about mastering the words, but also about conveying the emotions and conviction behind them, and that's where the real challenge lies, because it's not just about speaking, it's about connecting with your audience, and that's what separates the good speakers from the great ones, and that's what I want to teach you, Daphne, to help you become one of the great ones, not just a good speaker, but a master of the art of persuasion."
"“Well, that explains why I’ve never had them,” I say. “Peter",isn’t a big slatherer. He’s more of a wheatgrass-shot-and-lean-meat-after-leg-day kind of guy.”,23,"was always so secretive about his family, and I never thought to pry, but now I'm starting to wonder if there's more to the story than he let on."
"On our second date, he’d made me dinner. Salmon and asparagus and a keto-friendly pasta salad. I would’ve been less impressed to learn he was an Olympian. Cooking was the one thing Mom didn’t do while","I was growing up. We lived on takeout, and weekly nacho nights. But Peter started every day with a green smoothie, and made dinner from scratch most nights. Peak domesticity, as far as I was concerned.",72,"teaching me how to cook, and I'd always felt a little resentful about it, but now I was grateful for her lack of culinary skills, because it meant I'd had to learn for myself, and it was this quiet, unassuming way that he moved around the kitchen, the way he expertly filleted the salmon and steamed the asparagus to perfection, that really caught my attention, and I found myself watching him, mesmerized, as he expertly tossed the pasta salad with a light, effortless touch, the way he moved with a confidence and ease that I'd never seen before, and it was then that I realized, I was falling for him, hard."
"We did. It was one of very few silver linings to our relationship ending that I no longer felt any guilt about not going. Peter was into pretty much every form of physical exercise, but I was slower and less coordinated","than him, so the few times we’d tried hiking or biking, it was more frustrating than rewarding. At the gym, we could do our own things, but still spend time together. With how busy his job kept him, that time was valuable.",83,"than him, and our differing interests had often led to awkward moments during our dates, with him effortlessly completing a marathon while I struggled to finish a 5K. However, it was the emotional toll of our relationship that I had truly struggled with, the constant pressure to keep up with his high expectations and the feeling of inadequacy that came with it. Now, I was finally free to focus on my own passions and interests, and I was excited to explore the world of painting, something I had always been drawn to but never had the time for during our relationship. As I set up my easel in the studio, I felt a sense of liberation wash over me, and I knew that this was just the beginning of a new chapter in my life."
"I stare at him, trying to work out if he actually believes this,",or if he thinks I’m hilariously boring. Maybe Peter thought it was boring too.,27,"or if he's just trying to convince himself, and the desperation in his eyes makes me wonder if he's been living in a world of his own making for far too long."
"“I’m not a huge relationship guy,” he says, a little bashful. “Petra was the exception, not the rule, for me. So","if she wanted to get back together? I don’t know. But it’s not worth thinking about, since she’s engaged to your ex-boyfriend.”",43,"it's not like I'm some kind of hopeless romantic or anything, but there was just something about her that drew me in, something that made me feel like I could be myself around her, without fear of judgment or rejection, and that was a truly liberating experience, one that I'll always treasure, even if it didn't work out in the end."
"As a devoted fan of control, I never had a big weed phase, but annoyingly the voice in my head reminding me",of that isn’t my own; it’s Peter’s. And I don’t want it there. It has no right to keep echoing through my skull.,45,"kept echoing the phrase ""you're not in control"" every time I found myself surrounded by the lush greenery, the smell of damp earth and leaves a constant reminder that there were forces beyond my grasp."
"“That’s what I’m realizing, though,” I tell him, wrapping the sweatshirt more tightly around me. “It wasn’t ever my home. When","you take Peter off the schedule, there isn’t really much left. Waning Bay doesn’t belong to me, like it does to him.”",43,"as I look back, it feels like a series of temporary stops along the way, each one a brief, fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of my life, until I finally found a place that truly felt like home, a place where I could be myself without apology or pretension, where the love and acceptance I so desperately craved were always available to me, and I could finally exhale, finally feel like I belonged."
"Like it was a basketball game, and she and Cooper had decided not to make posters or sit in a specific","section of bleachers. Like things needed to play out, and then someone would simply have won and someone else would have lost.",43,"section of the bleachers, but instead blend in with the rest of the crowd, trying to remain incognito as they waited for the tip-off, their eyes scanning the packed arena for any sign of their friends, who were supposed to meet them there early that morning, but so far had failed to show up, leaving them to wonder if they had gotten the time wrong or if something more serious was amiss."
"But honestly, I didn’t want it to even feel like a choice. I wanted her to know where","she stood. The problem was, she wasn’t my best friend anymore. She and Cooper were our best friends.",36,"that I stood, and that she could see the sincerity in my eyes, the genuine affection that I had for her, and that it wasn't just a fleeting infatuation or a momentary lapse in judgment, but a deep and abiding connection that I had been trying to convey to her for what felt like an eternity, and that I was willing to do whatever it took to make her understand and reciprocate those feelings, even if it meant being vulnerable and open with her in a way that I never had been before."
"And in those days when I was mourning in a puddle, Peter was doing damage control. So","if our breakup wasn’t a basketball game, maybe it was a race, and I was too slow.",34,"it seemed that his diplomatic skills were being put to the test, as he tried to placate the irate customer, who was demanding a full refund for the defective product, while also fielding calls from the marketing team, who were frantically trying to contain the fallout from the social media backlash, and all the while, he had to keep a close eye on the production line, where the quality control team was scrambling to identify the root cause of the problem, and prevent any further damage to the company's reputation."
"“And there’s this girl Maya, who comes in once a week. Twelve or thirteen. Perfect little weirdo. She reads everything—goes through like five books a week. And we have an informal book club, where I pick something out I think she’ll like, and it goes in the","stack, and then she comes back a week later and we just talk about it for an hour while I’m doing admin stuff. She’s supersmart. Has a hard time at school, but you can just tell she’s going to be some great novelist or, like, film director someday.”",95,"library, and we have a discussion about it the following week. She's got this incredible insight, and she asks these questions that make you think, 'Wow, I never thought of it that way.' And it's not just the books, she's got this curiosity about the world, this sense of wonder that's just infectious. Sometimes I find myself getting lost in conversation with her, and before I know it, hours have passed, and the store is closing. Her parents are always grateful, saying how much she's grown since she started coming here, and I have to admit, it's been a joy to watch her develop a love for reading that's just so pure and genuine. But what really gets me is when she asks for recommendations, and she'll say something like, 'I'm looking for something that's not too happy, but not too sad either.' And I'll think, 'Okay, that's a tough one,' but then I'll start thinking about all these books that I've read, and I'll try to find something that fits the bill. It's a challenge, but it's also a reminder that there's still so much to discover, and that's what makes it all worth it."
"I think about the tense call I overheard behind his bedroom door, wonder if","it’s possible he was talking to her, and what Peter would make of that.",28,"it was a desperate cry for help or a heated argument that had escalated into a full-blown confrontation, and whether the person on the other side of the door was someone he had known for years or a stranger who had somehow managed to gain his trust."
"“Okay, not exactly,” I admit. “But it makes me mad that she, like, thinks you need her approval to move on, or something. If she was so in love with Peter, she never should’ve strung you along like that, but","she did, and she dumped you in the worst possible way, and then for her to just insist that you view her kindly—to try to make you not mad, instead of just letting you move on . . . it’s selfish.",81,"now that she's moved on, she's got the nerve to dictate how you should feel and what you should do, like she's still got some claim on you, which is just ridiculous, and honestly, it's not even about her, it's about her mother, who's probably been manipulating her all along, using her guilt and her own hurt to control everyone around her, and it's a toxic cycle that needs to be broken, but it's hard to see that when you're right in the middle of it, and it's even harder to admit when you're the one who's been enabling it, but maybe that's what you need to do, take a step back and look at the situation objectively, and realize that you deserve better than to be treated like this, and that you don't need anyone's approval to move on, not even hers, because you're strong enough to make your own decisions and take care of yourself, and that's what you need to focus on, not on what she thinks or feels, but on what you want and need, and that's freedom, and that's what you should be fighting for, not for her approval or her love, but for your own happiness and well-being, and that's the only way you'll ever truly be able to move on and find peace."

"“Duke was my high school boyfriend,” she says, then pauses to chew for a second. “We broke up when we went to college. Then we both","ended up back here.

But I look at my child, and I know it's all worth it. I'm not just teaching them to be happy, I'm teaching them to be brave, to take risks, and to never settle for anything less than what they deserve.

"Harvey snorts. “I know I’ve got a youthful glow, but I wasn’t born","yesterday. Come in, come in. Shoes off. Everyone’s back in the breakfast nook.”",26,"yesterday, and I've earned the right to look a bit smug about it. After all, I've spent the last two decades"
"I slip my loafers off next to Ashleigh’s knee-high boots and we follow Harvey down a narrow, wood-paneled wall toward the sound of smooth jazz and the potent smell of cigar smoke. Every inch of","the walls is devoted to at least three generations of family photos, ranging from recent shots of his granddaughters’ soccer tournaments all the way back to time-faded wedding portraits of him and his late wife.",70,"the dimly lit hallway seemed to whisper secrets of the past, the soft hum of the jazz and the sweet scent of smoke transporting us to a bygone era, where the air was thick with the weight of forgotten memories and the flickering candles cast eerie shadows on the walls, making it seem as though the very spirits of the past were watching us as we descended deeper into the heart of the mysterious mansion, the sound of laughter and hushed conversations growing louder with each step, until we finally reached a grand ballroom, where the patrons were dressed to the nines, sipping champagne and dancing to the sultry rhythms of the jazz band, their faces a blur of smiles and laughter, as we made our way through the crowd, searching for a glimpse of the enigmatic host, Harvey, who seemed to be leading us on a wild goose chase through the winding corridors of his opulent estate."
"Harvey moves out of the hallway, so we can slide into the breakfast nook after him.","“Look who decided to finally show up,” he says, “and she brought us a new fifth!”",32,"and take our seats at the small table, where the morning sunlight streaming through the window casts a warm glow on the worn wooden surface, and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafts up to greet us."
They’re both wearing the same visors as when I met them. Both have matching cigars hanging out of their,mouths. Lenore yanks hers out from between her lips as she stands to greet me. “What a nice surprise!”,38,"mouths, and their sunglasses seem to be reflecting the same confident glint in their eyes, as if they're still the same individuals I met years ago, but now with a hint of weariness etched on their faces, a testament to the weight of time and experience."
"He puts the pitcher back in the fridge. “Go put on something nice,",Daphne. We have to leave soon.” He squeezes past me to leave the kitchen.,27,"and I'll start cooking dinner, maybe some pasta with a light sauce, and we can have a quiet evening at home, just the two of us."
"And when I’m done telling him about the fundraiser, I find myself talking about the kids, about the staff, about our desperate need for an updated stock of kid lit,","and by the end of our conversation, Lance has not only pledged ten kite-building sets for prizes but also offered to host a miniature-painting class for us in the fall.",60,"and before I know it, he's scribbling down notes on a napkin, his eyes lighting up with a spark of enthusiasm that I hadn't seen in a long time, and I'm left wondering if maybe, just maybe, this could be the break we've been waiting for, the key to unlocking the funds we so desperately need to bring our little library into the 21st century, and I'm filled with a sense of hope that I hadn't felt in months, a sense that maybe, just maybe, we can make a real difference in the lives of these kids, and I'm grateful for this chance encounter, this chance to reconnect with someone who truly understands the importance of what we do, and I'm excited to see where this newfound partnership might take us, and I'm already thinking about all the possibilities, all the ways we can work together to make a real impact, and I'm eager to get started, to see the look on the kids' faces when we finally get that new stock of books, and I'm smiling to myself as I walk out of the coffee shop, feeling more optimistic than I have in a long time, and I'm already looking forward to our next meeting, to seeing where this new partnership will take us."
"Slow, soft, familiar. A relief of a kiss, and over way, way too soon, though from the way","Petra is gawking at us, you’d think we’d just performed a handstanding sixty-nine in front of God and everyone.",37,"it seemed, the gentle pressure lingered, a fleeting moment of connection that left her breathless and wanting more, yet the sound of his voice, low and husky, cut through the silence, a stark reminder that their time together was limited, and the weight of their secrets hung precariously in the air, threatening to shatter the fragile peace that had settled between them."
"“She always thought I was reading too much into it,” he says. “But",I think they were worried I couldn’t give Petra everything they want for her.”,27,"it was precisely that tendency to read between the lines, to see the unseen, that had led him to uncover the dark secrets hidden beneath the surface of their seemingly idyllic relationship."
"Every night that week, we cook together—or Miles cooks, while Jules sits on the counter, curating a country playlist and singing along at top volume","into whatever utensil her brother has most recently set down. I chop whatever he puts in front of me, wash whichever dishes he’s done with.",50,"to the point where Miles has to beg her to turn it down, but she just laughs and says it's the only way to get the dishes done without losing our minds, and the music swirls around us like a warm, golden light, filling the kitchen with a sense of joy and contentment that we both know is a rare and precious thing, especially after the long, hard days we've been having, and as we work together, the tension between us begins to ease, and we start to feel like ourselves again, like the people we were before the world outside our little bubble started to get so crazy."
"“Daphne,” he murmurs behind me, still tender and sweet, pulling me in,","my back to his chest, and coiling his arms around my waist.",24,"closer to him, his warm breath dancing across the nape of my neck, sending shivers down my spine as he whispers a single word that makes my heart skip a beat: ""mine."""
"His smile widens. His fingers move absently to my chin, and I feel myself being drawn into","him, our stomachs connecting, his heart pattering through me. “It’s a camel, Daphne,” he says wryly. “In sunglasses.”",35,"the depths of his eyes, where a warmth and a light seem to emanate, and for a moment, I forget about the world around us, and all that exists is the gentle pressure of his fingers and the soft, husky sound of his voice as he whispers my name."
She groans. “A week from Saturday. Forty-three. And no to big plans. It just so happens to fall on the weekend Mulder and I get back from,"visiting my mom in Sedona, so he’ll be at his dad’s place, and I’ll be at home rotting my brain to the tune of Bravo reality TV.”",54,"our trip to the cabin in the woods, and I was thinking we could just relax and unwind after being cooped up in the car for so long, but Mulder's been acting strange lately, and I'm starting to get a little worried about what he might have planned, maybe something to do with the X-Files case we've been working on, or perhaps something more personal, I'm not sure, but I do know that I'm not looking forward to whatever it is, especially since it's going to be a big milestone birthday for him, and I want it to be special, but I'm not sure if I'm ready for whatever he has in store for me."
"“Like a room,” I say. “In your house. You said Duke never wanted you to, right? And you’re","tired of looking at the same four walls. So pick a wall color, and I’ll come help paint.”",36,"still living there, but it's not the same, is it? The walls seem to close in on you, and the shadows on the floor appear to twist into faces that whisper your name, reminding you of the secrets you keep, and the ones you've tried to forget, but can't shake off the feeling that Duke's presence still lingers, a constant reminder of what you've lost, and what you've gained, but at what cost, and the weight of it all is crushing you, making it hard to breathe, to think, to live, and you wonder if you'll ever be able to escape the prison you've built for yourself, or if you'll be trapped forever, reliving the memories, the pain, the heartache, the what-ifs, and the if-onlys, and the more you try to move on, the more you feel like you're stuck in this never-ending cycle, reliving the past, and the future seems uncertain, and the present is a blur, and you're not sure which way is up, or down, or forward, or back, and you're lost, so lost, in a world that's moving on without you, and you're left behind, wondering if you'll ever find your way back to the surface, or if you'll be forever trapped in this dark, damp, and dusty room, with only your thoughts to keep you company, and the echoes of Duke's voice, whispering in your ear, reminding you of what you've lost, and what you'll never have again."
"There isn’t much else in the room. A bed, a dresser, a side table. I wonder whether",Duke took most of the furniture with him. There’s a sadness to this space that I didn’t expect.,35,"he had been a man of simple tastes, or if the sparse furnishings were a reflection of his troubled past, a past that he had left behind in the chaos of his departure, and was now trying to escape in this isolated place."
