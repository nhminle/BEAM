The expression he makes is like the meme of that one kid who smiles and then immediately bursts into tears.,West is staring at me like he’s doomed but must pretend to be happy about it. “Anna.

"“I knew what Jake ordered for lunch and what kinds of stupid movies would make him laugh, and I could predict all his pickup lines","at parties, but we didn’t ever, like, sit down and do backstory.

"“I definitely need to go back to the beginning,” I say, wiping my eyes. I mime an explosion at my temples. “Like—my mind is blown right now. You dressed like a middle schooler around the house.

And don't even get me started on the fact that you used to eat Cheetos for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I'm starting to think that you're not as high maintenance as I thought, and that's kind of a relief. But at the same time, it's also kind of weird to think that the person I'm dating is secretly a total nerd who loves video games and comic books. I'm not sure how to process all of this new information, but I'm definitely intrigued. I want to know more about this side of you, West. Can you tell me more about your childhood and how you went from being a total tomboy to the sophisticated man I know today?"

"He looks me over again, top to bottom, and the defeat in his eyes makes me realize the true extent of my unshowered, feral chaos. “Actually,","Anna,” he says, “I need you to come with me to my sister’s wedding in Indonesia and convincingly play the part of my very loving wife.”","it's not just the state of your appearance that's the problem, but the desperation that's been written all over your face, the weight of",52,"it's not just the state of your appearance that's the problem, but the desperation that's been written all over your face, the weight of your exhaustion, and the faint scent of defeat that clings to you like a shroud, a constant reminder of the struggles you've been facing, and the ones that lie ahead, and for a moment, I'm not sure if I'm looking at a person or a shadow of what you once were, a shadow that's been worn down by the relentless pounding of life, and I'm not sure if I can help you find your way back, or if you're beyond saving, but I have to try, because that's what people do, we try, we reach out, we offer a hand, a lifeline, a glimmer of hope in the darkness, and I take a step forward, my voice barely above a whisper, ""Let's start with something simple, shall we?"""
"It’s surreal to be here with her after all this time. I was so close to being done with this, so near to the finish line, yet here I am, having to improvise an intricate plan B at the eleventh hour with a Muppet in human form as my co-conspirator. Don’t get me wrong, beneath the baked, unshowered disarray, Anna is still a beautiful woman, with enormous brown eyes, creamy skin, and long, willowy limbs. I’d always been fascinated with the perfect beauty mark just above her lip. Unfortunately, right now she looks like","she’s fallen out of a tree and crawled through a field of tangly briers to get back to her apartment. This is probably the closest I’ve ever seen to her natural hair color because the pink has grown out a good inch, leaving a stripe of brown at her roots.

I take a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of unease that's been growing inside me since I arrived here. We need to get out of this place, and fast, before it's too late. I glance around the room, taking in the familiar surroundings, the old furniture, the faded curtains, and the worn-out carpet. It's a place I've been to many times before, but never under these circumstances. I turn back to Anna, who's watching me with a mixture of fear and desperation in her eyes. ""Okay, let's get down to business,"" I say, trying to sound calmer than I feel. ""We need to come up with a plan, and fast. We can't stay here any longer."" Anna nods, her eyes never leaving mine, and I can see the wheels turning in her head as she tries to come up with a solution. I take a step closer to her, my heart pounding in my chest.

"As roommates, we didn’t know each other well—that much is probably obvious—but there is an intimacy to sharing a space with someone, a certain kind of kinship that comes with daily proximity. Anna was reasonably tidy and paid her half of the rent when it was due, but she’d never struck me as the organized, driven, premed type.

I found myself wondering if there was more to Anna than met the eye, and I couldn't help but feel a twinge of curiosity about what lay beneath her carefree facade. Our conversations began to take on a new dynamic, with me probing her about her interests and hobbies, and her revealing glimpses of a more complex personality. It was a slow-burning fire, but I could sense that our friendship was on the verge of a transformation, one that would reveal new depths and dimensions to our relationship."

"“Okay, okay. I’m on my way.” Slinging her purse over my shoulder and collecting our carry-ons, I make my way to the ladies’ room, where","Anna peeks out into the hallway.

Her eyes go round. “The fam—” Anna shakes her head. “You know what? Never mind. Of,"course you have a plane.” Straightening, she asks, “So, why was I in Cambodia? Photography? Fabric design?”","course, I've heard the stories about the old mansion on the hill, but I never thought I'd be the one to stumble",33,"course, I've heard the stories about the old mansion on the hill, but I never thought I'd be the one to stumble upon it, especially not on a night like this, with the wind howling and the trees creaking ominously in the darkness, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching out to snatch at my clothes as I make my way up the overgrown path, the moon hidden behind a veil of thick, grey clouds that seem to be watching me, waiting to see if I'll dare to take another step forward, and I can feel the weight of history bearing down upon me, the whispers of the past echoing through the empty halls, a chill running down my spine as I push open the creaking front door and step inside, the musty smell of decay and rot filling my nostrils, and I know I'm not alone, that I'm being watched, and I try to call out, but my voice is caught in my throat, unable to escape, and I'm frozen in place, my heart pounding in my chest, as I wait for whatever is lurking in the shadows to make its move."
"Once, when we were roommates, Anna flew to Seattle with a friend. It had been her first time on an airplane, and she struggled so much navigating the travel website that she brought me her laptop at midnight and asked for help. I finished the transaction for her, prebooked the car","to the airport, and then quietly tracked the ride the day she left to make sure she got there okay. When she got home, she made a point of thanking me for the help. Apparently, the trip itself was fine, but the highlight for her had been flying on an airplane.","rental, and even helped her download the necessary travel documents on her phone, but what struck me most was her wide-eyed wonder as she gazed out the airplane window at the clouds below, her voice filled with a mix of excitement and trepidation as she asked me",102,"rental, and even helped her download the necessary travel documents on her phone, but what struck me most was her wide-eyed wonder as she gazed out the airplane window at the clouds below, her voice filled with a mix of excitement and trepidation as she asked me if the plane would really take off into the sky. I remember the way the city lights twinkled like diamonds as we soared higher, and the gentle hum of the engines as we pierced through the clouds, leaving the world behind. It was a moment of pure innocence, a snapshot of a time when the world was full of possibilities and the unknown was a thrilling adventure. As we landed safely in Seattle, Anna turned to me with a beaming smile, her eyes sparkling with a sense of accomplishment, and I knew in that moment that this was just the beginning of her journey, one that would take her to places I could hardly imagine, and I felt a sense of pride and responsibility, knowing that I had played a small part in helping her take that first step into the unknown."

So, let's be real, if you're not getting at least seven hours of sleep a night, you're not doing yourself any favors. It's time to make a change, to prioritize your sleep and take care of your body.
