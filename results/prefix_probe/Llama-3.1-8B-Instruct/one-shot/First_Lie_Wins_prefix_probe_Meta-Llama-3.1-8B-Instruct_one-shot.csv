"It may be the first time I’m meeting the people gathered around the table, people who Ryan has known since childhood, but it hasn’t escaped anyone’s attention that I’m already fully embedded in his life. It’s the small touches","a woman brings to a man’s home, like the matching throw pillows on the couch or the faint whiff of jasmine from the diffuser on the bookshelf, that every other woman notices the second she walks through the front door.",79,"that have made it impossible to ignore, from the way I laugh at his jokes to the way he instinctively reaches for my hand when we're walking down the street. They've seen the way he looks at me, with a love and adoration that's hard to miss, and they've welcomed me into their lives with open arms, making me feel like I've been a part of their family for years. It's a feeling that's both exhilarating and terrifying, as I'm still getting used to this new life with Ryan, and the idea of being a part of his past and present is a daunting one, but one that I'm eager to explore further."
The smile on Ryan’s face tells me he knows how I feel about being asked,"this and he’ll step in again to answer for me, but I shake him off.",30,"to be part of this project, but I'm not sure if he's aware of the extent to which I've been struggling to come to terms with the implications of our research findings and the potential consequences of our discovery."
"Ryan would have given them more than they deserve, and that’s why I stopped him. I don’t mention it was at the truck stop on the outskirts of town where I worked in the","small restaurant bar making sure no drink went empty. And I don’t mention that while they are familiar with lots of acronyms from MBA to MRS, the only one I’m acquainted with is GED.",68,"summer of '95, the smell of diesel fuel and worn leather still lingering in my nostrils as I recall the sound of Ryan's voice, his words hanging in the air like a challenge, a test of my resolve to do what was right, even when it meant going against the grain of our small community's expectations, where loyalty and tradition often took precedence over justice and fairness, and I knew that if I let him give them more, it would set a precedent, one that would be difficult to undo, and I couldn't shake the feeling that it was only a matter of time before they came back, their hands outstretched, expecting more, and I wasn't sure I could keep saying no, not without consequences, not without losing myself in the process."
"I told Ryan I was afraid of how they would judge me once they found out my background was so different from theirs. He assured me he didn’t care what they thought, but he does. The fact that he caved","and invited them all here and spent the week helping me get the menu just right tells me more than the whispers in the dark that he likes how different I am, different from the girls he grew up with.",80,"that he caved to his parents' wishes and asked me to keep my past a secret, made me realize that he wasn't as accepting as he claimed to be. It was a painful reminder that no matter how much he professed to love me, his family's expectations and social status still held more weight in his eyes. I couldn't help but wonder if he was just pretending to be the person I thought he was, or if he was genuinely struggling to reconcile his love for me with the pressure to conform to his family's ideals. The more I thought about it, the more I felt like I was living a lie, and the more I questioned whether our relationship was built on a foundation of truth or just a fragile web of deceit."
I watch Ryan. I’ve whittled down our entire meeting to one,"sentence, and so far, he’s let me get away with it.",22,"of a single, piercing glance, and I can see the faintest glimmer of a doubt flickering in his eyes, a doubt that I am determined to fan into a flame."
"I smile and laugh, not too loud and not too long, to show that I,","too, am amused at the thought that Ryan would go to such extremes to meet me.",31,"am not entirely serious, but also not entirely insincere, in order to maintain a delicate balance between my true feelings and the social expectations of the situation."
"“I totally nailed it,” I say, as I dip the last dinner plate into the sink full of soapy water. Ryan moves in behind me, his arms skimming my hips","until they are wrapped around my waist. His chin settles on my shoulder, and his lips press against that spot on my neck in a way he knows I adore.",60,"and his chest brushing against my back, sending a shiver down my spine. The warm water and the scent of dish soap envelop me, and for a moment, I forget about the chaos of the day. We've just finished cooking dinner together, and the kitchen is spotless, a testament to our teamwork. Ryan's hands wrap around my waist, pulling me closer as he leans in to kiss my neck, his breath sending a flutter through my chest. I feel a sense of contentment wash over me, a feeling that's been missing for a while now. It's been a long day, but in this moment, everything feels right with the world. The tension between us is palpable, and I can feel the anticipation building as Ryan's lips graze my skin, sending a spark of electricity through my body. I turn to face him, our eyes locking in a moment of understanding, and I know that this is what I've been craving – connection, intimacy, and a sense of belonging."
"Ever since Ryan asked me to move in with him five days ago and I said yes, he’s been impatient for it to happen. I woke up","the morning after the dinner party to him on the phone with a moving company, scheduling their services for later that day, thanks to a last-minute cancellation.",54,"to find him pacing back and forth in the living room, his eyes fixed on the clock on the wall, as if willing the hours to pass faster, and I couldn't help but wonder if he was as excited as I was about starting this new chapter in our lives together, or if there was something else driving his eagerness, something he wasn't telling me, and I felt a flutter in my chest as I thought about the possibility of us finally being able to live together, to wake up every morning in the same bed, to share our daily routines and our deepest secrets, and I couldn't wait to find out what the future held for us, but at the same time, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was rushing into something without thinking it through, that I was leaving behind the comfort and security of my own space, and I wondered if I was making a huge mistake, but the thought of being with Ryan was too enticing to resist, and so I pushed those doubts aside and focused on the excitement of what was to come, and as I got out of bed and began to get ready for the day, I caught him watching me, a look of adoration in his eyes, and I felt my heart skip a beat as I realized that I was exactly where I was meant to be."
"Ryan looks down at the tie, straightening it even though it’s already straight but needing something","to do. He hasn’t touched me this morning and barely looked at me. Yep, total baby.",32,"to fill the awkward silence that has fallen between them, a silence that seems to be growing thicker by the second as they stand there in the dimly lit office, the only sound the soft hum of the air conditioning unit in the background."
"Twenty minutes after Ryan’s Tahoe pulls out of the driveway, I’m doing the same in my ten-year-old 4Runner. Lake Forbing is a medium-size town in north Louisiana that is known for its fertile farmlands and deep pockets of natural gas. There","is a lot of money in this area, but it’s the quiet kind. It takes fifteen minutes to get to Lake View Apartments from Ryan’s house, and from what I can tell it’s nowhere near the lake this town was named after.",83,"has a population of around 12,000 residents, with a mix of old and new homes, some dating back to the early 19th century, while others are modern developments that have sprouted up in recent years. As I drive down the main street, I notice the old town hall, a beautiful example of colonial architecture, with its white columns and large porch, which seems to be the centerpiece of the town's historic district. The streets are lined with quaint shops and restaurants, each one unique and full of character, giving Lake Forbing a charming small-town feel that is hard to find in larger cities. I make my way to the outskirts of town, where the landscape shifts from urban to rural, with fields of cotton and soybeans stretching as far as the eye can see. The air is thick with the sweet scent of blooming magnolias, and the sound of birds chirping fills the air, creating a sense of peace and tranquility that is a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of city life. As I continue driving, I notice a sign that reads ""Welcome to Forbing Farms,"" and I wonder what kind of operation it is and what kind of people live and work there. I make a mental note to stop by and ask some questions when I get a chance."
Pat follows me up the stairs while his helper opens the back of the large box truck.,"Stopping in front of the door, I pull a key out of my bag. “This is me.”",34,"and carefully begins to unload the heavy furniture, the sound of creaking wood and scraping metal filling the crisp morning air as the sun rises over the quiet suburban street."
"I eye the first stack of boxes, each filled with the items I’ve spent the last four days picking out. Things Pat has been storing for me in that box truck",until I was ready for him to bring them here. Things that I will move to Ryan’s house on Saturday. Things I will say I’ve owned for years rather than days.,62,"are now neatly stacked in the garage, a testament to the patience and generosity of my brother, who has been more than willing to lend a helping hand, and I must admit, it's a relief to finally have everything organized and out of the way, the boxes labeled and color-coded, a system that Pat insisted on, but one that I'm grateful for now as I begin to unpack and settle into this new chapter of my life."
"In the kitchen area, I unzip the black bag and remove four menus from nearby restaurants and three pictures I printed from the kiosk at CVS of Ryan and me, plus seven magnets to hold each item in place on the refrigerator. Next, I grab the assortment of condiments and pour half of each one down the sink drain before lining them in the door of the refrigerator. Moving to the bathroom, black bag in tow, I pull out the shampoo and conditioner then pour half of each down the drain like I did with the condiments, before putting the bottles on the edge of","the tub. Unwrapping a bar of Lever 2000 soap, I set it on top of the drain in the sink and turn the water on, rotating it every few minutes until the logo is gone and the edges are dulled, then drop it into the small built-in space on the shower wall. Toothpaste is last. Starting from the bottom, I squeeze a portion out but leave a glob or two on the rim of the sink, just like I do at Ryan’s house, even though I know he’ll fuss about it. Leaving the cap off, I drop the tube on the counter near the faucet.",210,"the bathtub, where I carefully place the remaining items from the black bag, including the hair dryer, a single hair tie, and a used tissue, making sure not to leave any fingerprints or other signs of disturbance. I then proceed to the bedroom, where I take out the clothes from the dresser and closet, scattering them across the floor in a seemingly random manner, before moving on to the nightstand, where I empty the drawers and toss the contents onto the bed. The black bag is now almost empty, but I still have a few more items to dispose of. I take out the phone charger and the laptop, and plug them in, making sure they are fully charged before I leave them on the nightstand. Next, I grab the trash can and empty its contents into the black bag, which is now almost full. I take a step back to survey the chaos I've created, making sure everything looks as if it was done by a burglar in a hurry. Satisfied with the mess, I take one last look around the room, making sure I haven't missed anything, before grabbing the black bag and making my way out of the house, leaving behind a trail of destruction and confusion. The plan is to make it look like a robbery gone wrong, and I'm confident that I've done a good job. But as I walk out the door, I can't shake the feeling that I've left something behind, something that could blow the whole thing wide open. I quicken my pace, my heart racing with anticipation, as I make my way back to the safe house, where I'll be waiting for the signal to make my next move."
"I slide my hands into my front pockets and lean back against the wall next to the kitchen counter, crossing one ankle in front of the other. My movements are slow but calculated. It worries me she’s here, checking on me, and that she’ll feel the same","need to do so on Saturday, when Ryan is here moving me out. I picked a place where neighbors don’t bother to get to know one another, and the rent includes utilities since units can be leased by the week. And one week was all I needed.",94,"way I do, like I'm some fragile, breakable thing that needs constant supervision. I've been doing this for years, perfecting the art of appearing weak, of letting people think I'm not as capable as I am. But it's all just a facade, a mask I wear to hide the truth: that I'm stronger than anyone gives me credit for, that I've been holding it together for so long, and that I'm not going to let her see the real me, not yet, not ever."
"It must have piqued her interest when I rented one of the few unfurnished units. Usually if someone goes to the trouble of moving furniture in, they plan on staying longer than seven days, but I didn’t want Ryan to think my","life was so transient that I didn’t even have my own couch so the furnished unit wasn’t an option. And here we are on day four and there’s nothing to show for my stay except eight boxes, strategically placed around the room.",84,"stay was anything more than a temporary arrangement, so I deliberately chose a place that would give me the freedom to come and go as I pleased. The landlord, a gruff but kind old man named Joe, seemed to understand my situation and didn't ask too many questions, which suited me just fine. As I signed the lease and handed over the first month's rent, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over me, a feeling that I hadn't experienced in a long time. It was a new beginning, a fresh start, and I was determined to make the most of it, even if it meant keeping my past a secret from the people around me, including Ryan."
"She clucks her tongue against the roof of her mouth, then turns to leave. It takes everything in me not to throw the bolt closed","behind her. But I’m almost finished here, and there’s still more to be done before Ryan crosses the Louisiana state line at five thirty this afternoon.",51,"behind her, but I'm not sure I can trust myself to be that civil, not after the way she's been treating me lately, with her condescending smile and her knowing glances, like she's the only one who truly understands what's going on, and I'm just a foolish, lovesick fool, blinded by my own emotions, but still, I manage to keep my cool, and I follow her out of the room, trying to keep up with her long strides, my heart pounding in my chest, as I wonder what she wants from me, and why she's being so secretive, and what's really going on behind those piercing green eyes of hers."
"From the way Ryan tells it, one day he dropped by to check on his grandfather, only to find he had died peacefully in his sleep, and then a week later Ryan was moving in.","The only possessions he brought with him were his clothes, toiletries, and a new mattress for the bedroom. Ryan probably would have made room for an ugly second-hand couch . . . if I had one.",71,"and it was as if the old man had been waiting for him all along, his belongings neatly packed and a small note on the kitchen table with a single sentence that read: ""Welcome home, Ryan, I've been expecting you."" The house, though quiet and still, felt strangely alive, as if the grandfather's spirit lingered, watching over Ryan as he began to settle into his new life, a life that was both familiar and yet utterly foreign, a life that would challenge everything Ryan thought he knew about himself and his family's past."
"But it’s too big for Ryan. It’s two stories with a wide front porch and big backyard, white with dark green shutters, manicured flower beds, and a brick path that leads to the front",door. It would take several minutes to walk through if you needed to check every room—big enough that someone could come in the carport door and you wouldn’t hear it from the main bedroom.,68,"door, which is painted a warm, honey-colored wood that complements the surrounding foliage perfectly, and a large oak tree stands tall in the corner of the yard, its branches stretching towards the sky like nature's own cathedral, providing a sense of serenity and tranquility that is hard to find in today's fast-paced world, and as Ryan steps out of the car and onto the driveway, he can't help but feel a sense of awe at the sheer size and beauty of the house, which seems to be a perfect blend of old and new, with its classic architecture and modern amenities, and he can't wait to explore every nook and cranny of this new home, to discover all its secrets and surprises, and to make it his own."
They are silent spectators as I unload box after box. Ryan is pulling into the driveway just as I,grab the last one. He jogs over the second he’s out of his car to relieve me of it.,38,"am finishing up the last of the boxes, the afternoon sunlight casting a warm glow over the entire scene, and for a moment, I feel a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment wash over me as I watch Ryan step out of the car, a mixture of curiosity and exhaustion etched on his face, and I wonder what he'll think of the new furniture and decorations I've been working on for weeks, the smell of fresh paint and sawdust still lingering in the air, and I take a deep breath, preparing myself for the inevitable questions and comments that will follow, as he makes his way towards me, a smile spreading across his face, and I can tell he's trying to contain his excitement, but I can see the wheels turning in his head, already thinking of all the ways he can rearrange and redecorate, and I smile to myself, knowing that this is just the beginning of a new chapter in our lives, one that I'm eager to explore and create together."
"Mrs. Rogers stands up and walks to the edge of the porch, putting her as close as",she can get without falling into her azalea bushes. “Y’all look busy over there!” she hollers back.,34,"possible to the railing, her eyes scanning the darkness beyond the faint moonlight that filters through the trees, her voice barely above a whisper as she says, ""I've seen things in this town that would make your blood run cold, things that can't be explained by reason or science, and I'm starting to think that we're not alone here, that there's something lurking just beyond the edge of our perception, watching us, waiting for its moment to strike."""
Ryan laughs. “It’s been a while since I’ve had one of your Old Fashioneds. I’m looking forward,to it.” Then he knocks his shoulder lightly against mine to get me moving toward the house.,34,"to savoring the complex blend of flavors and aromas that only a well-crafted cocktail can provide, especially one made with your signature blend of bitters and smoked cherries."
Ryan is always tight lipped about what he does on Thursdays. And while,"he joked this morning about skipping work today, we both know he never would.",27,"it is understandable that he prefers to keep his personal life private, but the curiosity of those around him only seems to intensify with each passing week, fueling speculation and gossip that often spreads like wildfire through the small community."
Ryan follows me back to the apartment in his Tahoe. I’m glad I’m not in the car with him when,"he realizes where we’re going, but at least the idea that I was embarrassed about where I live rings true.",40,"he's driving erratically, weaving in and out of lanes, his anger and frustration palpable in the tense grip he has on the steering wheel, the sound of the tires screeching as he takes a sharp turn, making me hold on to the door handle for dear life."
"The lock gives a bit easier this time, and the second the door swings open Ryan has us inside and the door shut behind us. He paces the apartment with","his hands on his hips. I hate to admit I like his growling prowl of the room, and the protective instinct vibrating through him is as foreign as it is welcome.",61,"his eyes scanning every nook and cranny, his hand resting on the grip of his gun, as if he's waiting for something - or someone - to make a move, the tension in the air palpable, the silence between us thick and heavy, like a challenge, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest, my senses on high alert, wondering what we've gotten ourselves into, and what Ryan's plan is, as he stops pacing and turns to face us, his expression unreadable, his eyes locked on mine, and I can see the faintest glimmer of something there, something that looks almost like a warning, or a plea, or maybe even a promise, but I'm not sure what to make of it, and I'm not sure I want to know."
"Ryan moves to the counter and picks up the closest perfume bottle. Holding it up, he inspects it from","top to bottom, then does the same to the other three lined up next to it. “Do you collect these?”",39,"every angle, the sunlight catches the intricate design on the glass, and for a moment, he is transported back to his childhood summers spent at his grandparents' old mansion, where his grandmother would lovingly collect and display such exquisite bottles, each one telling a story of its own."
"There is no mention that his mother collects perfume bottles as well, or the fact that I have something in common with her, and I won’t analyze how it makes me feel that he doesn’t let me know this is something we share. Ryan sets the bottle back down and begins opening drawers in the kitchen and then staring at the fridge. He plucks off one of the pictures","of us and studies it. It’s a selfie we took not long after we met. It was cold outside and we’re both bundled up in front of the small fire pit in his backyard. I had brought over ingredients to make s’mores and we had bits of marshmallow and chocolate on our faces. In the picture, I am sitting in his lap and we are smiling big, cheek to cheek.",139,"from the fridge and holds it up, studying it intently, his eyes scanning the faded Polaroid of the two of them standing in front of a beachside bonfire, the sun setting behind them, casting a warm orange glow over the scene. I remember that day vividly, the smell of saltwater and s'mores, the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. It's a memory I've tried to hold onto, but it's been years since we've spoken, and I'm not sure if he remembers it as fondly as I do. He looks up, his eyes locking onto mine, and for a moment, I think I see a glimmer of recognition, but it's quickly replaced by a mask of indifference. I feel a pang of disappointment, but I push it aside, trying to focus on the present moment. Ryan sets the picture back down and continues to rummage through the fridge, pulling out a container of leftovers and a bottle of ketchup. He begins to make himself a sandwich, his movements economical and practiced, a testament to the fact that he's been living here for a while. I watch him, feeling a sense of unease growing inside me, unsure of what to make of this strange, awkward encounter. The silence between us is thick and heavy, and I'm not sure how to break it. I clear my throat, trying to speak, but the words catch in my throat, and I'm left standing there, feeling like a stranger in my own home."
"I hear him gathering the containers, then opening the cabinet under the sink where the trash can hides. He dumps them on top of some take-out boxes and other items","I found in one of the outdoor trash containers. Ryan pulls the can out and says, “Anything else need to go in here before I take it to the dumpster?”",60,"and the clatter echoes through the kitchen, a stark contrast to the silence that had filled the room just moments before. The smell of last night's Chinese food wafts up, mingling with the scent of fresh garbage, creating an unpleasant aroma that hangs in the air. He pauses for a moment, surveying the mess he's created, before beginning to sort through the items, separating the recyclables from the trash, a task he's done countless times before, but one that still seems to weigh on him, a reminder of the mundane routine that has become his life."
I’m late for lunch with the girls. Sara and I texted back and forth over the course of the last few days trying to find a day that,"worked for everyone, and while adding me to their group message would have saved a lot of time, it will take more than one dinner party for that invitation.",57,"worked for everyone, and we finally settled on today. I'm looking forward to catching up and hearing about what's been going on in their lives. We always have so much fun together, laughing and gossiping about everything from our jobs to our love lives. I'm a bit nervous about what they might say about my recent breakup, but I'm trying to be positive and focus on the good times. As I walk into the restaurant, I see them already seated at a table by the window, sipping their drinks and chatting animatedly. I take a deep breath, put on a smile, and make my way over to join them."
"While I might be willing to be interrogated by the women Ryan considers friends, I’m not opening myself up to",anyone else. Not yet. Not until I’m sure I know more about them than they will ever know about me.,40,"to the scrutiny of the entire school, especially not to the whispers and gossip that would inevitably spread like wildfire through the hallways, fueled by the malicious intentions of those who would seek to tear me down rather than lift me up."
"It’s a little awkward that the reason we’ve never met was because she wasn’t invited to Ryan’s for dinner, but that was his call. He tossed her name around but ultimately","decided to exclude her because, as he put it, sometimes she can get on his “ever last fucking nerve.” Plus, she’s single and that threw off the numbers at the table.",62,"decided not to extend the invitation, citing some vague excuse about needing a smaller gathering, which was a bit suspicious given that there were only five of us in total, and she was the only one left out."
"Just as I’m stashing my purse on the floor by my chair, I feel",the vibration of an incoming text. A quick glance tells me it’s from Ryan:,28,"start to notice a faint scratching noise coming from the old wooden floorboards beneath my feet, and I wonder if it's just the house settling or something more unusual."
Ryan leans against the open door of the small workroom in the basement of the gallery.,"Lunch ended less than two hours ago, so I’m impressed with how fast word got to him.",33,"where the smell of oil paint and turpentine still lingered, a faint echo of the countless masterpieces that had been brought to life within its walls over the years, and gazes out into the dimly lit hallway, his eyes fixed on the figure of his sister, Emily, who stood frozen in the doorway, her expression a mixture of concern and curiosity."
"“But you shouldn’t have to handle that.” His hand reaches for mine, then he’s pulling me into his lap. I glance at the open door, hoping no one","catches us like this. I’ve only had this job a couple of weeks, and everyone knows I only got it as a favor to Ryan and nothing more.",56,"will see us, but the hallway is empty, and the only sound is the soft hum of the air conditioning. He wraps his arms around me, holding me close as I try to squirm free, but he's too strong. I feel a rush of panic as he pulls me tighter, his breath hot against my ear, and I wonder if I should be scared or if this is what I've been waiting for."
"Ryan wraps an arm around me, anchoring me to him. His finger traces the top","edge of my thin tee. “This is killing me right now, just so you know.”",30,"of my spine, sending shivers down my body as he pulls me closer, his warm breath dancing against my ear, whispering words that only I can hear, and for a moment, everything else fades away, leaving only the two of us, suspended in this intimate, electric connection."
The muffled sound of his phone vibrating has him checking his watch to see who’s calling. Ryan groans as he stands up from his chair,"and digs his device out of his back pocket. “Give me a second,” he says as he steps into the hall to answer the call.",50,"and walks over to the kitchen counter, where his phone is sitting, the screen lighting up with an incoming call from an unknown number. He hesitates for a moment, wondering who it could be, before finally answering, his voice low and cautious as he says, ""Hello?"" The person on the other end remains silent, and Ryan's grip on the phone tightens, his mind racing with possibilities, from a wrong number to a telemarketer, but something about the silence sends a shiver down his spine, making him feel like he's being watched, and he can't shake the feeling that this call is more than just a coincidence."
“Anything else come up?” he asks. His shoulders stiffen while he listens to whoever is on the other line. I’m prepared for the glance Ryan gives me over his shoulder and all he sees is my attention firmly on the seating chart in front of me. Then,"he takes one step farther away from me. The pitch of his voice drops lower. I can’t make out the words, but he’s clearly unhappy and letting it be known. He’s all but growling into the phone. This is not a side of him I have seen before.",95,"he turns back to the phone, his expression unreadable, and responds in a low, even tone, ""I understand, I'll take care of it."" The line goes dead, and he sets the receiver back in its cradle, his eyes scanning the room once more before finally meeting mine, a hint of a question in his gaze, as if searching for reassurance that I've got everything under control, that I'm ready for whatever is about to unfold."
“About the same.” Ryan gives me one last kiss then gets up. He’s almost,"to the door when he adds, “You know you can tell me anything, right?”",28,"to leave, but not before he turns around and says, ""I'll be back for you, and next time, it won't just be a visit."" The words hang in the air as he walks out the door, leaving me feeling both relieved and anxious about what the future holds."
"She’s picking apart my story, looking for the truth behind my words. And from my research, she’s good at what she does. Something","isn’t sitting right with her, and she’s trying to decide if digging into my background is worth the possibility of losing Ryan’s friendship.",46,"it seems she's been doing this for a long time, with a keen eye for detail and a mind that can piece together even the smallest fragments of information, which is why I'm starting to feel a sense of unease as she asks her next question, her eyes locked intensely on mine, searching for any sign of deception, any hint that I might be hiding something from her."
"Ryan turns the SUV onto a long gravel road, passing an open ornate gate with the words hidden hills farm in",metal letters stretched out across the top. He spares me a quick glance. “Yours won’t even be the biggest hat there.”,42,"the faded letters, the trees lining the road casting long shadows in the fading light of day, the crunch of gravel beneath the tires a stark contrast to the smooth asphalt they had left behind, as Ryan navigated the winding path that led to a secluded farmhouse, its windows glowing warmly in the evening darkness."
"Moving in with Ryan has upped his romance game: simple touches, sweet words and gestures, going out of his way to make sure I’m happy. When he’s not at work, we’re together. I can tell from his one-sided conversations with","his friends that they are not pleased that I am monopolizing his time. A good girlfriend would insist he see his friends, make sure he didn’t lose touch with the people he’s closest to—but I am not a good girlfriend.",80,"his phone, that he's been talking to someone, but he's always quick to reassure me that it's just a friend or family member, and I try to believe him, but the nagging feeling persists, a constant reminder that I'm not the only one in his life, and it's a feeling that's hard to shake off, especially when I see the way he looks at me, with a mix of love and guilt, like he's torn between two worlds, and I'm not sure which one he's more committed to, me or the mystery woman on the other end of the line."
"We surf the crowd and Ryan speaks to almost every person we pass, introducing",me to them as his girlfriend while his arm anchors me to his side.,28,"himself with a warm smile and a firm handshake, exchanging stories and laughter with the locals, who seem to know him by name and reputation, and"
"Before long, she wanders off to deliver more hugs, and Ryan gets into a deep conversation with a local judge about an upcoming election, so I take a moment to look around. This place is beautiful. The winding driveway was long enough that you can’t see the main road or hear any traffic from the house, making it feel like this party is hidden from the rest of the world—just as its name suggests. The red","wooden barn sits on top of a hill and the pasture slopes down in all directions around it like a sea of green lined with white fences. There is a large movie theater–size screen attached to the side of the barn, while smaller screens are scattered in between white linen tables that will show the race. Servers roam the crowd bearing silver trays of mini Hot Browns, individual portions of cheese grits, and delicate tea sandwiches.",152,"The red brick façade of the mansion seems to blend seamlessly into the lush greenery surrounding it, giving the impression of a tranquil oasis in the midst of chaos. As I take a deep breath, I notice the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the soft chirping of birds, which only adds to the serene atmosphere. The sound of laughter and gentle chatter carries through the air, mingling with the clinking of glasses and the occasional clinking of ice in a glass, creating a soothing melody that seems to lull the world into a peaceful slumber. I feel a sense of calm wash over me as I take in the beauty of this secluded haven, and for a moment, I forget about the stresses of everyday life. The trees, adorned with twinkling fairy lights, sway gently in the breeze, casting dappled shadows on the ground below, creating an enchanting ambiance that is both magical and inviting. As I continue to take in the sights and sounds, I notice a group of people gathered around a large stone fireplace, their faces aglow with warmth and camaraderie, and I feel a pang of longing to be a part of their circle, to be enveloped in the sense of belonging that seems to radiate from them."
“Ryan!” the man says while flinging his arm around Ryan’s neck and pulling him in tight. The two hug it out while I study the woman,"with him. She’s tall, close to my height, with long light-brown hair. She’s slender but muscular, and I can’t help but notice how physically similar we are.",53,"standing beside them, her eyes fixed on the scene with a mixture of amusement and curiosity, her long, curly brown hair bouncing with each subtle movement as she smiles at the reunion, her bright blue eyes sparkling with warmth, and I notice the way her smile seems to falter for a brief moment before she regains her composure, her gaze drifting towards me with a hint of a question, as if asking if I'm okay with this display of affection, and I nod almost imperceptibly, trying not to intrude on their moment, but my eyes can't help but linger on the way Ryan's face lights up with joy as he hugs his friend, the tension between us momentarily forgotten in the face of their reunion."
"I place my hand in his and he shakes it enthusiastically. James is tall and thin, with the look of someone who struggles with substances. It’s in the hollow places in his cheeks and the smudge of dark under his eyes. The tremor in his hands and the clothes that are a tad too big. Nice dress clothes","he probably dug out from the back of some closet just for today. His companion looks to be in better shape, and not just her clothes but her general well-being. Her dress is a cream sleeveless shift that hits midthigh, the shoes are Italian and expensive, and the jewelry is simple but classy. They are a mismatched pair.",116,"for a man who can't afford them, but he's trying to make a good impression. His smile is wide and genuine, but it doesn't quite reach his eyes, which seem to hold a deep sadness. As we walk towards the conference room, I notice the way he glances around the office, taking in the sleek furniture and the bustling atmosphere. He looks out of place, but he's trying to fit in. I wonder what brought him here, and what he's hoping to achieve. His grip on my hand tightens slightly as we approach the conference table, where a group of people are already seated, sipping their coffee and chatting quietly. James clears his throat to get their attention, and I can feel his nervous energy radiating towards me."
"Ryan and I share a look. It’s not like we’re engaged, so this hearty congratulations seems a bit much. “Thanks,” Ryan says as he wraps",his arm around me. We both look at the woman standing next to him and Ryan nods in her direction. “Introduce us to your friend.”,50,"his arms around me, a gesture that's more of a reflex than a genuine display of affection, and I force a smile onto my face, trying not to think about the fact that we've only been dating for a few weeks and this is the first time we've met his family, and I'm starting to feel like I'm in way over my head, but Ryan's mom is beaming at us with a warmth that's almost palpable, and she's already asking us when we're planning on getting married, and I'm trying to play it cool, but my mind is racing with all the things that could go wrong, and I'm wondering if I've made a huge mistake by coming here, but Ryan's squeezing my hand reassuringly, and I take a deep breath and try to focus on the present moment, and the fact that we're surrounded by people who care about us, and the sound of laughter and chatter fills the air, and for a moment, everything feels almost normal, but I know that's just an illusion, and the reality is that I'm still trying to figure out if I'm ready for this, and if I'm ready for Ryan, and the thought sends a shiver down my spine, and I'm not sure if it's excitement or fear, but I'm determined to face it head-on, and see where this journey takes us."
"She notices my inspection and does one of her own. I feel her stare, as it starts at my feet and runs straight",up to the big ridiculous hat. Is she surprised by how much we resemble each other? “Have you been to Eden?” she asks.,46,"up to my face, lingering for a moment on the faint scar above my left eyebrow, before moving to my eyes, where it seems to bore into my very soul, as if searching for secrets I've kept hidden for far too long."
"“Hey, honey! Who won the game?” Mama asks from her bedroom. My light-brown hair is free of the wig cap and",my face is scrubbed clean of makeup. The black hoodie has been replaced with one depicting my high school’s name and mascot.,43,"is now loose and messy, and I'm sitting on the couch, staring blankly at the TV screen, trying to remember the score, but my mind keeps wandering back to the argument we had with Dad earlier that day, and how it's been a while since we've all been in the same room together, and I wonder if anyone even cares about the game anymore, or if it's just a distraction from the tension that's been building up in our household lately."
"“One day soon you’ll be all grown.” She lets out a laugh and adds, “What am I saying, you’re already there. Taking care of me and everything else. I want so much for you,",Lucca. A home and a family of your own one day. I want you to have that house we’ve always dreamed of. Maybe you can build it in that fancy new neighborhood near the lake.”,69,"to be happy and fulfilled, to find your own path in life, and to never lose sight of your dreams, just like you've never lost sight of mine. I'm so proud of the person you've become, and I know that no matter where life takes you, you'll always be strong and capable of overcoming any obstacle that comes your way. Your father would be proud too, if he were here to see you now."
"I head straight for the tiny room at the front of our trailer that is nothing more than a large closet, but it’s like stepping into another world when I pass through the door. Before cancer ravaged her body, Mama spent every day in this room behind her sewing machine and craft table. Mothers came from all over North Carolina to have her make","pageant dresses, prom dresses, and even the occasional wedding dress for their daughters. When I was little, I’d sit at Mama’s feet and watch these plain girls walk in and then somehow be transformed once she got her hands on them. It was in that moment that I learned you can become someone else with the right hair, the right dress, and the right accessories.",129,"their children's clothes, and she'd lovingly stitch together quilts that would be passed down through generations. The smell of fabric and thread still lingers in the air, transporting me back to a time when life was simpler, and Mama's laughter echoed through these narrow walls. I run my fingers over the old sewing machine, feeling the familiar grooves and scratches that tell the story of countless hours spent creating something beautiful from nothing. The craft table, cluttered with threads, buttons, and scraps of fabric, seems frozen in time, as if Mama might return at any moment to pick up where she left off. I take a deep breath, letting the memories wash over me, and begin to sort through the remnants of her craft, searching for a glimpse of the woman she used to be, before the cancer took its toll. As I dig through the boxes and baskets, I find a small, intricately stitched quilt, its edges frayed and worn, but still radiating a warmth that seems to emanate from within. It's a quilt I remember from my childhood, one that Mama made for me when I was just a little girl, and I'm overcome with emotion as I hold it close, feeling the love and care that went into every stitch. I sit down at the craft table, surrounded by the remnants of Mama's craft, and begin to work on a new project, trying to recapture the essence of the woman who once filled this tiny room with laughter and love."
"When Mama first got sick, I took over her orders. I’d been helping her in this room for as long as I can remember, so it wasn’t a big leap. But pageant",dresses and custom-made costume jewelry didn’t bring in enough money to get Mama the treatments she needed or pay for all the medication she was on. So I had to get creative.,64,"after pageant practice was a different story. I had to learn how to give her medication on time, manage her pain, and even do her hair and makeup when she couldn't do it herself. It was a lot to take on, but I was determined to take care of her like she had always taken care of me. I remember the first time I had to give her an injection, my hands were shaking so much that I had to take a few deep breaths before I could do it. But with each passing day, I became more confident in my abilities, and Mama grew weaker, but her spirit remained strong. She would tell me stories about her own mother, who had passed away when she was just a teenager, and how she had taken care of her younger siblings on her own. Those stories inspired me to be strong for her, and I knew that I had to be there for her, no matter what."
Ryan is scanning the crowd for a sign of me when I leave the bathroom. He’s still in the same,"place I left him, probably thinking that it would make it easier for me to find him if he stayed put.",41,"position, standing near the bar, nursing a drink and looking every bit as out of place as I feel, his eyes scanning the room with a mixture of concern and frustration, his gaze lingering on the entrance for what feels like an eternity, his eyes finally locking onto mine as I make my way back through the crowd, a hint of relief washing over his face as he takes a step forward, his eyes never leaving mine, his expression softening into a warm smile as I approach him."
"Ryan pulls me close the second I reach him, his arm",sliding around my waist. “Are you okay?” he asks. “You look pale.”,23,"wraps tightly around my waist, his warm breath on my neck sending shivers down my spine as he whispers something in my ear that makes my heart skip a beat."
He seems relieved that my predicament has an easy remedy and pulls me to the buffet table and loads a plate of food for me. Ryan,"finds two open spots at a white-linen-covered table and sets the plate between us. “If you don’t feel better after eating some of this, we can leave.”",53,"starts to explain the situation to the host, who is a jovial man with a bushy mustache, and they both begin to discuss the intricacies of the catering service, while I take a seat at the table, feeling a mix of gratitude and embarrassment at the sudden display of kindness, and try to make sense of the unfamiliar surroundings, the soft hum of conversation and clinking glasses creating a sense of warmth and community, as Ryan continues to chat with the host, his words flowing easily, and I find myself drawn into the conversation, my initial wariness giving way to a sense of belonging, as the host offers me a warm smile and a plate of food, and I take a bite, the flavors exploding on my tongue, a welcome respite from the uncertainty that had been plaguing me just moments before."
"Once everyone is settled, Beth leans in and says, “I would be so pissed if I showed up wearing the same hat as three other women here.” She must be talking",about the one with the peacock feathers shooting out of the top and falling like a curtain down the back until they almost touch the ground. I’ve seen three of those already.,63,"about the infamous hat incident at the office party last year, where five employees, including the CEO's wife, all wore the same designer hat, causing a major fashion faux pas and a heated debate about who had the right to wear it first."
"But now that it seems like James and the woman are gone, I’m ready to leave too.","The sooner I can get out of here, the sooner I can figure out what is going on.",35,"and I've been waiting for what feels like an eternity for this moment, the freedom to start anew, to escape the memories that still linger in every corner of this place, to find solace in the unknown, and to rediscover myself, away from the shadows of their complicated past."
"“Lucca,” he says, and that single word punctures my lungs, making it hard to drag in a breath. My hand on the","steering wheel grips tight, and it’s the only thing that stops this car from flying off the road and landing in the ditch.",45,"of the door handle feels cold and slick with sweat as I stare at him, my mind racing with the memories of our past, the what-ifs, and the unspoken words that have hung between us like a challenge, a test of wills that I've been trying to avoid for far too long."
"Before my brain can come up with any words, he says, “That girl with James.” His eyes are",still closed so he doesn’t witness my silent hysteria. “She said something weird after you went to the bathroom.”,37,"glazed over, and his voice is low and steady, but there's a hint of a tremble beneath the surface, as if he's trying to keep his emotions in check, and I wonder what's really going on behind those piercing blue eyes that seem to see right through me."
"“Just before they walked away, she said James was hoping to reconnect with me but",said it so he wouldn’t hear her. Said she’d love to get to know you too.”,31,"it had been years since they last spoke, and he wanted to rekindle their old friendship, but I wasn't so sure if I was ready to let go of the past and forgive him for his past mistakes, and the way he had hurt me, and the memories of our complicated history still lingered in my mind, making it difficult for me to trust him again."
"“The last time I saw him, things were . . . strained. I’ve learned to be cautious","where James is concerned,” he says with a grumble. “She seems nice enough, though. Too good for him.”",35,"around people, especially those with a history of manipulation, and I've come to realize that trust must be earned, not assumed."
"Matt flips a pen and catches it, over and over, while he studies me. “I","have to say, we’ve been impressed at the places you’ve gotten in and out of.”",30,"am not sure what to make of your sudden interest in me, but I suppose it's flattering, in a strange sort of way, and I find myself wondering what you're thinking as you watch me so intently, your eyes never leaving mine, your expression a mask of curiosity and something else, something that looks almost like concern, but I'm not sure I believe that, not yet, not when I've only just met you."
He gives me a smirk as if he thinks I’m cute. His phone chimes and he slides it,"off his desk. Matt’s thumbs move across the screen at an amazing speed, his attention firmly on his phone.",37,"silently into his pocket, his eyes never leaving mine, and I feel a flutter in my chest as he leans in closer, his voice low and husky as he says, ""I think you're even more beautiful when you're angry."""
"Matt rests his elbows on the arm of his chair and kicks his feet up on his desk, the phone forgotten for a moment. “You’d be doing what you’re good at. We’ll drop you in a situation",and you’ll get us what we need. Without anyone being the wiser. You won’t believe the difference it will make with us behind you. I’ll give you the details as soon as you tell me you’re in.”,74,"that requires your unique set of skills, and you'll be able to navigate it with ease, leveraging your expertise to achieve the desired outcome. Your ability to think on your feet and adapt to new situations will be invaluable in this role, and we're confident that you'll excel in this environment. We've seen you handle complex problems with finesse and poise, and we're eager to see you take on this new challenge. The team will be working closely with you to ensure a smooth transition, and we're committed to providing you with all the necessary resources and support to ensure your success. With your skills and our guidance, we're confident that you'll be able to make a significant impact and drive results. So, what do you say? Are you ready to take on this new opportunity and see where it takes you?"
"My mind splits, showing two different paths; this is definitely a crossroads moment. Taking the job Matt offers moves me deeper into this world but comes with the support that would make the feel of those cuffs biting into","my wrists a distant memory. The other path requires me to go straight. To get out before I’m in any real trouble. Because as Saturday night proved, it will only be a matter of time before something else goes wrong.",79,"my wrists a little more bearable. On the other hand, turning it down means I'll have to rely on my own resources, which, although uncertain, might allow me to maintain a semblance of control and freedom. The thought of being tied to this world, even if it's a safer option, sends a shiver down my spine, while the prospect of going it alone fills me with a mix of trepidation and determination. I take a deep breath, weighing the pros and cons, trying to make a decision that will have far-reaching consequences for my future, and perhaps, my very soul."
There was even a picture of James and her at the Derby party in the “People and Places” section of,the tiny local newspaper; her hat was looking even more dainty and refined in print than it did in real life.,41,"the local newspaper, which had been taken by a well-known photographer who had been hired to capture the glamorous atmosphere of the event, and it showed them laughing and smiling together, with James's arm casually draped over her shoulder, as if they were the happiest couple in the world, and the caption below read ""Love is in the air at the Derby"" and it was a moment that would be remembered for years to come, a moment that would change the course of their lives forever."
He heads inside and I sit back and stare at the sky. It’s been a few days since I spied on him at the warehouse and the mailbox is still empty. There was,"another sighting of James and that woman last night. According to social media, they were at a local craft brewery listening to a popular local band. They have hit every hot spot in town.",67,"no sign of the mysterious package he was expecting, and I couldn't help but wonder if I had imagined the whole thing, but the memory of his anxious expression still lingered in my mind, a nagging feeling that something was off, and I found myself glancing at the clock for what felt like the hundredth time that day, the minutes ticking by at a glacial pace as I waited for some sign, any sign, that he was back, but the silence was oppressive, a heavy blanket that suffocated me, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was running out of time."
"Greg opens the door immediately, as if he has been waiting for me to arrive. He’s wearing a gray suit with a darker gray tie,","and his hair looks like it hasn’t changed since he was a young boy. Short and combed to the side, not a strand out of place.",51,"and his hair is perfectly combed, giving off an air of confidence that makes me feel slightly intimidated. He steps aside, allowing me to enter the room, and I notice the faint scent of his cologne lingering in the air. The interior of the office is sleek and modern, with a large wooden desk in the center of the room, behind which sits a woman with a stern expression, who introduces herself as his assistant, Ms. Thompson."
He nods and gestures for me to come inside. He checks his watch for the second time since,"he’s opened the door, then yells toward the wraparound stairs that curve up the foyer wall. “Jenny! She’s here!”",37,"we entered the old mansion, and I wonder if he's as anxious as I am to get this over with, the ticking clock in the hallway seeming to mock our every move as we make our way to the study, the heavy wooden door creaking ominously as he pushes it open, revealing a room that's been frozen in time, the air thick with the scent of old books and stale air, and I can feel his eyes on me, waiting for me to make the first move, but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do next, or what he expects me to find."
"“Right, okay, I’ve got to get to the office,” Greg says, then turns to me. “You are in charge of Miles. His schedule is written out and taped",to the fridge; my number is on the bottom. He can give you a tour of the house and show you where everything is. I’ll be home by six.”,57,"on the fridge, but I'm sure he'll be fine. Just make sure he eats his lunch and doesn't get into any trouble. I'll be back by five, and we can discuss the Johnson project then. In the meantime, if you need anything, just give me a call. Oh, and don't forget to remind him about his piano lesson this afternoon. His teacher is coming over at three, and I don't want him to forget. I've also left a list of emergency contact numbers on the counter, just in case. And, of course, if anything urgent comes up, don't hesitate to reach out to me or my assistant. I'll be in meetings all day, but I'll check my phone periodically. Let's keep this under wraps for now, okay? I don't want the rest of the team to know that I'm leaving early. It's just a routine check-up, but I'd rather not draw attention to it. I'll see you later, and let's keep this between us, deal?"
I open drawers and rummage through every part of the room. It’s big enough that there’s a sitting area tucked in a corner near,"the door that leads to the bathroom. Inching into that space, I stay perfectly quiet while I listen to Jenny sing off-key in the tub.",49,"the window, with a small desk and a single chair, and a large bookshelf that stretches all the way up to the ceiling, filled with dusty tomes and forgotten trinkets, but I still can't find anything that seems out of place or suspicious, and I'm starting to feel a sense of unease, as if I'm missing something obvious, and the more I search, the more I realize that I don't even know what I'm looking for, or why I'm looking for it in the first place."
"Staring at the ten-number keypad, I start to sweat. There are a lot of things I can do, but",cracking safes is not one of them. I pull out the phone that Matt gave me for emergencies only.,38,"but none of them seem as daunting as the task at hand, which is to enter the correct code to unlock the safe that holds the key to my family's long-lost treasure, a secret that has been hidden for generations, and one that I am not even sure I am ready to uncover, but the thrill of the challenge is too great to resist, and I take a deep breath and begin to dial the numbers, my heart racing with anticipation as I wonder what secrets lie ahead."
"I pull the edge of the foil back to peek. “Oh yum, these",smell divine.” I’m already visualizing the Facebook post Mrs. Bernard has probably already uploaded.,27,"look absolutely delicious, but I'm a bit worried that they might be overcooked, the aroma is a bit too strong for my liking, and I hope they're not burnt underneath, I'll just take a small bite to check, mmm, the flavors are amazing, but I think I'll need to adjust the seasoning a bit, maybe add some more herbs and spices to balance it out, and I'll also make sure to check the internal temperature to ensure they're cooked to perfection."
"“Hello,” he says, as he turns the pages in his notebook. “I’m Deputy Bullock. I’m gathering",as much information as I can. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?”,32,"information about the recent string of burglaries in the area, and I was wondering if you might be able to provide me with some insight or any information that could aid in the investigation. I've been reviewing the security footage from the last few nights, and I noticed that you were seen walking near the scene of the most recent burglary, which is why I'm here to ask you a few questions."
"It’s taken me three months, but now Andrew Marshall turns to me for my reaction on anything from which tie to wear to whether he",should attend a certain event. A nod or quick shake of my head is all it takes to blow someone else’s carefully made plans for him.,51,"he should take the bus or drive to work, and I've grown accustomed to his constant questioning, but today he asks me something that catches me off guard, his eyes sparkling with a mix of curiosity and mischief as he says, ""Do you think I should finally get a pet, something to keep me company in the evenings when you're not around?"""
"The next time there’s a knock on the door, I know what to expect. A bellhop, not the uniformed George, pushes a luggage cart into the room then unloads three large boxes. I tip him and off","he goes. I get the monitors set up and hook up the laptop, logging into the site on the paper I received earlier. The screen fills with small blocks, showing every angle of Andrew’s room and balcony.",74,"hand him the room key, and he disappears as quickly as he appeared, leaving me to the task of unpacking the boxes. The first one contains a stack of crisp, white shirts, neatly folded and arranged by color, while the second is filled with a variety of ties, each one carefully wrapped in tissue paper. The third box, however, is a mystery – it's wrapped in brown paper and twine, with a small, handwritten note attached that reads: ""For your eyes only."" I frown, wondering who could have sent such a cryptic message, and what could be inside."
"Every man I invited to Andrew’s private cocktail party jumped at the invitation. I was very particular with my list, choosing men from all over the South, since this was a regional conference and not just one for","South Carolina. And since all my jobs from the last two years have taken place in the South, I’m up to date on the political climate in each state, including the good and bad on every big name here.",77,"the entire country, and I wanted to make sure that the attendees were familiar with the local culture and customs. The guest list included a mix of politicians, business leaders, and influential figures from various industries, all of whom were known for their charisma and ability to engage in stimulating conversations. As the night of the party approached, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation, wondering who would arrive early, who would bring their significant others, and who would be the life of the party. The venue was a luxurious mansion on the outskirts of town, with a sprawling garden and a private pool, providing the perfect backdrop for a sophisticated evening of networking and socializing. I had hired a team of professional bartenders and caterers to ensure that the drinks and food were top-notch, and the music playlist was carefully curated to appeal to a wide range of tastes. As the guests began to arrive, I made my way around the room, greeting each person with a warm smile and a firm handshake, making sure that everyone felt welcome and at ease. The atmosphere was electric, with laughter and conversation flowing freely, and I couldn't help but feel proud of the effort I had put into creating this unforgettable night."
"Like Andrew, there are a handful of lawyers attending who also hold a range of elected positions, from local government office to the Senate. But I only invited","the bad boys looking to play. The same ones who will quote the Bible along with their great love of family, faith, and God at their next rally.",56,"know a few of them personally, and I must say that their presence here today is a testament to the enduring influence of Andrew's legacy in the legal community. Many of them have spoken highly of his commitment to public service and his unwavering dedication to upholding the principles of justice. As I look around the room, I am reminded of the countless lives that Andrew touched during his time in office, and the countless more that he will continue to inspire through his memory. His impact will be felt for generations to come, and it is an honor to be a part of this celebration of his life and work."
"Pulling out my phone, I open Instagram. I have zero posts and a handful of followers who are mostly bots, but I follow Devon’s bogus account plus forty-seven others, 90 percent of them businesses or famous personalities that post every day. Out of the forty-seven accounts my bogus account follows, thirty-two of them are also followed","by Devon’s. And even though I posted my comment on Southern Living’s latest post letting him know I needed to meet up with him tonight at five, he will answer me in a comment on a completely different account so no one would be able to link our comments as communication between the two of us.",112,"by Devon's account, which is no surprise, given that he's been trying to build his online presence for months. I scroll through my feed, but there's nothing new or interesting, just the usual spam and promotional posts from the businesses I follow. I'm about to close the app when I see a notification from Devon's account, a direct message that reads ""Hey, what's up?"" I hesitate for a moment, wondering if I should respond, but my curiosity gets the better of me. I type out a quick reply, trying to sound casual, and hit send before I can change my mind. As I wait for a response, I start to wonder what Devon wants to talk about, and whether it's something I should be worried about."
Devon’s shoulders shuffle back and forth a couple of times as if he’s trying,"to determine how he feels about this subject. “First, we know anything is possible, right?”",29,"to shake off the weight of his thoughts, but the frown on his face remains stubbornly in place, a testament to the turmoil brewing inside him."
"“Miss Porter,” he says as his hands rest on the low-slung gun belt around his waist.",“I’m going to need you to come to the station with me to answer a few questions.”,33,"“I've been thinking, ma'am, that it's high time we got to the bottom of this business with the missing cattle, and I reckon you might be the only one who can help me figure out what's going on around here.”"
"I take my time driving from Hilton Head back to Raleigh, North Carolina, with the last twelve","hours heavy on my mind. I shouldn’t care what Andrew Marshall thinks about me now, but I do.",35,"hours of daylight still lingering in the sky, the sun casting a warm orange glow over the endless stretch of asphalt and pine trees that line the highway, the rhythmic hum of the engine a soothing accompaniment to my thoughts as I reflect on the events of the past few days, the memories of the beach and the ocean still fresh in my mind, the sound of the waves and the cries of the seagulls echoing in my ears, the salty scent of the sea air still lingering on my skin, and the feeling of freedom that comes with the open road stretching out before me like an endless possibility, the miles flying by in a blur as I drive, lost in thought, the world outside my window a kaleidoscope of colors and sounds, a never-ending tapestry of beauty and wonder, the world a vast and mysterious place, full of secrets and surprises, and I feel small yet connected to it all, a tiny thread in the intricate web of humanity, connected to everyone and everything, and yet, at the same time, completely alone, a solitary figure on the open road, with nothing but my thoughts to keep me company, the miles ticking by, the sun dipping lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the road, and I know that I have a long way to go before I reach my destination, but for now, I am content to simply be, to let the road unfold before me like a map, to follow its twists and turns, to see where it takes me, and to enjoy the journey, no matter where it may lead."
“And I’m to believe you walked away from the weekend with absolutely nothing on Marshall? That you in fact have,not uncovered a single thing in all the time you’ve been with him that can be used as leverage against him?”,41,"no evidence of any romantic involvement, no mementos, no photographs, no nothing, not even a lingering scent of perfume or cologne that might suggest a fleeting encounter, and yet you expect me to believe that you managed to resist the charms of the infamous Marshall, a man known for his charisma and good looks, a man who has a reputation for leaving a trail of broken hearts in his wake?"
"In order to walk out of there today, I had to agree to meet with the detectives in Atlanta on Friday morning to answer questions on the circumstances surrounding the death of Amy Holder. If I refused to agree to do that, I would be","held at the Lake Forbing Police Department until the escort sent by the Atlanta Police Department arrived and dragged me back there. If I’m not there for that meeting on Friday morning, there will be another warrant issued for my arrest for failure to show.",90,"be arrested and held in custody until further notice, which would undoubtedly cause a media frenzy and put my family through an even more difficult time, not to mention the potential damage to my reputation and career. The detectives seemed genuinely concerned about the case, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that they were also trying to intimidate me into cooperating. I had to remind myself that I had done nothing wrong and that I had the right to remain silent, but the weight of their words still lingered in my mind as I walked out of the police station, the bright sunlight a stark contrast to the darkness that had just unfolded inside."
"It’s a picture of me taken on the same day, but the location is different.",I’m leaving a bank a few blocks away from the hotel Amy was staying in.,30,"and the time is also off by a few hours, which is why my smile seems slightly forced and my eyes appear to be gazing off into the distance, lost in thought."
"“And you are now underestimating me,” he sneers. “I have the video surveillance from the security cameras inside the Wells Fargo branch on Peachtree Street. You rented the box before the Fire Department had fully doused the flames engulfing Amy Holder’s body. You never","keep anything important on you, and this would have been the quickest and closest place to safely stash what you retrieved. The only reason we’re even having this conversation is because I don’t know the box number, nor do I have the signature card details.”",89,"never intended to harm her, but the insurance policy was a clever ruse to cover your tracks, and the footage will reveal the truth about your involvement in the arson and the subsequent murder. The timestamp on the video will show that you were the last person seen entering the building before the fire broke out, and the security guards will corroborate your suspicious behavior. You see, I've been digging deeper, and I've uncovered a trail of deceit that leads straight to you. The evidence is mounting, and it's only a matter of time before the authorities close in. You're not as slick as you think you are, and your alibi is about to be blown to smithereens. The game's up, and it's time to face the music."
"The mechanical growl due to the voice changer makes me cringe. “Now is not the time to play dumb with me. You will go back to Atlanta, but I want you there on Wednesday. There is a room reserved for you at the Candler Hotel in downtown Atlanta. You will be met in the lobby on Thursday morning at ten a.m. by one of my representatives, and he will","accompany you to the bank and inside the vault. He will remove the contents of the safe deposit box himself. If what you say is true, and the contents have nothing to do with the Amy Holder job, then we will put this matter to bed once and for all and continue forward as we have. And you will find the detectives in Atlanta will quickly lose interest in you.”",139,"give you further instructions regarding the meeting with the investors, which is crucial for the success of your project. I expect you to be punctual and cooperative, as any delays or complications will be detrimental to the entire operation. You will also be provided with a briefcase containing all the necessary documents and materials you will need for the meeting. I suggest you review them thoroughly before your arrival, as it will save time and ensure a smoother discussion. Additionally, I want you to be aware that there will be a security detail accompanying you to and from the meeting, so you will not be able to leave the hotel or the meeting location without their permission. This is not a request, but a requirement, and I expect you to comply without question. Do I make myself clear?"
"“With the shit you’re in with me, that’s what you want to know? The only thing that matters is getting back what Amy Holder took.","All of it.” He’s quiet a moment and then adds, “At one time you were my best asset and now look how far you’ve fallen.”",50,"from me, and I don't care if it takes every last penny I have or if I have to sell my soul to the devil himself, I'll get it back, no matter what it costs, no matter who I have to hurt or betray along the way, because that's what this is all about, getting revenge for what she did to me, and I won't rest until I've got it in my hands, no matter how long it takes or what I have to do to get it."
I pointed to the space on my tee where a name tag would be if I had one. “George. It was the name,on your uniform at the hotel in Hilton Head.” He seemed surprised I would remember that. “But I’m guessing that’s not your real name.”,47,"was the name my parents had given me, but I'd never felt like it truly fit, like it was just a label slapped on a box that didn't quite contain the right contents. I'd always felt like I was searching for something more, something that would make me feel like I belonged, like I was meant to be here, in this place, with these people, doing this job. But what that something was, I had no idea, and the more I thought about it, the more it seemed like a myth, a fairy tale, a dream that I'd never wake up from."
"“Okay, George it is.” He started to step away, but he stopped when I","asked, “You coming to Florida with me? Or do you have other deliveries to make?”",29,"asked him to wait, my voice barely above a whisper, and he turned back to me with a questioning look, his eyes narrowing slightly as he searched my face for any sign of what I was thinking."
"But Tyron is smart. Even though he’s been offered money, he hasn’t taken any of it. Because when it comes down to it, Tyron is the one with the most at stake. If he","loses his eligibility, he doesn’t play. There’s a close to zero chance he’ll go to the NFL, where he’d finally get paid what he’s worth, if he doesn’t have a successful college football career first.",69,"stumbles, he's the one who'll be left with nothing, his reputation tarnished, and his future uncertain. His family's livelihood depends on his success, and he knows that one wrong move could ruin everything they've worked for. So, he's chosen to rely on his own abilities, to trust in his skills and his instincts, rather than taking a shortcut that might seem easier but could ultimately lead to disaster."
"By the second week, I’m exhausted. Even though Devon and I are dividing and conquering, it takes us all day to",skim through footage from all five locations and separate the relevant parts before George knocks on my door in his UPS uniform.,43,"complete the tasks that were supposed to be finished in a day, and I'm starting to feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work that needs to be done, not to mention the constant interruptions and distractions that seem to plague us at every turn, making it difficult to focus on anything for more than a few minutes at a time."

He shakes his head slowly. “Nope. Mr. Tate has employed a system that records every second of what happens in that room and there’s an alarm that goes off if the feed is interrupted for longer than that amount of time. But I,can’t override or bypass it because that system is in the room. Can’t be accessed remotely either.” He points to two areas and goes into a complicated description of wires that need to be short-circuited and lots of other things that I don’t understand.,87,"don't think it's just a coincidence that the feed went down right when the incident occurred, and I'm starting to suspect that someone deliberately tampered with the system to cover their tracks. The question is, who and why? I've reviewed the footage from the previous days, and there's nothing out of the ordinary, but I did notice that one of the security guards was acting suspiciously around the time of the incident. I've asked him to come in for questioning, but so far, he's been tight-lipped about the whole thing. I'm also looking into the possibility of an inside job, maybe someone who has access to the system and knew exactly how to disable it without triggering the alarm. It's a long shot, but I have to consider all possibilities at this point. I've also spoken to the other staff members who were working that day, and they all seem shaken by what happened, but none of them have any idea who could have done it. I'm starting to feel like we're dealing with a mastermind here, someone who's been planning this for a while and knew exactly how to stay under the radar. I've asked for additional security to be posted around the building, just in case this person tries to strike again. I'm also going to review the security footage from other areas of the building to see if there's any other evidence that might point to the perpetrator. It's a complex case, but I'm determined to get to the bottom of it."
I shove a few fries in my mouth while I consider my next move. “I need to go to Austin for a few days. Tate is having a huge Fourth of July party at his house this weekend. Might be the best time to hit him if you can get it,"all figured out by then. Get everything we need while I’m gone.” It’s a risk putting it off since I don’t know who else or even how many other people are trying to get that painting, but it’s a risk worth taking, especially if Devon needs more time on his end.",102,"get your hands on some information about his new business venture. I've heard rumors that he's planning to launch a new product line, and I need to know more about it. Plus, it's been a while since we've caught up, and I'm sure he'd be happy to see me. I'll just have to convince him to spill the beans, but I'm sure it'll be worth it. I'll make sure to bring some of my famous guacamole to the party, and we can catch up on everything that's been going on in each other's lives. I'm sure it'll be a blast, and I'll be able to get the information I need to take my business to the next level. I just hope I can get there without running into any of his friends who might try to distract me from my mission. With any luck, I'll be able to get in and out without anyone noticing, and I'll be back in time for the fireworks display on the lake. It's going to be a great weekend, and I'm excited to see what Tate has in store for us."
Sawyer gives me a grin while he grabs my ass with one hand and pushes open the back door with the other. He’s going,"to be a tough one to wrangle. But if there’s one thing I know, it’s how to handle trust fund babies with big egos.",48,"to lead me into the dimly lit alleyway, the smell of garbage and exhaust fumes filling my nostrils as he pulls me close, his warm breath on my neck sending shivers down my spine, and I try to process the sudden rush of emotions that come with being in his presence, the way my heart skips a beat when he whispers something in my ear, his voice low and husky, sending a wave of excitement through me, and I wonder what he has planned, his eyes gleaming with a mischievous spark in the faint moonlight that filters through the narrow alley, and I feel a thrill of anticipation as he starts to move closer, his body inches from mine, the air thick with tension between us, and I try to catch my breath, my mind racing with possibilities, as he leans in, his lips inches from mine, and I feel my pulse pounding in my ears, my heart racing with excitement, and I wonder what will happen next, will he kiss me, or will he pull back, leaving me wanting more, and I'm not sure if I'm ready for this, but a part of me is screaming to take the leap, to see where this wild ride will take us, and I feel a sense of trepidation mixed with excitement as I wait for his next move, my heart pounding in my chest, my senses on high alert, and I'm not sure if I'm ready for the adventure that's unfolding before me."
"Sawyer and I, along with twenty of his closest friends, show up an hour late. I’ve done as much recon on this little group as I can, trying to see if anyone else is using him to","get inside the house, but they have been fried since last night, so I think I’m the only plant. It didn’t hurt being the girl to show up with the edibles to ensure they stayed that way.",74,"get to the top, but so far, it seems like they're all genuinely passionate about the cause, and Sawyer's influence is more of a unifying factor than a manipulative one. As we enter the dimly lit room, the air is thick with anticipation, and the murmur of hushed conversations fills the air. I take a deep breath, trying to blend in, and make my way through the crowd, my eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble or potential allies. Sawyer spots me and flashes a quick smile, before turning back to the group, his voice rising above the din as he begins to speak, his words weaving a spell that draws us all in, and I find myself swept up in the tide of his enthusiasm, my initial skepticism slowly giving way to a sense of excitement and possibility."
"Like clockwork, Amy pushes through the double glass doors of the bar at 5:25 p.m. For the last two weeks, she has stayed home until","around five in the evening, then she commutes a measly two miles to this country club, where she’ll drown herself in vodka martinis until closing.",50,"the sun dips below the horizon, but tonight she has a meeting with a potential client at 6:00 p.m. and needs to make a good impression, so she has decided to arrive early to collect her thoughts and observe the atmosphere of the bar, which is known for its dim lighting and eclectic decor, and as she steps inside, the sounds of jazz music and the murmur of hushed conversations envelop her, transporting her to a world that is both familiar and yet, somehow, foreign, a world where the stresses of her daily routine seem to melt away, and for a moment, she can forget about the weight of her responsibilities and simply be, but as she makes her way to the bar, her eyes scan the room, searching for a glimpse of the person she is supposed to meet, and that's when she sees him, sitting in the corner, sipping a whiskey on the rocks, his eyes fixed intently on her, a small, enigmatic smile playing on his lips, and Amy feels a shiver run down her spine as she realizes that this meeting may be more than just a simple business transaction."
Amy is five foot seven with an athletic build and honey-blond hair that hits right below,"her shoulders. The makeup is light, the jewelry is nonexistent, and she rocks a perpetual resting-bitch face.",33,"her chin, and her bright blue eyes sparkle with a hint of mischief, a trait that often catches people off guard, given her wholesome and gentle demeanor, which she maintains with a warm and radiant smile that can light up a room, and her effortless charm has a way of putting those around her at ease, making her a beloved figure in her community."
"Amy brings her glass to her lips and takes a deep drink, finishing it off, then waves the empty","glass in the air. “You’ll never, ever, ever find it!” She’s loud enough that several heads turn her way.",38,"glasses to the bartender, who raises an eyebrow in a silent question, and Amy smiles, her eyes sparkling with a hint of mischief, as she signals for another round, the dim lighting and soft music of the bar creating a sense of intimacy that makes her feel like she's the only person in the room, and for a moment, she lets herself get lost in the sensation, the stress and anxiety of her day melting away with each passing minute, as she savors the taste of the drink and the company of the strangers around her, who seem to be enjoying their own private worlds, just as she is."
"Opening the driver’s-side door, I catch her before she falls out onto the concrete. I dig through her purse to find her keys, shoving them in my pocket. Grabbing Amy underneath her arms, I drag her from the car and up the driveway. She loses one shoe and then the other. I","almost want to flip off the camera I know is pointed at me, but I resist and keep my body turned away from the street as much as possible. It’s slow and steady until we get to the front door. Blessed silence meets us as I get the door unlocked and open.",104,"am relieved when I finally reach the front door, fumbling for my keys to unlock it. I manage to get us inside, slamming the door shut behind us, and then I gently lower Amy onto the couch. She looks up at me with a mixture of confusion and fear in her eyes, and I try to reassure her that everything will be okay. I rush to the kitchen to grab a glass of water, bringing it back to her and helping her sit up. She takes a few sips, and I can see the color returning to her face. I try to ask her what happened, but she just shakes her head, her eyes welling up with tears. I sit down beside her, holding her hand, and wait for her to process what just occurred. The sound of sirens can be heard in the distance, and I know we need to come up with a plan to explain this to the police. I glance around the room, trying to think of a convincing story, but my mind is a blank. Amy's grip on my hand tightens, and I look back at her, searching for any sign of what she might be thinking. The sound of the sirens grows louder, and I know we're running out of time."
Amy relocated to a hotel in downtown Atlanta the day after I searched her house. That was four days ago. I’m,in my car watching her stumble out of a corner bar the way she does when she’s had at least four martinis.,43,"still trying to process the events that led to her sudden departure, and the eerie feeling that I'm being watched has only intensified since she left, making me wonder if I should have been more vigilant, more protective of her, and more honest with myself about the true nature of our complicated relationship."
