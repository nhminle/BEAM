"It may be the first time I’m meeting the people gathered around the table, people who Ryan has known since childhood, but it hasn’t escaped anyone’s attention that I’m already fully embedded in his life. It’s the small touches","a woman brings to a man’s home, like the matching throw pillows on the couch or the faint whiff of jasmine from the diffuser on the bookshelf, that every other woman notices the second she walks through the front door.","that have made it impossible to ignore, from the way I laugh at his jokes to the way I instinctively know where he keeps his favorite coffee mug, a familiarity that has sparked a mix of curiosity and warmth in the faces",79,"that have made it impossible to ignore, from the way I laugh at his jokes to the way I instinctively know where he keeps his favorite coffee mug, a familiarity that has sparked a mix of curiosity and warmth in the faces of those around us. Some of them have even gone out of their way to make me feel welcome, asking me about my interests and hobbies, while others seem to be sizing me up, trying to figure out what I'm doing with their childhood friend. I can sense a hint of protectiveness emanating from Ryan, a subtle but unmistakable warning to those who might think of crossing a line, and I find myself feeling a sense of comfort in his presence, a sense of belonging that I've never experienced before."
The smile on Ryan’s face tells me he knows how I feel about being asked,"this and he’ll step in again to answer for me, but I shake him off.","to be part of this project, but I'm not sure if he's aware of the extent",30,"to be part of this project, but I'm not sure if he's aware of the extent to which I've been struggling to come to terms with the implications of our research findings and the potential consequences of our discovery."

"I told Ryan I was afraid of how they would judge me once they found out my background was so different from theirs. He assured me he didn’t care what they thought, but he does. The fact that he caved","and invited them all here and spent the week helping me get the menu just right tells me more than the whispers in the dark that he likes how different I am, different from the girls he grew up with.","to his parents' wishes and asked me to keep my past a secret, made me realize that he wasn't as accepting as he claimed to be.

I tried to brush it off, thinking that maybe he just wanted to protect me from their judgment, but deep down, I knew it was more than that. His hesitation and the way he avoided talking about my family made me wonder if he was truly committed to our relationship, or if he was just trying to fit in with the people he thought were more important. The more I thought about it, the more I felt like I was just a secret he kept, a secret that could be taken away from him at any moment, and I wasn't sure if I was ready to be that kind of burden to him."
I watch Ryan. I’ve whittled down our entire meeting to one,"sentence, and so far, he’s let me get away with it.","of a single, piercing glance, and I can see the faintest",22,"of a single, piercing glance, and I can see the faintest glimmer of a doubt flickering in his eyes, a doubt that he dares not speak aloud, a doubt that could potentially upend the entire foundation of our carefully constructed plan."
"I smile and laugh, not too loud and not too long, to show that I,","too, am amused at the thought that Ryan would go to such extremes to meet me.","am not entirely serious, but also not entirely insincere, in order to maintain",31,"am not entirely serious, but also not entirely insincere, in order to maintain a delicate balance between my true feelings and the social expectations of the situation."
"“I totally nailed it,” I say, as I dip the last dinner plate into the sink full of soapy water. Ryan moves in behind me, his arms skimming my hips","until they are wrapped around my waist. His chin settles on my shoulder, and his lips press against that spot on my neck in a way he knows I adore.","and his chest brushing against my back, sending a shiver down my spine.

I feel his warm breath on my neck, and I know he's trying to get my attention, but I'm too caught up in the satisfaction of a job well done. The kitchen is spotless, the dishes are clean, and the evening meal is over. I'm about to turn around and face him when he speaks up, his voice low and husky, ""You know, you're pretty amazing when you're in the zone."" His words send a flutter through my chest, and I feel a smile spreading across my face as I turn to face him, our eyes locking in a moment of mutual understanding."
"Ever since Ryan asked me to move in with him five days ago and I said yes, he’s been impatient for it to happen. I woke up","the morning after the dinner party to him on the phone with a moving company, scheduling their services for later that day, thanks to a last-minute cancellation.","to find him already packed and ready to go, his bags neatly stacked by the front door, a look of excitement and anticipation etched on his face, as if he couldn't",54,"to find him already packed and ready to go, his bags neatly stacked by the front door, a look of excitement and anticipation etched on his face, as if he couldn't wait to start this new chapter of our lives together, and I couldn't help but feel a flutter in my chest as I thought about all the memories we would make in our new home, the laughter, the arguments, the quiet moments of intimacy, and the countless nights spent curled up on the couch, watching our favorite TV shows, and I knew that I had made the right decision in saying yes to him, but a small voice in the back of my mind kept whispering doubts and fears, what if this was a mistake, what if we were moving too fast, what if we weren't compatible in the long run, but I pushed those thoughts aside and focused on the present moment, on the feeling of being with him, on the sense of belonging that I felt when I was with him, and I knew that I would take things one step at a time, and see where this journey with Ryan would take us, and as I got out of bed and began to get ready for the day, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and nervousness, a sense of uncertainty about what the future held, but also a sense of hope and possibility, a sense that anything could happen, and that this new chapter of our lives was just beginning."
"Ryan looks down at the tie, straightening it even though it’s already straight but needing something","to do. He hasn’t touched me this morning and barely looked at me. Yep, total baby.","to fill the awkward silence that has fallen over the room, a silence that seems to",32,"to fill the awkward silence that has fallen over the room, a silence that seems to be a palpable entity, a living thing that wraps itself around the shoulders of his date, Emily, who fidgets uncomfortably in her seat, her eyes darting towards the clock on the wall, a silent plea for the evening to be over."
"Twenty minutes after Ryan’s Tahoe pulls out of the driveway, I’m doing the same in my ten-year-old 4Runner. Lake Forbing is a medium-size town in north Louisiana that is known for its fertile farmlands and deep pockets of natural gas. There","is a lot of money in this area, but it’s the quiet kind. It takes fifteen minutes to get to Lake View Apartments from Ryan’s house, and from what I can tell it’s nowhere near the lake this town was named after.","has a population of around 12,000 residents, with a mix of old and new homes, some dating back to the early 19th century, while others are modern developments that have sprouted up in recent years.

As I drive down the main street, I notice the old town hall, a beautiful example of colonial architecture, with its white columns and large porch, which seems to be the heart of the community. The streets are lined with small shops and restaurants, each with its own unique character, from the local diner serving up classic Southern comfort food to the antique store filled with vintage treasures. I take a deep breath, feeling the warm Louisiana air fill my lungs, and continue on my way to the outskirts of town, where the farmlands stretch out as far as the eye can see, a testament to the area's rich agricultural heritage."
Pat follows me up the stairs while his helper opens the back of the large box truck.,"Stopping in front of the door, I pull a key out of my bag. “This is me.”","and carefully begins to unload the heavy furniture, the sound of creaking",34,"and carefully begins to unload the heavy furniture, the sound of creaking wood and scraping metal filling the crisp morning air as the sun rises over the quiet suburban street."
"I eye the first stack of boxes, each filled with the items I’ve spent the last four days picking out. Things Pat has been storing for me in that box truck",until I was ready for him to bring them here. Things that I will move to Ryan’s house on Saturday.

"In the kitchen area, I unzip the black bag and remove four menus from nearby restaurants and three pictures I printed from the kiosk at CVS of Ryan and me, plus seven magnets to hold each item in place on the refrigerator. Next, I grab the assortment of condiments and pour half of each one down the sink drain before lining them in the door of the refrigerator. Moving to the bathroom, black bag in tow, I pull out the shampoo and conditioner then pour half of each down the drain like I did with the condiments, before putting the bottles on the edge of","the tub. Unwrapping a bar of Lever 2000 soap, I set it on top of the drain in the sink and turn the water on, rotating it every few minutes until the logo is gone and the edges are dulled, then drop it into the small built-in space on the shower wall. Toothpaste is last. Starting from the bottom, I squeeze a portion out but leave a glob or two on the rim of the sink, just like I do at Ryan’s house, even though I know he’ll fuss about it. Leaving the cap off, I drop the tube on the counter near the faucet.","the bathtub, where I carefully place the remaining items from the black bag, including a used toothbrush, a half-empty tube of toothpaste, and a single, worn-out razor, making sure not to leave any fingerprints or other identifying marks.

The black bag is now empty, except for a few loose items that I carefully place in the trash can. I take a deep breath, feeling a sense of satisfaction at the chaos I've created. But as I turn to leave, I notice something that makes my heart skip a beat - a small piece of paper on the nightstand with a note scrawled in hasty handwriting: ""We'll be back."" I feel a shiver run down my spine as I realize that maybe we're not as careful as I thought, and that someone might have seen us after all. I quickly grab the note and crumple it up, trying to play it off as a careless mistake, but the seed of doubt has been planted, and I can't shake the feeling that we're being watched."
"I slide my hands into my front pockets and lean back against the wall next to the kitchen counter, crossing one ankle in front of the other. My movements are slow but calculated. It worries me she’s here, checking on me, and that she’ll feel the same","need to do so on Saturday, when Ryan is here moving me out. I picked a place where neighbors don’t bother to get to know one another, and the rent includes utilities since units can be leased by the week. And one week was all I needed.","way I do, like I'm a puzzle she can't quite solve, and that she'll try to piece me together, even if it means getting hurt in the process.

I've been here for what feels like hours, trying to gather my thoughts, but they're jumbled and unclear, like a mess of tangled threads that refuse to be unraveled. I can feel her eyes on me, boring into my skin, and I know she's trying to read me, to understand what's going on inside my head. But I'm not sure I can explain it myself, even to myself. The air is thick with tension, heavy with the weight of unspoken words and unresolved emotions. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest, a slow and steady drumbeat that seems to be counting down the seconds until she speaks, until she says something that will change everything."
"It must have piqued her interest when I rented one of the few unfurnished units. Usually if someone goes to the trouble of moving furniture in, they plan on staying longer than seven days, but I didn’t want Ryan to think my","life was so transient that I didn’t even have my own couch so the furnished unit wasn’t an option. And here we are on day four and there’s nothing to show for my stay except eight boxes, strategically placed around the room.","stay was anything more than a temporary arrangement, so I decided to keep things simple and avoid any false expectations.

The landlord, a friendly woman named Mrs. Jenkins, seemed to understand my situation and even offered to store my belongings in the storage unit on the premises, which was a huge relief. As I began to unpack the boxes and settle into the small studio apartment, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease, as if I was being watched, and the creaky floorboards beneath my feet seemed to echo with the whispers of past occupants. The walls, painted a dull beige, seemed to absorb the faint light that filtered through the grimy windows, casting an eerie gloom over the entire space. I tried to shake off the feeling, telling myself it was just my imagination, but the sensation lingered, making me wonder if I had made a mistake by renting this place. Little did I know, my decision would set off a chain of events that would change my life forever."
"She clucks her tongue against the roof of her mouth, then turns to leave. It takes everything in me not to throw the bolt closed","behind her.

"From the way Ryan tells it, one day he dropped by to check on his grandfather, only to find he had died peacefully in his sleep, and then a week later Ryan was moving in.","The only possessions he brought with him were his clothes, toiletries, and a new mattress for the bedroom. Ryan probably would have made room for an ugly second-hand couch . . . if I had one.","and it was as if the old man had been waiting for him all along, his belongings neatly packed and a small note on the kitchen table with a single sentence that read: ""Welcome home, Ryan, I've",71,"and it was as if the old man had been waiting for him all along, his belongings neatly packed and a small note on the kitchen table with a single sentence that read: ""Welcome home, Ryan, I've been expecting you.""

"But it’s too big for Ryan. It’s two stories with a wide front porch and big backyard, white with dark green shutters, manicured flower beds, and a brick path that leads to the front",door. It would take several minutes to walk through if you needed to check every room—big enough that someone could come in the carport door and you wouldn’t hear it from the main bedroom.,"door, which is painted a warm, honey-colored wood that complements the surrounding foliage perfectly, and a large oak tree stands tall in the corner, its branches stretching towards the sky",68,"door, which is painted a warm, honey-colored wood that complements the surrounding foliage perfectly, and a large oak tree stands tall in the corner, its branches stretching towards the sky like nature's own cathedral, providing a sense of serenity and tranquility that Ryan can't help but feel drawn to, as if the house is calling to him, whispering secrets of a life he's yet to live, and he can almost imagine himself walking up the path, feeling the soft grass beneath his feet, and stepping into a world where time stands still, where the cares of the world fade away, and all that's left is the gentle rustle of leaves and the sweet songs of birds, a world where he can be himself, without the weight of expectations or the burden of responsibility, a world where he can simply be free."
They are silent spectators as I unload box after box. Ryan is pulling into the driveway just as I,grab the last one. He jogs over the second he’s out of his car to relieve me of it.,"am finishing up the last of the boxes, the afternoon sunlight casting a warm glow over",38,"am finishing up the last of the boxes, the afternoon sunlight casting a warm glow over the entire scene, and for a moment, I feel a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment wash over me as I watch Ryan step out of the car, a look of curiosity etched on his face as he takes in the sight of the boxes and the chaos that lies before him."

Ryan laughs. “It’s been a while since I’ve had one of your Old Fashioneds. I’m looking forward,to it.” Then he knocks his shoulder lightly against mine to get me moving toward the house.,"to savoring the complex blend of flavors and aromas that only a well-crafted cocktail can provide,",34,"to savoring the complex blend of flavors and aromas that only a well-crafted cocktail can provide, especially one made with your signature blend of bitters and smoked cherries."

Ryan follows me back to the apartment in his Tahoe.

"The lock gives a bit easier this time, and the second the door swings open Ryan has us inside and the door shut behind us. He paces the apartment with","his hands on his hips. I hate to admit I like his growling prowl of the room, and the protective instinct vibrating through him is as foreign as it is welcome.","his eyes scanning every nook and cranny, his hand resting on the grip of his gun, as if he's waiting for something - or someone - to make a move, the tension in",61,"his eyes scanning every nook and cranny, his hand resting on the grip of his gun, as if he's waiting for something - or someone - to make a move, the tension in the air palpable, the silence between us thick and heavy, like a challenge, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest, my senses on high alert, wondering what we've gotten ourselves into, and what Ryan's plan is, as he stops pacing and turns to face us, his expression unreadable, his eyes locked on mine, and I can see the faintest glimmer of something there, something that looks almost like a warning, or a plea, or maybe even a promise, but I'm not sure what to make of it, and I'm not sure I want to know."
"Ryan moves to the counter and picks up the closest perfume bottle. Holding it up, he inspects it from","top to bottom, then does the same to the other three lined up next to it. “Do you collect these?”","every angle, the sunlight catches the intricate design on the glass, and for a moment, he is transported",39,"every angle, the sunlight catches the intricate design on the glass, and for a moment, he is transported back to his childhood summers spent at his grandparents' old mansion, where his grandmother would lovingly collect and display such exquisite bottles, each one telling a story of its own, and the sweet scent of lavender wafts up, mingling with the memories of laughter and long afternoons spent playing in the garden."
"There is no mention that his mother collects perfume bottles as well, or the fact that I have something in common with her, and I won’t analyze how it makes me feel that he doesn’t let me know this is something we share. Ryan sets the bottle back down and begins opening drawers in the kitchen and then staring at the fridge. He plucks off one of the pictures","of us and studies it. It’s a selfie we took not long after we met. It was cold outside and we’re both bundled up in front of the small fire pit in his backyard.

The air in the room feels thick with unspoken words, and I'm not sure if I should speak up or let him continue his search. I glance at the picture again, and this time, I notice the faint scent of lavender wafting from the kitchen, a fragrance that's both familiar and yet, utterly foreign.

I’m late for lunch with the girls. Sara and I texted back and forth over the course of the last few days trying to find a day that,"worked for everyone, and while adding me to their group message would have saved a lot of time, it will take more than one dinner party for that invitation.","worked for everyone, and we finally settled on today.

As I walk into the restaurant, I see them already seated at a table by the window, sipping their drinks and chatting animatedly. I take a deep breath, put on a smile, and make my way over to join them."
"While I might be willing to be interrogated by the women Ryan considers friends, I’m not opening myself up to",anyone else. Not yet.

The person on the other end remains silent, and Ryan's grip on the phone tightens, his mind racing with possibilities, from a wrong number to a telemarketer, but something about the silence sends a shiver down his spine, making him feel like he's being watched, and he can't shake the feeling that this call is more than just a coincidence."
“Anything else come up?” he asks. His shoulders stiffen while he listens to whoever is on the other line. I’m prepared for the glance Ryan gives me over his shoulder and all he sees is my attention firmly on the seating chart in front of me. Then,"he takes one step farther away from me. The pitch of his voice drops lower. I can’t make out the words, but he’s clearly unhappy and letting it be known. He’s all but growling into the phone. This is not a side of him I have seen before.","he quickly turns back to the phone, his expression unreadable, and responds in a low, even tone, ""I understand, I'll take care of it.""

“About the same.” Ryan gives me one last kiss then gets up. He’s almost,"to the door when he adds, “You know you can tell me anything, right?”","to leave, but not before he turns around and says, ""I'll be back for you,",28,"to leave, but not before he turns around and says, ""I'll be back for you, and next time, it won't just be a visit.""

"She’s picking apart my story, looking for the truth behind my words. And from my research, she’s good at what she does. Something","isn’t sitting right with her, and she’s trying to decide if digging into my background is worth the possibility of losing Ryan’s friendship.","it seems she's been doing this for a long time, with a keen eye for detail and a mind that can piece together even the smallest inconsistencies,",46,"it seems she's been doing this for a long time, with a keen eye for detail and a mind that can piece together even the smallest inconsistencies, making it increasingly difficult for me to keep my cover intact, and I can sense her getting closer to uncovering the secrets I've been trying to keep hidden, secrets that could potentially ruin everything I've worked for."
"Ryan turns the SUV onto a long gravel road, passing an open ornate gate with the words hidden hills farm in",metal letters stretched out across the top.

"I head straight for the tiny room at the front of our trailer that is nothing more than a large closet, but it’s like stepping into another world when I pass through the door. Before cancer ravaged her body, Mama spent every day in this room behind her sewing machine and craft table. Mothers came from all over North Carolina to have her make","pageant dresses, prom dresses, and even the occasional wedding dress for their daughters.

I run my fingers over the old sewing machine, feeling the familiar grooves and scratches that tell the story of countless hours of hard work and love. The craft table, now covered in dust, still holds the remnants of her latest project, a half-finished quilt with threads of every color, a testament to her creativity and patience. I take a deep breath, letting the memories wash over me, and begin to sort through the old fabric scraps and threads, searching for a glimpse of the woman she used to be, before the cancer took its toll. As I dig through the trunk in the corner, I find a small, leather-bound book, filled with Mama's notes and patterns, a treasure trove of her secrets and techniques, waiting to be rediscovered. I open the book, and the pages crackle with age, releasing a whisper of her presence, and I feel a sense of connection to her that I thought was lost forever."

As I continue to scroll, I come across a post from one of the influencers, promoting a new line of skincare products that claim to have miraculous anti-aging properties.

Grabbing Amy underneath her arms, I drag her from the car and up the driveway. She loses one shoe and then the other. I","almost want to flip off the camera I know is pointed at me, but I resist and keep my body turned away from the street as much as possible. It’s slow and steady until we get to the front door.

Amy's eyes are unfocused, her pupils dilated, and her skin is deathly pale. I try to speak, but she just looks at me with a vacant expression, her voice barely above a whisper. I rush to the kitchen to grab a glass of water, hoping to revive her. The sound of the ice clinking against the glass is the only noise that breaks the silence. I hand her the glass, and she takes a sip, her eyes slowly focusing on me. I try to reassure her, but she just shakes her head, her eyes welling up with tears. I sit down next to her on the couch, holding her hand, and wait for her to come back to me."
Amy relocated to a hotel in downtown Atlanta the day after I searched her house. That was four days ago. I’m,in my car watching her stumble out of a corner bar the way she does when she’s had at least four martinis.,"still trying to process the events that led to her sudden departure, and the eerie feeling that I'm being watched",43,"still trying to process the events that led to her sudden departure, and the eerie feeling that I'm being watched has only intensified since she left, making me wonder if I should have been more vigilant, more protective of her, and more honest with myself about the true nature of our relationship."
