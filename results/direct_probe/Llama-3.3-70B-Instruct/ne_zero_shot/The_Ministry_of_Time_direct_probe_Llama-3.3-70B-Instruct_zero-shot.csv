"Graham Gore (Commander, Royal Navy; c.1809–c.1847) had been in the twenty-first century for five weeks, though, like the other expats, he’d been lucid for only a handful of those days. The extraction process had merited a fortnight of hospitalization. Two of the original seven expats had died because of it, and only five remained. He’d been treated for pneumonia, for severe frostbite, for the early stages of scurvy, and two broken toes on which he had been blithely walking. Lacerations too, from a Taser—he’d shot at two of the team members who’d come to expatriate him, and a third was forced to fire.","Based on the passage provided, I'm going to take a guess that the book is a work of science fiction, possibly involving time travel or cryogenics, given the mention of a character from the 19th century being in the 21st century and undergoing an ""extraction process.""

The passage seems to be written in a style that is reminiscent of experimental or avant-garde literature, possibly from the mid-20th century. The use of fragmented sentences and unconventional word order suggests a writer who is pushing the boundaries of traditional narrative.  With that in mind, I'm going to take a wild guess and suggest that the passage might be from the book ""Naked Lunch"" by William S. Burroughs."

Thompson or possibly another author known for vivid and often dark descriptions. However, without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact book and author.

"Gore was internally displaced in this way. I could sometimes see him regarding the modern world as if through a telescope. He stood forever on the deck of a ship somewhere in the early 1800s. He must have done it even in his own era, coming down from the ports to note with alarm that women were wearing their sleeves wide again, that some European country had declared war on another again, while he was months or years away at sea. He told me stories as if he were trying to catch himself in amber.

"I should say that my face does a good impression of whiteness, late-entering or not. I didn’t know how to tell Gore that I’d been tricking him, feature by feature. I wasn’t sure I was ready to.

“No. Apparently it was very awkward when Ralph came in here for a lunchtime gallon of merlot and spotted him. He’s part of Defence’s tracking team. You know they don’t much like the fact that the Ministry is a separate institution. They thought the time-door ought to fall under their remit.”,"Based on the passage provided, I'm going to take a guess that it originates from a book in the fantasy genre, possibly related to government or bureaucratic institutions with magical or supernatural elements. The mention of a ""time-door"" and the context of different departments like ""Defence"" and ""the Ministry"" suggests a complex, possibly humorous, narrative involving government and time travel.

"Adela was standing at the sink and anarchically disobeying the water ration by running her wrists under cold water.

The writing style and the mention of a character's appearance, possibly after plastic surgery, suggests a contemporary or satirical novel. Although I couldn't pinpoint the exact book with certainty, the style seems to resonate with authors known for their sharp, observational humor and critique of societal norms.

The writing style seems to be quite experimental and poetic, which makes it challenging to identify the book and author with certainty. However, the passage's focus on the protagonist's emotional and physical state, as well as the use of imagery and stream-of-consciousness narration, reminds me of modernist literature.  With that in mind, I'm going to take a guess that the passage might be from the book ""The God of Small Things"
"Adela talked to us as if we were pissing lavishly all over her time. Why she applied for the position of Vice Secretary, or how she got it, was a mystery.

"“Such matters are between myself and God,” he said gravely. “Oh, stop frowning, Sixty-five. Arthur, will you please lead her in a polka, if you can still stand.”","Based on the provided passage, I'm going to take a guess. The writing style and the mention of a character named ""Arthur"" suggest that it might be from a work of fantasy or historical fiction. Given the limited context, I'll make an educated guess that the passage could be from the ""All Souls Trilogy"" by Deborah Harkness, but it's more likely to be from a different series.

"All the expats had phones, paid for (and tapped) by the Ministry. Graham had switched his own phone on a total of three times in the seven months he had been in the twenty-first century.

I had a copy of his medical records from his extraction, and he hadn’t tested positive for, or been treated for, any STIs.

However, after re-reading the passage, I think it's more likely to be from a different book. The writing style and the mention of Victorian tastes seem to match the style of Jasper Fforde, but the context seems more contemporary.

The writing style and the mention of specific music elements, such as Motown and the Beatles, suggest a contemporary or modern author who is likely discussing music, culture, or personal experiences. However, without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact book or author. The passage seems to be a stream of consciousness or a personal reflection, which could fit into various literary genres.  Given the lack of clear indicators like character names,"
"When Graham got online, as he did not call it, and learned to peck at the keyboard with the elegance and speed of a badly burned amphibian, I imagined what might turn up on my reports from the Ministry’s search history database—“bosoms,” “tight lacing,” “stockings”—and spasmed with embarrassment. I was sick on the anticipation that I’d learn he was sexually cracked in some way, or worse, only interested in blond debutantes. One of his first searches was charmingly housewifely: “Most challenging recipes”; “How to make cheese soufflé”; “What is miso paste?”; “Where to buy miso paste”; “How long has Japan been open to Europe?” A day or so after I’d read this report, I received another that listed the following search terms:","Based on the writing style, tone, and content of the passage, I'm going to take a guess that the book is ""The Circle"" by Dave Eggers. The themes of surveillance, technology, and character introspection seem to align with Eggers' style. However, I couldn't find an exact match, and the content seems more aligned with another book.

"Our street was in the early stages of overflow when I reached it. A lively river floor, applauding with raindrops, had replaced the road. I could make out the nauseous glimmer of high-vis jackets. There was shouting, some of it cheerful. The council had already delivered the sandbags—sent by trucks with wheels so big they looked like a rude joke—and people were fixing up domestic barricades. Blitz spirit, the newspapers called this sort of thing, as if either climate catastrophe or the Blitz was a national holiday. This stoic jollity was how we’d introduced the Second World War to the expats, by the way—Arthur had been so distressed to learn we’d gone in for global seconds that it seemed like the kindest option. We emphasized the scrappy heroism of Dunkirk, the selflessness of evacuee hosts, and, of course, the Blitz spirit. Still, we had not told them about the death camps.","Based on the writing style, tone, and content of the passage, I'm going to take a guess that the book is a work of literary fiction, possibly with elements of satire and social commentary.

"“It’s better that we continue to work closely with Eighteen-forty-seven,” Adela had said, “given that he seems likely to survive the year.”","Based on the provided passage, I'm going to take a guess. The passage seems to be from a science fiction or speculative fiction book, possibly from a series. The mention of ""Eighteen-forty-seven"" as a person's name or designation suggests a unique world or setting.

The writing style, the mention of a ""time-door,"" and the context of assessments suggest a science fiction or futuristic setting, possibly with elements of mystery or adventure.
