"“I think I’m all set here,” he says, and lol of course he isn’t going to kiss me. “But if I forgot anything, you can have Jake come pick it up.”","Based on the provided passage, I'm going to take a guess. The passage seems to be a contemporary or young adult romance novel, given the casual tone and the mention of a potential kiss. However, without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact book.
