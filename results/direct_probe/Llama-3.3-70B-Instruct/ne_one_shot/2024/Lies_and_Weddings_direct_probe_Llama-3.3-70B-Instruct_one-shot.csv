The writing style and tone seem to be from a contemporary or modern novel, possibly from the genre of romance, comedy, or women's fiction. The mention of ""Martha"" and the context of marriage and relationships suggest a story that might be character-driven and focused on personal relationships.   Given the limited information and the fact that the passage is quite short and fragmented, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact book and author. However,"

The writing style, vocabulary, and sentence structure suggest a formal, somewhat archaic tone. The mention of ""earls"" and the discussion of family fortune and marriages also hint at a novel of manners or a romance from the same era.  With that in mind, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and propose the following:  "

“I figured. Where’s our invitation to the wedding in Venice?

Given these clues, my guess is that the passage might originate from a book by Helen Fielding, possibly from the Bridget Jones series, as it matches the tone",['peter'],Peter far Venice? our though is be will he attend.” even invitation to too very get Where’s figured. hurt “I invitation in the doesn’t an he busy if to wedding,"""title"": ""The Wedding Date"", ""author"": ""Jasmine Guillory"""

The mention of Medicare Part B and the tone of the dialogue suggest a modern American setting and a lighthearted, comedic style.

The writing style and the mention of ""Medicare"" suggest a contemporary or modern author. The passage seems to be a stream-of-consciousness or experimental piece, which is reminiscent of authors like James Joyce or Thomas Pynchon, but the tone and language used don't quite fit their styles. The mention of ""Penelope"" could be a reference to Homer's ""Odyssey,"" but the context doesn't seem to fit.  "
