The passage appears to be a fragment of a novel, possibly from a young adult or dystopian genre. The writing style and sentence structure suggest a contemporary author.

Another possibility is that it could be from a book like ""The Hunger Games"""
"Once, when we were roommates, Anna flew to Seattle with a friend. It had been her first time on an airplane, and she struggled so much navigating the travel website that she brought me her laptop at midnight and asked for help. I finished the transaction for her, prebooked the car to the airport, and then quietly tracked the ride the day she left to make sure she got there okay.

The writing style and structure of the passage seem to resemble a stream-of-consciousness narrative, which is often used in literary fiction. The use of short sentences and fragmented thoughts also suggests a modernist or postmodernist approach to storytelling.  Given these characteristics, I'm going to take a guess that the passage is from a novel by David Foster Wallace, a well-known author known for his experimental and introspective writing style.

A possible match could be ""Anna Karenina"" by Leo Tolstoy, but the passage doesn't seem to match the style"

The use of non-standard grammar and sentence structure, as well as the blending of English and Spanish, is also consistent with Díaz's style.  Here is the output:  "
