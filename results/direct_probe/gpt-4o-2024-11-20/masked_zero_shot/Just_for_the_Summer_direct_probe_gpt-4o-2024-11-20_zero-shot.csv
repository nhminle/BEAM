It appears to involve fragmented, repetitive phrases and placeholder-like elements (e.g., ""[MASK]""), which makes it challenging to pinpoint its origins. The style could be experimental or modernist.

Given the repetition of ""No"" and seemingly fragmented thought process, I will make an educated guess.
