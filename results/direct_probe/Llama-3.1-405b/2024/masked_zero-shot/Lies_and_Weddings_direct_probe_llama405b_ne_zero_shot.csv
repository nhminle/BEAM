Here's my reasoning:

* The mention of Greshamsbury Hall suggests a connection to the Chronicles of Barsetshire series by Anthony Trollope, which includes ""Doctor Thorne"".
* The tone and style of the passage, including the witty dialogue and the reference to a aristocratic title (""Serene Highness""), are consistent with Trollope's writing","I into your “How sand the have years girls and bare thing, When since very to empty my call first ago, known anymore.” Highness’ your you Outer and last even in visit they dug Hebrides the such [MASK] you think with a have don’t say camping you went bowels I seen can hands, just year. have Hall in has Greshamsbury hole Countess? three a the to someone I ‘Serene you","Based on the passage, I'm going to take a guess that the book is ""Doctor Thorne"" by Anthony Trollope.

However, the style and tone of the passage don't quite match Hemingway's distinctive writing style, so I'm not entirely confident in this guess.

An alternative guess could be a book by a different author that features whales and oceanic themes.
