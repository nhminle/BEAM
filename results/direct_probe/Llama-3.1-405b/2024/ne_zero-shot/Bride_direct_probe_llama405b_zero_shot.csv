Here's my reasoning:

* The mention of ""Councilman"" and ""agents"" suggests a dystopian or futuristic setting, which is consistent with the Hunger Games series.

Here's my reasoning:

* The passage mentions a riverbank, which is a key setting in ""East of Eden"".

Here's my reasoning:

* The writing style and tone of the passage seem to match the contemporary and conversational style of Taylor Jenkins Reid's writing.
* The mention of a character named Serena and the context of the passage, which appears to be a romantic and emotional scene, also seem to fit with the themes and character dynamics of ""The Seven"

* The use of vivid imagery, such as ""a galaxy wearing a lamp"" and ""lava flashes,"" is also characteristic of Díaz's work.
* The mention of a character"

Here's my reasoning:

* The mention of ""Serena"" makes me think of Serena van der Woodsen, a character from the popular TV show Gossip Girl, but also a character in The Devil Wears Prada.
* The tone of the passage, with its focus on schemes, organizing, and a ""vibe"" suggests a book"

Here's my reasoning:

* The passage mentions a giraffe, which is an unusual element that might be found in a literary or quirky novel.
* The mention of an office and a door suggests a setting that might be found in a contemporary or literary novel.
* The tone of the passage seems introspective and slightly humorous"

Here's my reasoning:

* The mention of a ""video game"" and ""nonplayable character"" suggests a science fiction or futuristic setting, which is consistent with the themes of ""Ready Player One"".
* The reference to ""Collateral"" could be a nod to the 2004 film of the same name, which is also referenced in ""Ready Player One"".

Here's my reasoning:

* The mention of a ""Collateral term"" and ""tutors"" or ""caregivers"" suggests a dystopian or speculative fiction setting, which is consistent with Alderman's work.
* The themes of oppression, power dynamics, and the struggle for identity and autonomy are also present in ""The Power"".

Here's my reasoning:

* The language and style of the passage seem to match the 19th-century American literature, which is consistent with Hawthorne's writing style.
* The mention of ""Hester"" in the passage is a strong hint, as Hester Prynne is the main character in ""The Scarlet Letter"".

Here's my reasoning:

* The passage has a lyrical and poetic tone, which is reminiscent of Aimee Bender's writing style.
* The focus on food and the use of sensory details (e.g. ""make berries"", ""noise rasp"", ""blue"") is also consistent with Bender's work.
* The passage has a dream"

Here's my reasoning:

* The tone and style of the passage suggest a dystopian or speculative fiction novel, which is consistent with Alderman's work.
* The mention of ""Human caregivers"" and the protagonist's concern about being watched or judged suggests a world where humans are not the dominant species, which is a theme explored in ""The Power"".
