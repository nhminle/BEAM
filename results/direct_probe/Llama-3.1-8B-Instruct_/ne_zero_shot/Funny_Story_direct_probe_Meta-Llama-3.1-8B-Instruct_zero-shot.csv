The passage seems to be a fragment of a romantic novel, possibly from the early 20th century. The writing style and the mention of a character named Daphne suggest that it might be from a classic romance novel.  My guess is that the passage is from the book ""Pride and Prejudice"" by Jane Austen. However, the passage doesn't seem to match the style of Austen's writing,"

The passage seems to be a jumbled and nonsensical sentence, which is reminiscent of the style of Lewis Carroll's writing in ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"". The use of made-up words and phrases, such as ""orange-checked of tiny waffles arms"", is also consistent with Carroll's use of wordplay and absurdity in the book.  "
