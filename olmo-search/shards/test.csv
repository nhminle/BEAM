The Pleasures of Eating: A Qualitative Analysis\n\nThe Pleasures of Eating: A Qualitative Analysis,10.1007/s10902-005-0287-x,Journal of Happiness Studies,Michael Macht,Jessica Meininger,Jochen Roth\n\nThe Pleasures of Eating: A Qualitative Analysis \u00a0 (Citations: 9)\nBibTex | RIS | RefWorks Download\nThe pleasures of eating were explored in semi-structured interviews with nine female and seven male persons. Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts revealed two substantial features of hedonic eating experiences. First, they encompass a variety of components: In the stimulus domain, the foods, features of the physical environment, and social factors; in the domain of the organism a specific somato-psychic state and an attitude towards hedonism; in the domain of responses preparatory activities, specific characteristics of eating behavior, and positive sensations and emotions. Second, pleasures of eating depend on a variety of external and internal conditions. External conditions go far beyond the food itself: Physical features of the environment and social factors amplify food-induced positive affective reactions and embed them in an individually unique setting. Internal conditions include motivational, cognitive and behavioral factors: People who enjoy eating have the explicit intention to enjoy, they eat slowly and focus upon salient features of foods and environments, and they often engage in social activities before, during and after the meal. Hedonic eating experiences can best be understood as \u201cappetite gestalten\u201d, i.e. individually specific configurations of stimuli, organism variables, and responses. A holistic, multi-component perspective is suggested as a framework for future research.\nJournal: Journal of Happiness Studies - J HAPPINESS STUD , vol. 6, no. 2, pp. 137-160, 2005\nCumulative Annual\nView Publication\nSort by:
28 January 2009\n\nSeeking relief in the courts\n\nSo, California ER docs are suing the state of California over low reimbursement rates from Medi-Cal, the state insurance program for the indigent.\n\nWell isn't that interesting\n\nIt's hard not to see this, coming as it does on the heels of the California Supreme Court's prohibition on balance billing, as a planned step in a coordinated strategy, especially as it involves several large ER groups.\u00a0\u00a0 But I don't think so.\u00a0\u00a0 It's reactionary -- in response to the recent budget cuts, I think, rather than being logically related to the balance billing issue.\u00a0\u00a0 And I am not sure how well-thought-out it truly is.\u00a0 Sure, it provides a platform to get out the rhetoric that the ER safety net is unraveling, and it highlights the disgrace that is medicaid reimbursement nation-wide.\u00a0\u00a0 But if the suit is without merit, constructed on a shaky legal theory, as I suspect it is, it will be dismissed or otherwise lost.\u00a0\u00a0 That will neutralize any momentum towards reforming the Medi-Cal payment system and set the cause back quite a bit.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong -- I hope so.\u00a0\u00a0 Apparently the CMA won an injunction stopping a 10% across-the-board pay cut, so there may be grounds for this suit.\u00a0\u00a0 But it's a big risk, and I hope it doesn't backfire.\n\nAnyway, I can't see a less opportune time to file this suit -- the state's essentially bankrupt.\n\n\nphysasst said...\n\nYeah, I agree with you, as with most things, timing is paramount, and this is just an abyssmal time to think of something like this.\n\nI can't think of what they really think they might accomplish right now with this.\n\nAnonymous said...\n\ni'll be watching with great interest, but mostly expect it to accomplish nothing except make the public hate doctors for being \"greedy\"\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nat least the lawyers they hire will make money off of this. good for them.\n\nJimII said...\n\nAnons 5:09 & 5:12, do you find it strange at all to put quote marks around greedy when referring to the notion that there is something wrong with folks in the medical profession being paid what they are worth, and then posting three minutes later out of the exact same perception but of the legal profession? Are you being ironic? (BTW, obviously doctors are more valuable than lawyers, but the average lawyer in SEA makes $95K, while the average MD makes $154K. Source:Indeed.com)\n\nJimII said...\n\n\nIf there are reasonable grounds for the action, I don't know that it necessarily is a bad idea. It might very well show the government doctors are serious about demanding fair compensation, and drive a settlement or the legislative equivalent of one."
Volcano Fallout Creates Scenic Dusk\n\nOctober 10, 1991|By Knight-Ridder Tribune News.\n\nHAMPTON, VA. \u2014 A massive volcanic eruption three months ago is producing spectacular red and orange sunsets in some areas of the U.S., according to a NASA scientist.\n\n``We`ve been having these fantastic sunsets,`` said Pat McCormick, head of the aerosol research branch at NASA Langley Research Center. ``Whenever the sky is clear on the horizon, we`re going to get these glorious sunsets.``\n\nThe technicolor display is a result of June`s eruptions of Mt. Pinatubo in the Phillipines. The volcano spewed sulfur gas as high as 80,000 feet into the atmosphere. The gas is combining with water vapor to form sulphuric acid droplets.\n\nA cloud of droplets 16 miles above Earth is prolonging sunsets by up to 30 minutes, McCormick said. The longer sunsets occur as the sun sinks over the horizon and shines on the cloud.\n\nDroplets in the cloud scatter wavelengths of light. During the daytime, the nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the atmosphere scatter blue wavelengths of light, giving the sky its color. But the sulfuric acid particles are much bigger than nitrogen and oxygen molecules and scatter different wavelengths of light, particularly red and orange.\n\n``We`re getting some colors we don`t normally get,`` he said.\n\nThe cloud is too thin to be visible during the day, but at sunset the light hits the cloud at the right angle to create the longer, more colorful sunsets.\n\nMeasurements done by an instrument at the NASA research center at Langley Air Force Base near Hampton confirm that the colors are caused by the Pinatubo cloud, McCormick said.
