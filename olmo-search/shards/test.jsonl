China's tycoons embody a cultural revolution\n\nRealty duo treated like movie stars\n\nAugust 08, 2004|By Kathy Chen, The Wall Street Journal. Qiu Haixu and Cui Rong contributed to this article.\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Inside a tent amid new minimalist apartment towers, Chinese film stars and business elite mingled with Western diplomats. But the real draw of the evening were the hosts, building tycoons Pan Shiyi and Zhang Xin.\n\nZhang swept into the room wearing a Mao suit in untraditional electric blue. She air-kissed a Chinese television host and bantered with another guest in black velvet as TV cameras captured the exchange. In a corner, Pan chatted with the U.S. ambassador's wife.\n\nIn a country newly fascinated with glitz and glamor, Zhang and Pan have become something novel in China: a hot celebrity couple. They made their mark by building some of China's most successful office and housing complexes, defined by a simple, modern aesthetic. And they found fame thanks to an increasingly competitive media that pays attention to personalities, and a growing class of monied young professionals looking for role models.\n\nPan and Zhang \"are the `It Couple,'\" gushes Hung Huang, a publisher of trendy Chinese-language magazines who has run stories identifying Zhang as \"China's smartest woman.\"\n\nHung adds: \"They're self-made, they're creative and they're very good at feeling the pulse of the modern-day, middle-class Chinese.\"\n\nUnlike many other Chinese entrepreneurs, who prefer to keep a low profile, the couple have opened up their lives to the press. Their faces have appeared on the covers of many of China's new glossy magazines. Hundreds of articles have chronicled their rags-to-riches story and even their sometimes stormy relationship.\n\nMa Weiyan, a 28-year-old media entrepreneur, and her husband have bought two of the couple's properties for investment and a third for their own use. They devour any news about the couple.\n\n\"China has so many people with money,\" Ma shrugs. \"Why do we want to follow them? They don't just have money; they have taste.\"\n\nNot long ago, such renown would have been unthinkable in China. Most city dwellers lived in cramped, dingy apartments. Society frowned on individuals achieving wealth, not to mention publicizing it.\n\nWhen Zhang and Pan set up their own property company in 1995, they decided to market units based on Japan's \"Small Office, Home Office,\" or SOHO, concept, with homes doubling as offices. They named their company Soho China, evoking New York's Soho art district, a favorite locale of Zhang. The units had white walls, blond-wood floors and large windows, in contrast to the dark, empty concrete shells that most other developers were marketing.\n\n\"We sort of started the middle-class consciousness of lifestyle,\" says Zhang, 38. \"We pay a lot of attention to decorating details.\"\n\nWord-of-mouth over Soho's novel approach fueled sales, and potential buyers faced long wait lists. The couple went on to build the Commune by the Great Wall, a dozen avant-garde houses. One plays off the concept of a suitcase, where parts of the floor open up to reveal layers of space beneath. It won Zhang a special prize at the Venice Biennale, a prestigious international art festival.\n\nNeither of their upbringings offered any hint of a trendsetter future. Pan, 41, grew up in a village in the northwestern province of Gansu. He says his family was so poor that he sometimes had to beg for food.\n\nAfter graduating from vocational college in 1984, Pan headed to Hainan Island where he joined a group of young Chinese to launch a property company. In 1992, he moved to Beijing to set up a subsidiary, developing the city's first office building that sold space instead of renting it.\n\nZhang's parents worked as government translators in Beijing. They divorced when she was 15 and she moved with her mother to Hong Kong, where they worked in a series of sweatshops, she says. She studied economics at Sussex and Cambridge Universities in England and then went to Hong Kong to work in project financing for Goldman Sachs and Travelers Group. The jobs took her often into China, where she met Pan.\n\nToday Londy Ong, social editor of Beijing Tatler and a regular on Beijing's party circuit, labels their followers \"nouveau riche.\" But that didn't stop the lifestyle and society magazine from running an article on who wore what dress at a recent party hosted by the couple.\n\nThe couple's efforts to court the press have occasionally backfired, such as when a U.S. film crew followed Zhang around for a day, trailing her at one of her fancy parties. Then the filmmakers spliced scenes from her life into a program about the wealth disparity in China. It ran on PBS several years ago.\n\nThey are skillful at deflecting criticism. When some Soho residents grumbled in 1998 about an acrid smell in their new apartments from the concrete that had been used, the couple turned the incident into an opportunity for debate on quality problems plaguing the whole industry."
In Pakistan, underground parties push the boundaries\n\nAugust 20, 2012|Anam Zehra | Reuters\n\nISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Women in short skirts and men with gelled hair bump and grind on a dance floor as a disc jockey pumps up the volume. The air is thick with illicit smoke and shots of hard liquor are being passed around. Couples cuddle and kiss in a lounge.\n\nThis is not Saturday night at a club in New York, London or Paris. It is the secret side of Pakistan, a Muslim nation often described in the West as a land of bearded, Islamic hardmen and repressed, veiled women.\n\nPakistan was created out of Muslim-majority areas in colonial India 65 years ago, and for decades portrayed itself as a progressive Islamic nation. Starting in the 1980s, however, it has been drifting towards a more conservative interpretation of Islam that has reshaped the political landscape, fuelled militancy and cowed champions of tolerance into silence.\n\nBut the country remains home to a large wealthy and Westernized elite that, in private, lives very differently.\n\nEvery weekend, fashion designers, photographers, medical students and businessmen gather at dozens of parties in Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore to push social boundaries in discreet surroundings that would horrify, and enrage, advocates of the stricter brand of Islam.\n\n\"This is just epic,\" said Numair Shahzada, bobbing his head to the beat at a party in a farmhouse outside Islamabad as fitness instructors moonlighting as bouncers looked on. \"The light and smoke show is phenomenal.\"\n\nYoung men and women mix freely, dancing, talking or drinking. Some curl up together in quiet areas.\n\nAlthough alcohol is prohibited in the country, many have brought their own liquor. Whisky is carried in paper bags and vodka is disguised in water bottles arranged along the dance floor.\n\nThe party-goers form only a tiny minority of the country's 180 million people, but overall, Pakistan is not repressive. Women can drive, are enrolled in universities and have played prominent roles in politics. Unmarried men and women can interact without risking the wrath of religious police.\n\nPeople from its most populous province, Punjab, are renowned for their exuberance.\n\nBut a conservative form of Islam is chipping away at the tolerance.\n\nA few hours drive from Islamabad's party circuit, parts of remote tribal regions have fallen under the sway of hardline Taliban militants, who dream of toppling the U.S.-backed government and creating a society where revelers would face flogging, or worse.\n\n\"Men and women who dance together are damned by God. Whenever we see such displays of vulgarity we will definitely make them a target,\" said a senior Taliban commander.\n\nNews reports have said a tribal council in a village near the Afghanistan border ordered four women killed earlier this year for clapping and singing as men danced at a wedding. The Supreme Court has ordered an investigation, but there have been no further details.\n\n\nWhile the vast majority of Pakistanis abhor the Taliban's violence, there are many who share their belief that Islam should be Pakistan's guiding force. Religious parties, which do poorly at the polls but exert considerable sway over public debate, believe Islam should govern all spheres of life.\n\n\"It's so messed up,\" said Myra, a 23-year-old Pakistani who has dyed her hair reddish-brown.\n\n\"You see the servants and the drivers at the parties watching you and you wonder what kind of a person they think you are.\"\n\nTo avoid prying eyes, the kind of alcohol-fuelled blow-outs enjoyed by Myra and her friends are held in lonely farm-houses in the outskirts of Islamabad and other cities, or in affluent neighborhoods behind high walls. Organizers charge on average a $60 entry fee, an amount most Pakistanis earn in a month.\n\nRafia, petite with long, black hair and wearing tight jeans and a low-cut black blouse, is a regular on the party scene.\n\nShe frowns on women who carry secret cell phones unmonitored by their parents and wear revealing outfits under conservative dress that come off before getting on the dance floor.\n\n\"You can either be God-fearing or you can party,\" she said, taking a drag on a marijuana joint at a recent rave.\n\n\"I don't pray regularly and I usually stick to my fast. But at the end of the day, I don't say I am a very religious person.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees.\n\nBina Sultan, 40, an attractive fashion designer, showcases nude paintings and topless male models in shows. She also wears a silver pendant engraved with a verse from the Koran.\n\n\"People think I am shameless but I am actually very religious,\" she said at her studio, peppering her sentences with \"jaani\", Urdu for darling, while chain smoking.\n\n\"My faith is very strong. But everything I do is between my God and me.\"\n\n\nConservatism began sweeping through Pakistan during the military dictatorship of General Mohammad Zia ul-Haq in the 1980s under a drive to Islamize the state.\n\nZia's policies are widely blamed for a creeping culture of intolerance that has further isolated liberals."

How to drive away with the best offer\n\nNamrata Dadwal, ET Bureau Oct 1, 2012, 10.02AM IST\n(Car manufacturers and dealers\u2026)\n\nThe prices of essential items may be rising, but at least some things are getting cheaper. Car manufacturers and dealers are showering huge discounts to attract buyers. From cash rebates of up to Rs 60,000 to gold coins, the outpouring of gifts makes you believe that this festive season is truly fortuitous.\n\nManufacturers are hoping it will prove auspicious for them too, given the drop in sales in recent months. Car sales, which had slowed down after the budget, fell 18.1% in August, the first time in 10 months. In another first, there are discounts on diesel cars too.\n\nAlso check: Sensible driving can cut your fuel bill by 30%\n\nThe best part? The large inventory means there won't be any waiting period for your dream car. However, not every deal or discount offer is a golden opportunity. If you look carefully beneath the polished exterior and shiny hoods, you'll find that some of these are tarnished. In the following pages we tell you what to keep in mind when you go shopping for a car.\n\nAlso check: News on latest car launches and reviews\n\nWhich car should you buy?\n\nIf you stand in front of an auto showroom, you're back to feeling like a kid at the candy store. The various models, the gamut of options and trims, the wide colour spectrum\u2014each car seems more tempting than the other. However, you need to choose carefully since you will, hopefully, keep the car for at least five years, if not more.\n\nHere are five questions you should ask yourself before you buy your preferred car.\n\nWhat's your budget? All of us have a price range in mind when we go car shopping, but what you also need to remember is that the car is going to cost a lot more than the ex-showroom price stated in the brochure. There are sundry charges that you will need to pay. These may not seem too high individually, but add them up and they amount to 10-20% of the cost of the car, depending on the model.\n\nThese include mandatory charges, such as registration fee and road tax, or vague and arbitrary charges like logistics and handling fee (see box). Keep a margin since you may have to pay for a charge that you may not be aware of. For instance, if you register a car in Delhi, you have to pay an MCD parking charge of Rs 2,000 for cars worth less than Rs 4 lakh and Rs 4,000 for those priced higher.\n\nKeeping track of these extra charges is imperative if you aim to fund your purchase through a car loan since you may need to borrow more than you planned for. Commit to an EMI you can afford. Your total debt repayment should not exceed 30% of your monthly take-home pay. This includes repayment of any other loans as well as credit card payments. So, if your take-home salary is Rs 50,000, your combined EMIs should not be more than Rs 15,000.\n\nCan you afford the car you want? An SUV might look cool, but do you really need such a big car? The purchase price of the car is only the first cost you will incur. Over the next few years, you will spend a small fortune on fuel and maintenance, so you need to make sure that you buy the car you can afford in the long run. You may need to balance driving pleasure with your financial well-being. So, an automatic transmission vehicle may be more comfortable to drive, but it will also be more expensive and a heavy fuel guzzler compared with a manual transmission vehicle. (Read : Why you should think before buying an SUV)\n\u00a0 Obviously, the size of your family will be one of the deciding factors for choosing the size of the car, but if you are on a tight budget, you could perhaps forgo some of the options and trims. Would you really want to pay Rs 15,000 extra for a rear window defogger and music system? The only difference between two of the variants of the Toyota Etios Liva\u2014V and VX\u2014is that the latter has bumper skirts, a roof spoiler and audio controls on the steering wheel. Yet, the VX model costs Rs 6.2 lakh, almost Rs 50,000 more than its plainer cousin. Pay additional for safety features, but for 'beauty products', it may be better to buy a lower variant and add the trims you want later. This will certainly cost you much less.\n\nWhat fuels your desire? This is an oft-asked question that is tough to answer, mostly because the vacillating fuel prices keep buyers' brains spinning. So, though diesel is cheaper than petrol, the diesel cars are expensive by about Rs 1 lakh compared with their petrol variants. However, as we have often pointed out, the choice of fuel should depend on your usage.\n\nAlso check: Petrol car models more cost effective than diesel"

We think the board should say yes.\n\nThe old approach has served Southern California well during the first two decades of its pioneering fight for clean air. But times have changed. Because a more sophisticated tack on smog is within reach--partly because of new technology and partly because economic incentives have proved their value as enforcement tools--the new approach deserves a chance.\n\n\nWith few exceptions, both environmental activists and business spokesmen agree on the concept basic to the new phase--that the marketplace is a strong enough force to drive down air pollution. But they worry about details. The loose ends bother environmentalists because they don't want to take anything on faith when it comes to curbing pollution. They want evidence that the system would be enforceable and that the AQMD would not spend so much of its time putting the new system in place that it would let the old one fall apart.\n\nThe loose ends bother businesses in a different way. They want the freedom to experiment with new control equipment or with new and less polluting ways of doing business that the new system would offer. They can hardly wait to see whether projections hold up that it would save up to $1 billion a year in their cost for cleaning the air. And, in fact, the last thing they want is a haphazard experiment that would let pollution get out of control and cripple the notion of market incentives in clean air.\n\nThese are valid concerns, two of many about an experiment that has never been tried on such a grand scale anywhere in the United States. But the potential problems seem manageable. One reason is that environmental groups, independent economists, business people and government agencies have worked more closely on this project, and with more of their cards showing, than on any other in the history of the clean air movement. Another is that while the reasons differ, nobody disputes the need to guarantee that the new rules can be enforced and will cut smog, not just on paper but in the real world.\n\nHowever, permission to start drafting new rules is not a blank check. The rules must be written, examined and ratified by the policy board before they go into effect. Thus the board will keep firm control of the process.\n\n\nFor the 2,700 Southern California plants that account for 85% of the region's hydrocarbons and 95% of the nitrogen oxides that do not come from automobiles, the new approach involves two fundamental changes in the way pollution is controlled.\n\nUnder the old rules, the amount of pollution allowed from each generator, boiler, baking oven or other piece of equipment is generally specified by the smog-control agency, which accepts no substitutes.\n\nIn the future, a company could choose the least expensive mix of new controls as long as total pollution within an imaginary bubble encasing its property remained within permitted limits. Control hardware already in place would continue to operate.\n\nIn a second major change, the 2,700 companies would get certificates that showed how much pollution they could generate in the first year of the program.\n\nTo push Southern California air to higher standards, NOx emissions must drop by 8% a year and hydrocarbons by 5% a year for the next several years.\n\nPart of the pressure on industries and businesses to reduce emissions on schedule would come from the fact that each year the permits would allow less pollution.\n\nBecause these permits could be bought and sold on a kind of smog commodities market to give companies even more flexibility in the way they met standards, companies would have to cut emissions just to keep their \"stock\" from losing value on the market.\n\nThe credits could be used in several ways.\n\nA company that found an inexpensive way to slash its emissions to, say, half of what the law allowed would get credit for the difference between what it was allowed to emit and what it actually put into the air. It could then sell all or part of that difference to a firm that needed to cut emissions but also needed more time to develop new control technology.\n\nAlthough the first draft of the plan was still changing almost daily last week, as the plan now stands, restaurants, dry cleaners, sewage treatment plants, gasoline stations and other polluting businesses would operate under the old rules, at least in the early years of the new system.\n\n\nLos Angeles Times Articles", 
Playhouse 'Into The Woods' cast rises to Sondheim's musical challenge\n\nOctober 14, 2009|By Kathy Lauer-Williams OF THE MORNING CALL\n\nA talented cast of 23 does Stephen Sondheim proud in Pennsylvania Playhouse's version of the twisted fairy tale musical \"Into The Woods.\"\n\nThe modern parable, which showcases Sondheim's intricate melodies and complex lyrics, didn't daunt the many voices of the playhouse's cast, as words and music flew like aural darts throughout the 23/4-hour show.\n\nBacked by a small but effective orchestra, the show moved briskly under the direction of Rody Gilkeson.\n\nThe only quibble is that the actors could have been amplified more, since you need to hear every word clearly to appreciate Sondheim's humorous wordplay.\n\nIn the first act, the characters go through the familiar Grimm Fairy Tale storylines ending with \"happily ever after.\"\n\nThe darker second act explores the consequences of each character's actions -- some of which are dire -- as the characters lie, cheat, fight and even kill.\n\nAs the most human of the fairy tale characters, Richard Gunkle and Alicia Pfaff as the baker and his wife are believable as a desperate childless couple and endearing in their quest to break the spell that prevents them from having a child.\n\nPfaff is appealing and feisty, even when she gives in to her impulses, and shines on her musical numbers. Gunkle is heartbreaking on the wistful song \"No More,\" which he sings to his infant son.\n\nCinderella, played by Gwen Vigorito, displays her character's uncertainty. Her duet with Pfaff on \"A Very Nice Prince\" is one of the show's highlights.\n\nThe sets complement the storybook quality of the show by turning the stage into a lush forest with hidden glades and groves aided by evocative lighting.\n\nAs the two not-so-perfect princes charming, Hunter Chadeayne and Gregory Paradis are scene stealers in their hilarious duet \"Agony.\" They sing how the quest for love can be more fulfilling than what waits at the end.\n\nAndrea Cobb is effective as Red Riding Hood, who is not your typical sweet little girl. Traumatized by her experiences, she becomes an almost feral child who is quick to brandish her knife.\n\nJustin Doncsecz is charming as the naive Jack and Carole Silvoy brings her powerhouse voice to the role of Jack's mother.\n\nA standout in a small role is Paul Bonnici as Milky White the cow, who elicits many laughs with only the simple line \"moo.\"\n\nThe wolf is wonderfully wicked and oily as played by Michael Pesavento, who shines on \"Hello Little Girl.\"\n\nAs the witch, Elizabeth Marsh-Gilkeson is the voice of reason, although not always reasonable.\n\nKatie Meo's Rapunzel, not surprisingly, is a little unhinged after all those years in the tower.\n\n\"Into the Woods,\" Thursday through Sunday, and Oct. 23-25; 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays; 3 p.m. Sundays; tickets: $20, adults; $17 seniors and students. 610-865-6665 or\n\n\nMorning Call Articles",

It could also have been obscured\na cloud or mist. The apparent proximity of a new moon to apparent position of\nthe sun, and the glare from that adjacency makes observation of a \"newish moon\"\nvery difficult.\n\nNow, if you were watching a lunar eclipse, it would have looked a little different\nfrom a normal phase of the moon, and you could have seen the moon \"go out\".\nYou could have indeed seen this at sunset, opposite of the sun position.\n\nYou might make a point of watching the newest moon, soon after sunset, to see\nif you saw the same thing, and are perhaps misremembering it. You might also\nmake a point of watching lunar eclipses.\nposted by the Real Dan at 10:48 PM on October 23, 2009\n\nI agree that you probably saw the last waning sliver slip behind a cloud. The movement from that point to true new moon is much more gradual.\n\nMost calendars will tell you when full moon and new moon occur.\nposted by megatherium at 5:08 AM on October 24, 2009\n\nNope, I did not watch the last waning sliver slip behind a cloud. Also, not an eclipse. I watched the last waning sliver as it \"waned\" completely.\n\nThanks, 517, I'll try to watch at \"NOV. 16 19 14\"(-8 hours for my timezone) and hope for good weather.\nposted by Kickstart70 at 8:09 PM on October 24, 2009\n\nInteresting question! If it was a crescent moon, near the sun in the early evening, it couldn't have been an eclipse; eclipses happen when the moon is at opposition, and it's full. (You can see a lunar eclipse in the early evening, since lunar eclipses are visible from half the globe and it's always early evening somewhere. But a full moon in early evening is in the east.)\n\nThe \"instant\" of the new moon, which is what's tabulated by the Naval Observatory (already linked by 517), is the instant when the angle between the sun and the moon is the smallest for a given month. That minimum angle is not the same every month, though, because the plane of the earth-moon orbit is tilted relative to the ecliptic. Some months the moon gets no closer than 5\u00b0 to the sun, which is about ten moon diameters; some months the moon passes directly in front of the sun, which is a solar eclipse. This minimum angle also depends on where you are (otherwise you could see solar eclipses everywhere); I think the variation in the closest approach depending on your location is about one or two moon diameters, i.e. up to 1\u00b0.\n\nSo one unknown is, how close does the moon have to be to the sun for its edge to \"wink out\"? If it is, say, 7\u00b0, then this will be visible somewhere on the earth every new moon. If the winkout distance is, say, 2\u00b0, only some new moons will wink out, and then only from some observing locations. Observing location is another unknown, since a moon 5\u00b0 from the sun sets only 20 minutes after and is viisble in the twilight for much less than an hour.\n\nOH GOD DAMMIT, an early evening moon is WAXING (just like the Real Dan wrote yesterday), so it's getting bigger, not smaller. If you saw this moon in the early evening it was not waning. The waning moon would disappear just before dawn --- but it does that anyway, because the sun comes up. The waxing moon might suddenly appear as it gets far enough away from the sun --- but that's what happens as evening moves into twilight. So what you are describing is basically impossible to see. It was probably some sort of faint cloud.\n\nI define eponysterical.\nposted by fantabulous timewaster at 10:41 PM on October 24, 2009 [1 favorite]\n\nY'know...I remember the faded light, perhaps it WAS morning, on my walk to work.

Is that just magical thinking?). I also am wondering about unencrypted iOS backups--would there be a way to extract anything from them? Can you pull anything out of a Spotlight index?<br> <br> I'll probably add a screen saver / wake from sleep password, but I know that doesn't secure data, just the most casual snoops (target disk mode, password resets, etc.).<br> <br> TL;DR: assume I'm an average Mac user who's been lazy about security (using Keychain, \"keep me logged in\" status on Gmail and other web sites), no password to access, no encrypted data other than in 1Password). <strong>Please tell me anything I need to delete, update, uncheck, install, opt out of, opt into, or buy to make my Macs locked down <em>tight</em>.</strong> I don't mind spending money, I don't mind inconvenience. <br> <br> If my Macs were lost or stolen, I don't want to give one second's thought to the security of sensitive data or backdoors through email or Keychain or iOS backups or whatever.

You've probably seen these e-mails as To:undisclosed recipients, but when you look at the details it is because the To: field is blank. I'm quite familiar with creating gmail filters, but I just can't figure out what to put in the search box to make gmail look for To: fields with 'nothing' in them and every tutorial I've found online is about how to <em>send</em> e-mail like this, not filter out ones you receive. I've tried leaving all the search fields blank which finds all my e-mails, tried empty quotes and parenthesis, ie \"\" or () but it still returns all e-mails, and I've tried typing in \"undisclosed recipients\" but it didn't find these e-mails (unless those words were actually written in the To: field).

I have a determined and intelligent stalker. This person blasts my domain with harassing messages. I have tried the official methods for e-mail blocking, but found them unsatisfying. Typically, as on GMail, you filter addresses into the Trash. But then they sit there for days, and I don't want that, because I check my Trash for other messages.<br> <br> I have also tried the \"fake bounce\" method, which just caused this person to send taunting messages for months along the lines of \"Since you've blocked my e-mail, I can write anything I want! haha.\"<br> <br> What I dream of is a hardcore solution. Maybe something at the server level. Something that will kill these messages before they even reach my inbox. Routing them through some UNIX/procmail thing somehow !? I will learn how to build a new mail server if that is what it takes.<br> <br> I'm on Dreamhost using Google Apps on my business domain.

Some PINE thing like in college, where I can run a script that deletes spam, before it reaches me? Or does one of the major Web mail services just do this?<br> <br> The closest thing I have found to what I want is a vestigial Bounce feature in Apple Mail, but relying on that forces me to retreat from GMail (and therefore GChat).

I can't switch e-mail addresses, either, for business reasons.

After reading <a href=\"\">this</a> AskMe, I decided to use Mac's Mail program to keep copies of my messages on my gmail account on my computer. However, I wanted to use the \"IMAP\" option to keep copies of all my mail both on the web, in gmail, and on my computer, in Mac Mail. Instead, something else happened and now I'm in trouble. If I understand the distinction between \"POP\" and \"IMAP\" correctly, it seems that Mail configured my Gmail account in \"POP\" format automatically when I set things up, so that it downloaded my messages from my Gmail account and then deleted them from web-based Gmail. Now, when I log into gmail on the web, I can't see or access any of my messages. <br> <br> I've tried to reconfigure my preferences on Mail for IMAP, but Mail doesn't give you the option of changing an account from POP to IMAP (under \"Account Information,\" it says, \"Account Type: Gmail POP\" and there's no option to change it). You can change the incoming and outgoing mail servers, but I tried this and it doesn't seem to change anything.<br> <br> I thought about deleting my current mail account from Mail and then setting it up again, but when I tried to do so Mail gave me a warning message saying all my messages would be deleted. <br> <br> How can I undo my mistake and get my mail back on the web?

I have everything almost to where I want it, with one glaring exception: the 10,000 messages in my \"Sent\" folder in<br> <br> Here was my POP-era behavior: Send a message, remove it from the \"Sent\" folder and put it in the \"Family 2009\" folder or what have you.

Sometimes, a few messages would accumulate in the \"Sent\" folder until I filed them. All was well.<br> <br> Now, I have those same folders on my desktop app and would like to maintain the same behavior. . . except that \"Sent\" now mirrors what is on Gmail itself, which is to say it contains 10,000+ messages \u2014 every message since I started using Gmail. The thing is, I already <i>have</i> those messages filed away in their respective folders. And, while I could just erase them, I do not wish to <i>also</i> erase them from Gmail itself at the same time, because I like the idea that Gmail has every message incoming and outgoing archived.<br> <br> I want to get rid of that enormous Sent folder on while still having those messages on Gmail itself, and then I want all future sent messages to stay in the \"Sent\" mailbox in until I file them, at which time Gmail would archive them. <br> <br> God only knows if this makes any sense to anybody.

Overall the benefits are quite positive, but I'm having some usage issues that bug me. Can you help me use gmail better? Specific questions inside. <b>Part 1:</b> I love the benefit of the IMAP mail system, allowing my inbox to be anywhere I am, rather than centralized around a specific computer. Previously I had my POP work account for 3 years and amassed thousands of emails coming in at about 4GB, all of which I must keep for reference of correspondence, e-mail addresses, etc. I had my mail sorted into folders, about 30-40 different folders depending on correspondence type. All of that mail was in Outlook until I recently became a Mac convert. Now it's all in Thunderbird. <br> <br> So I can have ALL my mail available where I can get to it from anywhere, I'd like to migrate it all to GMail. I read that using IMAP I can just drag these old e-mails into my Inbox folder in Thunderbird, but given that I have about 40 folders, I'm not sure how to get them to GMail without just having a very large Inbox with a conglomeration of e-mails in it. I am guessing I could drag one folder to the Inbox, then organize that on Gmail, drag another folder, etc. but that leads me to problem #2:<br> <br> <b>Part 2:</b> I know GMail uses labels...are there no folders? Would I need to drag in the e-mails, then label them all to use GMail's label system instead of my current folder-based system? And is that the most efficient way to do this?<br> <br> <b>Part 3:</b> I am really NOT a fam of the \"message threading\" that GMail does. Often I will send solicitations to business partners and each subject line will be identical, the messages nearly so. However because the subject lines are the same, GMail takes e-mails from different business partners and puts them all in one thread, filling me with paranoia of sending the wrong e-mail to the wrong person or, worse, sending an entire e-mail chain from one business partner to another business partner which may contain confidential data. Is there any way to alter the functionality or, perhaps ideally, turn OFF this \"feature\" in GMail?<br> <br> <b>Part 4:</b> As I'm still new to GMail, any \"Power User\" tips for me?<br> <br> <b>Final Notes:</b> I still plan on using Thunderbird as my client of choice when at my work PC. I just want the ability to have ALL my mail accessible from ANY location as I feel it will enable me to work more efficiently, rather than having to hold some e-mails until I get back to my primary PC.<br> <br> Thanks for any suggestions!,2008:site.100355 Thu, 28 Aug 2008 12:25:14 -0800 Computers Email Gmail Google GoogleAps IMAP Internet Mail Novice Thunderbird User arniec Can Gmail 'redirect,' ala Can Gmail do something similar to the \"<a href=\"\" title=\"\">Redirect</a>\" feature in OS X's I'd like for my assistant to be able to Redirect (rather than Forward) time-sensitive messages that were sent to my public Gmail address.<br> <br> Redirected email (as it works in resends the exact/original message you received, changing only the \"To:\" address to whatever you like.

Take the tour \u00d7\n\nI'm in the process of setting up a new drive train. When using the smaller chainring and smallest sprocket (hence least amount of utilized chain), the chain brushes up against the bottom of the derailleur.\n\nShould I remove a link or two until this no longer happens?\n\nshare|improve this question\nadd comment\n\n3 Answers\n\nup vote 3 down vote accepted\n\nEdit: from your photos, yes, the chain is too long. In the large chainring-large cog photo it looks as though the derailleur arm could be pulled forward at least one chain link, possibly two.\n\nMy preferred method of finding chain length is to focus on the largest chainring-largest cog combination. If there's just barely enough chain for that everything will work, although the small-small combo may have a lot of slack. Park have an exhaustive explanation of various methods.\n\nToo much chain is kind of annoying, but too little can break things. Trying to shift into the large-large gear when there's not enough chain will stop your pedals, so there's a lot of force involved. Since you're going into a lower gear at that point, it often happens when you're pedalling hard. Hard enough to snap the chain in some cases. But also to snap the rear derailleur if it can't accomodate the position required, and if you're especially unlucky you might snap off the derailleur hanger as well. This breakage often throws the derailleur into your rear wheel which both breaks spokes and can dump you on the ground.\n\nbicycle rear derailleur with chain pulled into a Z shape to show excessWhat I suggest is shifting into the large-large combo and see if there is spare chain. Try pulling a link over itself so there's a wee Z formed in the chain. If you can do that there are extra links. Keep extending the Z until the rear derailleur seems unhappy, counting links. Now remove them. Remember you do need a little slack so you can get out of the gear - you're using the return spring in the rear derailleur to pull the chain off the biggest cog, and if there's too much chain tension it won't be able to do that. But as long as you can get into the gear you won't break anything (you just need to add a link back in, and maybe pull the wheel out to release the tension).\n\nThis ties into the \"some gears man was not meant to use\" discussion. In cross-over gears are the large-large and small-small ones, so called because the chain crosses over from one side of the crankset to the opposite side of the cassette. This causes extra friction and chain wear, and (almost always) those gears are duplicated elsewhere so there's no need to use them. So not being able to use the small-small combo because of slack chain should not normally be a problem.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThank you for your comprehensive explanation. However, I still feel a bit lost. The wee z seems a bit arbitrary for me to make a good decision, I'm not entirely sure what you mean by that though. Here are two photos which I would be grateful to have you take a look at. The first one is the large/large combo, the later is small/small. bigmapideas.com/other/1.jpg and bigmapideas.com/other/2.jpg \u2013\u00a0 user1480 May 12 '11 at 16:09\nI've edited and re-uploaded your picture to make it clear. Although I did edit the wrong picture, you should do this in the large-large gear not the small-small one pictured. \u2013\u00a0 \u041c\u05e1\u017e May 12 '11 at 21:46\nThanks for the extended effort, I understand what you mean now by the Wee Z and have everything working properly now. Cheers! \u2013\u00a0 user1480 May 13 '11 at 16:16\nadd comment\n\nAs always, Sheldon Brown has the authoritative explanation:\n\nThe best technique for setting chain length is to thread the chain onto the large/large combination, without running it through the rear derailer. Mesh the two ends on to the large chainwheel so that one complete link (one inch, -- one inner and one outer half-link) overlaps. In almost all cases, this will give the optimum length.\n\nStart with the shortest chain that would permit connection, allowing one extra complete link as shown in the photo at the left above, so the bottom of the chain droops if you align it as in the picture at the right. Then thread the chain through the rear derailer and connect it. Turning the crank by hand, check that the chain will shift to the large-large combination using the front derailer or rear derailer, or both at once, without binding.\n\nWork by shortening the chain, rather than lengthening it. Making the chain too short, then lengthening it is a time-waster. The narrowest chains, used with cassettes that have 10 sprockets -- sometimes 9 -- must be joined using special one-time-use replacement pins or master links. You probably only get one of these with a new chain, so it is important to get the length right on the first try.\n\nproper chain length\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThanks for that, however his explanation is incomplete. From the way it's written, it reads like you are merely removing one complete chain link from the current length. Should the chain be taught when doing this overlap? Well, no, then there wouldn't be enough chain to compensate for what's used by the derailleur. Sheldon usually has concise articles, this one is a bit misleading. I'm still lost :( \u2013\u00a0 user1480 May 12 '11 at 19:57\nIt should be taut, as you are doing this procedure with the chain around the large chainring and the large cog, which is a combination that should never occur while riding. Regardless of how long the chain is, reduce its length such that it overlaps by no more than one full inner / outer link pair. \u2013\u00a0 Stephen Touset May 12 '11 at 20:28\nI understand now, thanks! \u2013\u00a0 user1480 May 13 '11 at 16:14\nadd comment\n\nIf you are replacing just the chain (and not the sprockets or chainset) here is a tip for getting the chain length correct.\n\nTake the old chain off and hold it up with the new chain. Compare the length and remove 2-4 links so that the the two chains are of the 'same' length.\n\nSame ?\n\nChains wear, that wear means the chain appears to have stretched. Sometimes this 'stretch' can be minimal, at other times it can be as much as a link, or maybe more. Should the 'stretch' amount to a link's length then you are advised to replace the sprockets too. This is because they are also likely to be worn out.\n\nIf you are in the business of fixing bikes regularly then it is useful to have two small nails in the workshop, high up and above the metal recycling bin. In that way you can hook the old and new chains onto the nails and compare lengths that bit easier. When done you can then release the old chain straight into the bin, thereby minimizing dirt/grease/oil on one's hands.\n\nThis technique works, it also saves time and reduces the likelihood of getting the chain length wrong.\n\nshare|improve this answer\nThanks, I will do that in the future. This time I replaced the crank and derailleur so it wouldn't line up the same. \u2013\u00a0 user1480 May 20 '11 at 1:23\nadd comment\n\nYour Answer\n\n
