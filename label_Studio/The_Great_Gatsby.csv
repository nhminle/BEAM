Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.","Y, después de presumir así de mi tolerancia, me veo obligado a admitir que tiene un límite. Me da lo mismo, superado cierto punto, que la conducta se funde sobre piedra o sobre terreno pantanoso. Cuando volví del Este el otoño pasado, era consciente de que deseaba un mundo en uniforme militar, en una especie de vigilancia moral permanente; no deseaba más excursiones desenfrenadas y con derecho a privilegiados atisbos del corazón humano. La única excepción fue Gatsby, el hombre que da título a este libro: Gatsby, que representaba todo aquello por lo que siento auténtico desprecio. Si la personalidad es una serie ininterrumpida de gestos logrados, entonces había en Gatsby algo magnífico, una exacerbada sensibilidad para las promesas de la vida, como si estuviera conectado a una de esas máquinas complejísimas que registran terremotos a quince mil kilómetros de distancia. Tal sensibilidad no tiene nada que ver con esa sensiblería fofa a la que dignificamos con el nombre de «temperamento creativo»: era un don extraordinario para la esperanza, una disponibilidad romántica como nunca he conocido en nadie y como probablemente no volveré a encontrar. No: Gatsby, al final, resultó ser como es debido. Fue lo que lo devoraba, el polvo viciado que dejaban sus sueños, lo que por un tiempo acabó con mi interés por los pesares inútiles y los entusiasmos insignificantes de los seres humanos.","And, after boasting about my tolerance, I find myself forced to admit that it has a limit. I don't care, once a certain point is surpassed, whether the behavior is founded on stone or on swampy ground. When I returned from the East last autumn, I was aware that I desired a world in military uniform, in a kind of permanent moral vigilance; I no longer wanted wild excursions and privileged glimpses into the human heart. The only exception was Gatsby, the man who gives this book its title: Gatsby, who represented everything for which I feel genuine contempt. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something magnificent about Gatsby, an extraordinary sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were connected to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes from fifteen thousand kilometers away. Such sensitivity has nothing to do with the soft sentimentality that we dignify with the name of ""creative temperament"": it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in anyone else and probably never will again. No: Gatsby, in the end, turned out all right. It was what preyed on him, the foul dust that floated in the wake of his dreams, that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.",1696,48.462,4,"","Aligned 😊","Hoşgörümle bu kadar övündükten sonra bunun da bir sınırı olduğunu itiraf etmeliyim. İnsan davranışlarının altında sert bir kaya da olabilir, bataklık da ama bir noktadan sonra bunu pek de umursadığımı söyleyemem. Geçen sonbaharda ülkenin doğusundan döndüğümde dünyanın bir örnek ve üzerinde namusun sonsuza dek egemen olmasını istediğimi anlamıştım. İnsanların kalplerine ayrıcalıklı bakışlarla yapılan huzursuz gezintileri istemiyordum artık. Sadece bir tek kişiyi, bu kitaba da adını veren Gatsby’i bunların dışında tutuyorum. Gatsby, yani benim hor gördüğüm ne varsa kendinde toplayan kişi. Art arda sıralanan başarılı jestler kişi­liğin bir göstergesiyse Gatsby’de muhteşem bir şey, yaşamın vaatlerine karşı abartılı bir duyarlılık vardı. Binlerce kilometre ötedeki depremleri kaydedebilen karmaşık cihazlara benzerdi o. Ancak bunun “yaratıcı mizaç” adıyla yüceltilen o gevşek hassaslıkla hiç ilgisi yoktu. Onunki olağanüstü bir umut etme yeteneği, o ana dek kimsede görmediğim ve bir daha da göreceğimi sanmadığım romantik bir delilikti. Hayır - Gatsby en sonunda muradına erdi. İnsanların nafile hüzünlerine ve kısa ömürlü mutluluklarına duyduğum ilginin bir süreliğine kaybolmasına yol açan, Gatsby’i gafil avlayan, hayallerinden uyandığında onu kül ve toza bulayan şeydi.","After boasting so much about my tolerance, I must admit that it has its limits. There may be a hard rock or a swamp beneath human behaviors, but after a certain point, I can't say that I care much. When I returned from the east of the country last fall, I realized that I wanted the world to be an example and for honor to reign supreme forever. I no longer wanted those uneasy excursions into the privileged views of people's hearts. I exclude only one person from this, Gatsby, who also gives his name to this book. Gatsby, the person who embodies everything I despise. If a series of successful gestures is a sign of personality, Gatsby had something magnificent, an exaggerated sensitivity to life's promises. He was like those complex devices that can record earthquakes thousands of miles away. But this had nothing to do with that loose sensitivity glorified under the name of ""creative temperament."" His was an extraordinary ability to hope, a romantic madness that I had never seen before and don't think I will ever see again. No - Gatsby ultimately achieved his desire. It was what caught Gatsby off guard, what covered him in ash and dust when he awoke from his dreams, that caused my interest in the futile sorrows and short-lived happiness of people to disappear for a while.","2024-09-23T18:05:52.456465Z","Sau khi đã tự khoe khoang về tính kiên nhẫn của mình như thế, tôi cũng phải thú nhận rằng sự kiên nhẫn nhịn nhục của tôi thật ra có giới hạn. Hạnh kiểm của con người có thể được xây dựng trên nền đá cứng hay trên mặt đầm lầy, tuy nhiên đến một mức nào đó thì tôi không còn cần quan tâm xem nó đã được xây trên nền tảng nào. Mùa thu năm ngoái khi tôi quay trở về nhà từ miền Đông, tôi cảm thấy tôi muốn cả thế giới đều mặc quân phục và muốn họ mãi mãi đứng trong hàng quân với tư thế nghiêm chỉnh đạo đức. Tôi không còn muốn những cuộc giải trí náo động ồn ào với cái đặc quyền được nhìn thoáng vào trong tim của con người ta nữa. Chỉ có Gatsby, người mà tôi đã lấy tên để đặt cho quyển sách này được coi là ngoại lệ trong phản ứng của tôi. Gatsby là người đại diện cho mọi thứ mà tôi khi bỉ. Nếu như bản tính con người là những chuỗi thể hiện thành công liên tục của họ, như thế thì anh ta quả thật là tốt đẹp. Với những nhạy cảm cao độ có thể cảm nhận được tương lai, anh ta giống những bộ máy phức tạp có thể ghi nhận được những trận động đất cách sâu cả vạn dặm. Phản ứng nhạy cảm này của anh không liên quan gì tới cái khả năng nhạy cảm yếu đuối ủy mị đáng kính trọng dưới cái từ ""tính khí sáng tạo"". Nó chỉ là một năng khiếu về sự hy vọng hiếm có, một tư thế sẵn sàng đầy tính lãng mạn mà tôi chưa bao giờ thấy ở bất cứ ai và cũng có thể sẽ không bao giờ tìm được. Kết cục Gatsby lại là người tốt, chính cái đã dày vò ám ảnh Gatsby, chính cái lớp bụi bẩn thỉu bay lơ lửng bên trên giấc mơ vừa tỉnh giấc của anh đã tạm thời khép lại sự quan tâm hứng thú của tôi về những nỗi đau buồn và những niềm vui ngắn ngủi của con người.","After boasting about my patience like that, I must also confess that my patience for enduring has its limits. Human conduct can be built on solid rock or on a swampy foundation, but at some point, I no longer care what it was built on. Last autumn, when I returned home from the East, I felt that I wanted the whole world to wear uniforms and to forever stand in ranks with moral uprightness. I no longer wanted noisy, boisterous entertainments with the privilege of glimpsing into people's hearts. Only Gatsby, the person whose name I used for this book, was an exception to my reaction. Gatsby represented everything I scorned. If human nature is a series of successful expressions, then he was indeed admirable. With a heightened sensitivity that could perceive the future, he was like a complex machine capable of recording earthquakes from thousands of miles away. This sensitivity of his had nothing to do with the weak, sentimental sensitivity respected under the term ""creative temperament."" It was merely a rare gift for hope, a romantic readiness that I have never found in anyone else and probably never will. In the end, Gatsby was good, and it was precisely what tormented and haunted Gatsby, the filthy dust that floated above his awakened dreams, that temporarily closed my interest in the sorrows and short-lived joys of people."

Qua khoé mắt của mình, Gatsby nhìn thấy những những viên đá lát hè đường đang chuyển mình xếp lên nhau biến thành chiếc thang dựng leo lên tới một chỗ bí mật nào đó trên đỉnh những ngọn cây. Nếu như một mình, anh có thể trèo lên nó. Một khi đã lên tới nơi, anh có thể mút lấy cái núm vú của cuộc đời và nuốt chửng từng ngụm lớn dòng sữa diệu kỳ vô sánh.","One autumn night five years ago, the two of them walked side by side on the street under the falling leaves. They walked to a place without trees and the whole sidewalk lit up under the moonlight. They stopped there facing each other. The cool evening contained mysterious stirrings that came only twice a year at the change of seasons. The gentle light from the houses softly spread out into the darkness, and there was something like a tremor, like a stir among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye, Gatsby saw the paving stones of the sidewalk shifting, stacking up to form a ladder reaching to some secret place atop the trees. If he were alone, he could climb it. Once at the top, he could suck on the nipple of life and gulp down great draughts of its incomparable milk."
