Tôi thích thú biết rằng thông điệp cấm của cô đã vượt qua, tới được ít nhất một con người khác, khi đặt vào dán mình lên vách tủ tôi, đã được tôi mở ra và đọc. Đôi lúc tôi lặp lại từng chữ cho mình. Chúng mang lại một niềm vui nho nhỏ. Khi tưởng tượng người đàn bà đã viết dòng này, tôi mường tượng cô ta khoảng tuổi tôi, có thể trẻ hơn chút ít. Tôi biến cô thành Moira, Moira của thời đại học, ở phòng kế tôi: nhỏng nhảnh, hoạt bát, vận động viên cưỡi xe đạp một thời, và ba lô chuyên đổ đi bộ đường dài. Lắm tàn nhang, tôi hình dung; ưa nhạo báng, nhiều mưu lược.","Thinking about this message secretly amused me. I was amused to think that I was communicating with her, the secret woman. For she was indeed a secret, or if known at all, no one had ever mentioned her to me. I was delighted to know that her forbidden message had passed through, reaching at least one other person, when placed and stuck on my locker door, had been opened and read by me. Sometimes I repeated each word to myself. They brought a small joy. When imagining the woman who wrote this line, I pictured her around my age, maybe a little younger. I turned her into Moira, Moira from college, in the room next to mine: playful, lively, a former cyclist, and a backpacker who often went hiking. Freckled, I imagined; fond of mocking, full of schemes."

Helping each other with daily tasks while holding hands on life's journey, each with her own duty. Why demand a single woman to perform all the duties to keep the household running smoothly?

We are advocating for each of you to have a small garden, your own - remember, holding hands tightly, voice as light as a breath - and that's just one example. A finger raised to scold us.
