Voy entre estos últimos, que aseguran ser descendientes de Atila y los hunos. Esto puede ser cierto, puesto que cuando los magiares conquistaron el país, en el siglo XI, encontraron a los hunos, que ya se habían establecido en él. Leo que todas las supersticiones conocidas en el mundo están reunidas en la herradura de los Cárpatos, como si fuese el centro de alguna especie de remolino imaginativo; si es así, mi estancia puede ser muy interesante.

Có lẽ điều này là có thật bởi vì vào thế kỷ thứ mười hai, khi người Magyard đi chinh phục xứ sở mà hiện nay họ đang sống, thì người Hung đã sinh cơ lập nghiệp ở đó rồi. Dường như mọi mê tín dị đoan trên thế giới đều có ở vùng Carpates, và tất cả luôn làm khuấy động trí tưởng tượng của dân gian. Nếu thực tế đúng là như vậy, thì những ngày nghỉ lại xứ này của tôi chắc sẽ rất thú vị.

I will stay with the Szekelys. It is said that they descend from Attila and are the descendants of the Huns. This might be true because in the twelfth century, when the Magyars conquered the land they now inhabit, the Huns had already settled there. It seems that all the superstitions in the world exist in the Carpathians, and they always stir the imagination of the local people. If this is indeed the case, then my stay in this land will surely be very interesting. (I will certainly always bother the count with questions about these superstitious beliefs)."

This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his hand in silence.

Dù vô cùng kinh ngạc, nhưng điều đó đã giúp tôi khẳng định chắc chắn một điều mà từ khi đặt chân đến lâu đài này đến giờ tôi vẫn nghi ngờ: trong nhà không có người giúp việc. Và lát sau, khi nhìn qua khe cửa, thấy lão đang bày bàn ăn trong phòng ăn, thì tôi chẳng còn gì để mà nghi ngờ nữa, bởi nếu lão có đảm nhận những việc này, thì chẳng qua là lão không có người hầu làm giúp. Tôi rùng mình hoảng sợ khi nghĩ rằng nếu trong lâu đài không còn bất cứ một ai khác, thì gã đánh xe ngựa đón tôi đến đây cũng chính là lão chứ không phải ai khác. Nếu đó đúng là sự thật, thì cái quyền lực mà lão đã làm bằng cách giơ bàn tay lên để buộc đàn sói phải tuân lệnh sẽ nói lên điều gì? Tại sao những người dân ở khách sạn Bistritz và tất cả những người bạn đồng hành trên chiếc xe ngựa đầu tiên lại luôn lo sợ cho tôi đến như vậy? Tại sao họ lại tặng tôi cây thánh giá nhỏ, rồi một nhánh tỏi và cả bông hồng dại nữa? Cầu Chúa hãy ban phước lành cho người đàn bà đôn hậu đã tặng tôi chuỗi hạt có cây thánh giá?

Tôi rất ngạc nhiên khi thấy cây thánh giá, một vật vô tri vô giác, một vật mà tôi vẫn cho là vô dụng bấy lâu nay, một vật chỉ được xem là biểu tượng của tín ngưỡng, lại ít nhiều cứu giúp tôi khỏi cái cảm giác đơn côi và cùng quẫn. Cây thánh giá nhỏ ấy có một quyền năng nội tại, hay chỉ là một vật làm sống lại những kỷ niệm xưa cũ? Tôi hy vọng là có một ngày, tôi sẽ kiểm nghiệm được vấn đề để đưa ra một lời giải đáp. Trong lúc chờ đợi, tôi buộc phải nắm bắt càng rõ về con người bá tước Dracula càng tốt có thể điều đó sẽ giúp tôi hiểu rõ nhất mọi chuyện đang xảy ra.

And a moment later, when I looked through the crack in the door and saw him setting the dining table in the dining room, I had no more doubts, for if he was taking on these tasks, it was simply because he had no servants to do them for him. I shuddered in fear at the thought that if there was no one else in the castle, the coachman who brought me here was none other than the old count himself. If that were true, what would it say about the power he wielded by raising his hand to command the wolves? Why were the people at the Bistritz hotel and all my fellow travelers on the first coach so fearful for me? Why did they give me a small cross, a sprig of garlic, and a wild rose? May God bless the kind-hearted woman who gave me the rosary with the cross? For every time I touch that cross, I feel as if I am imbued with strength and courage. I was very surprised to see that the cross, an inanimate object, something I had long considered useless, merely a symbol of faith, could somewhat save me from feelings of loneliness and despair. Does that small cross have an intrinsic power, or is it merely an object that revives old memories? I hope that one day, I will be able to test the matter to provide an answer. In the meantime, I must grasp as much as possible about Count Dracula; perhaps it will help me understand everything that is happening. And perhaps tonight he will reveal many things if I steer the conversation in this direction. However, I must also be very cautious so that he cannot suspect my inner thoughts."

Her lips were parted, and she was breathing—not softly as usual with her, but in long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every breath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the collar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck, for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air, unclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to have my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her throat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began very gently to wake her.

At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly, till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.

Onu birdenbire uyandırmaktan korktum, bu yüzden ellerimi boşaltıp ona yardım edebileyim diye şalı büyük bir çengelli iğneyle boğazında tutturdum; ama kaygıdan beceriksizce davranıp iğneyi boğazına batırmış ya da saplamış olmalıyım çünkü çok geçmeden, nefes alışı sakinleştiğinde elini bir kez daha boğazına götürüp inledi. Onu dikkatlice sarıp sarmaladığımda ayakkabılarımı ayaklarına geçirdim ve sonra onu yavaşça uyandırmaya başladım. Önce tepki vermedi, ama uykusunda ara sıra inleyerek ve iç çekerek giderek daha huzursuzlaştı. Zaman hızla akıp geçtiği için ve başka pek çok nedenden ötürü onu bir an önce eve götürmek istiyordum; sonunda gözlerini açıp uyanana kadar onu büyük güçle sarstım. Elbette, hemen nerede olduğunu anlamadığı için beni gördüğüne şaşırmış gibi görünmüyordu. Lucy hep çok güzel uyanır ve böyle bir zamanda, bedeni soğuktan üşümüşken, zihni gece vakti kilise bahçesinde üzerinde giysileri olmadan uyanmış olmasının etkisiyle biraz dehşete kapılmışken bile zarafetini yitirmedi. Biraz titredi ve bana sarıldı; hemen benimle eve gelmesini söylediğimde söz dinleyen çocuk gibi tek söz söylemeden ayağa kalktı. Yürürken, çakıltaşları ayaklarımı acıttı ve Lucy acıyla yüzümü buruşturduğumu fark etti. Durdu ve ayakkabılarımı almam için ısrar etmek istedi, ama kabul etmedim. Ama fırtınadan kalan bir gölcüğün olduğu kilise bahçesinin dışındaki keçiyoluna çıktığımızda ayaklarımı sırayla diğerinin üzerine basarak ikisini de çamura buladım, böylece, eve giderken biriyle karşılaşmamız durumunda kimse çıplak ayaklarımın farkına varmayacaktı.","When I leaned over, I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips were parted and she was breathing - not softly as usual, but with long, deep breaths as if she wanted to fill her lungs completely with each inhale. When I approached her, she raised her hand in her sleep and wrapped the collar of her nightgown around her neck. As she did this, she shivered slightly as if she felt the cold. I threw a warm shawl over her and fastened the edges tightly around her neck because I was afraid she might catch a bad chill in the night air while she was so exposed. I was afraid of waking her suddenly, so I secured the shawl around her neck with a large safety pin to free my hands and help her; but in my anxious clumsiness, I must have pricked or stuck her with the pin because soon after, as her breathing calmed, she brought her hand to her neck and groaned once more. Once I had carefully wrapped her up, I put my shoes on her feet and then began to wake her gently. At first, she did not respond, but she became increasingly restless, occasionally groaning and sighing in her sleep. Time was passing quickly, and for many other reasons, I wanted to get her home as soon as possible; finally, I shook her with great effort until she opened her eyes and woke up. Of course, she did not seem surprised to see me because she did not immediately understand where she was. Lucy always wakes up beautifully, and even at such a time, when her body was chilled from the cold and her mind was somewhat horrified by waking up in the churchyard at night without her clothes, she did not lose her grace. She shivered a little and hugged me; when I told her to come home with me immediately, she stood up without saying a word, like an obedient child. As we walked, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed the pained expression on my face. She stopped and wanted to insist that I take my shoes back, but I refused. But when we reached the goat path outside the churchyard, where there was a puddle left from the storm, I stepped into the mud with one foot after the other, so that if we encountered anyone on the way home, no one would notice my bare feet.","2024-09-24T17:11:17.733471Z","Lucy đang ngủ rất say, đôi môi hé mở, nhịp thở không êm ái như mọi khi. Dường như cô đang gắng sức với những nhịp thở khó nhọc để có thể hít không khí vào trong lồng ngực. Cô khẽ cựa quậy rồi kéo cao chiếc áo ngủ lên kín cổ trong trạng thái vô thức. Tôi chợt nhận thấy cô đang lạnh run từ đầu xuống chân. Tôi lấy chiếc khăn len của mình nhẹ nhàng quấn vào cổ bạn. Tuy nhiên, hình như bàn tay vụng về vì sợ hãi của tôi đã chọc mạnh vào cổ cô thì phải, vì sau đó tôi thấy cô đưa tay lên xoa cổ và khẽ rên lên một tiếng. Chiếc móng tay để dài ngoằng của tôi đã làm cô đau, song không vì thế mà cô tỉnh dậy. Sau khi xỏ vào chân bạn đôi giày của mình, tôi mới dám nhẹ nhàng đánh thức cô dậy. Cô lại khẽ rên một tiếng và trút một hơi thở thật dài, nhưng vẫn không hề động đậy thêm một chút nào. Nhận thấy một ngày mới đang sắp đến như vậy sẽ không tiện cho việc dẫn Lucy về khách sạn tôi buộc phải lay cô bạn mạnh hơn một chút. Cuối cùng thì cô cũng mở mắt tỉnh dậy, nhưng không hề tỏ vẻ ngạc nhiên khi trông thấy tôi, rõ ràng là cô vẫn chưa biết mình đang ở đâu. Lúc mơ màng tỉnh dậy, trông Lucy vẫn xinh đẹp như thường. Kể cả khi cô vừa trải qua một đêm tối lạnh lẽo run người giữa một bãi tha ma hoang vắng, và trên người chỉ có độc nhất một chiếc áo ngủ, trông cô vẫn không mất đi cái vẻ duyên dáng yêu kiều. Tỉnh dậy rồi mà người cô vẫn run run. Khi tôi bảo: “Về nhà ngay với tớ đi”, cô chỉ lẳng lặng đứng dậy và ngoan ngoãn vâng lời như một đứa trẻ. Trên đường về, sỏi đá đã làm đôi chân tôi trầy máu. Thấy vậy cô đã dừng lại nài nỉ tôi xỏ chân vào đôi giày mà tôi đã nhường cho cô. Tất nhiên là tôi không đồng ý. Ra khỏi nghĩa địa, tôi phải nhúng cả hai chân xuống bùn để khi có người bắt gặp họ sẽ không phát hiện ra tôi đang đi chân đất.","Lucy was sleeping very soundly, her lips slightly parted, her breathing not as smooth as usual. It seemed she was struggling with labored breaths to draw air into her chest. She stirred slightly and unconsciously pulled her nightgown up to cover her neck. I suddenly noticed she was shivering from head to toe. I gently wrapped my woolen scarf around her neck. However, it seemed my clumsy, frightened hand had jabbed her neck, as I saw her raise her hand to rub her neck and let out a soft moan. My long fingernail had hurt her, but she did not wake up because of it. After putting my shoes on her feet, I dared to gently wake her up. She let out another soft moan and exhaled deeply, but did not move any further. Realizing that a new day was approaching, which would make it inconvenient to take Lucy back to the hotel, I had to shake her a bit more firmly. Finally, she opened her eyes, but did not show any surprise upon seeing me, clearly still unaware of where she was. Even in her drowsy state, Lucy looked as beautiful as ever. Even though she had spent a cold, shivering night in a desolate graveyard, wearing only a nightgown, she had not lost her graceful charm. Even after waking up, she was still trembling. When I said, ""Let's go home right away,"" she silently stood up and obediently followed like a child. On the way back, the gravel had bloodied my feet. Seeing this, she stopped and insisted that I put on the shoes I had given her. Of course, I refused. Upon leaving the cemetery, I had to dip both feet in mud so that if anyone saw us, they wouldn't notice I was barefoot."

Antes de quedarse dormida me pidió, me imploró, que no dijese una palabra a nadie, ni siquiera a su madre, de lo que había pasado aquella noche.

I immediately realized that in his madness, he could become very dangerous, so I cautiously stepped back, intending to use the wooden table as a barrier between him and me. But he was quicker than I was; before I could regain my balance, he had already slashed my left wrist quite deeply. However, not allowing him to swing the knife a second time, I immediately lunged at him, pushing him flat onto the floor. Blood from the wound on my hand pooled into a small puddle on the carpet. Renfield remained lying still, seemingly not intending to attack again. It was only then that I had time to bandage my wound while keeping my eyes fixed on the patient. When the attendants arrived, we gathered around to lift him up and push him back to his room, but he started thrashing and suddenly turned around to do something that astonished me once again: he crawled on the floor like a dog and licked up the blood that had just dripped from my wound.

En algún lugar cercano, una campana doblaba; todos los perros de la vecindad estaban aullando, y en nuestros arbustos, aparentemente muy cercanos, cantaba un ruiseñor. Yo estaba aturdida y embotada de dolor, terror y debilidad, pero el sonido del ruiseñor pareció la voz de mi madre muerta que regresaba para consolarme. Los ruidos parece que también despertaron a las sirvientas, pues pude oír sus pisadas descalzas corriendo fuera de mi puerta. Las llamé y entraron, y cuando vieron lo que había sucedido, y qué era lo que descansaba sobre mí en la cama, dieron gritos. El viento irrumpió a través de la rota ventana y la puerta se cerró de golpe. Levantaron el cuerpo de mi amada madre y la acostaron, cubriéndola con una sábana, sobre la cama, después de que yo me hube levantado. Estaban tan asustadas y nerviosas que les ordené fueran al comedor a tomar cada una un vaso de vino. La puerta se abrió de golpe unos instantes y luego se cerró otra vez. Las sirvientas gritaron horrorizadas, y luego se fueron en grupo compacto al comedor, y yo puse las flores que había tenido alrededor de mi cuello sobre el pecho de mi querida madre. Cuando ya estaban allí recordé lo que me había dicho el doctor van Helsing, pero no quise retirarlas, y, además, alguna de las sirvientas podría sentarse conmigo ahora. Me sorprendió que las criadas no regresaran. Las llamé, pero no obtuve respuesta, por lo que bajé al comedor a buscarlas.","It did not seem to take long, but rather it was very, very terrible, until I could regain consciousness again. Somewhere nearby, a bell was tolling; all the neighborhood dogs were howling, and in our bushes, seemingly very close, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and dulled by pain, terror, and weakness, but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother returning to comfort me. The noises also seemed to wake the maids, as I could hear their bare footsteps running outside my door. I called them and they came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what was lying on me in the bed, they screamed. The wind burst through the broken window and the door slammed shut. They lifted the body of my beloved mother and laid her, covering her with a sheet, on the bed after I had gotten up. They were so scared and nervous that I ordered them to go to the dining room and each have a glass of wine. The door burst open for a few moments and then closed again. The maids screamed in horror, and then they went in a tight group to the dining room, and I placed the flowers I had had around my neck on my dear mother's chest. When they were already there, I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing had told me, but I did not want to remove them, and besides, one of the maids could sit with me now.

Khi tôi tỉnh táo trở lại, âm thanh đầu tiên vẳng đến tai tôi là tiếng chuông cầu hồn ngân xa, rồi tiếp đó là tiếng chó sủa xung quanh ngôi nhà, và trong các bụi cây giữa vườn, không xa cửa sổ phòng tôi, còn vọng tới những tiếng hót lảnh lót của một con sơn ca. Nỗi ưu phiền, sự sợ hãi, tình trạng sức khỏe suy sụp nghiêm trọng, tất cả như cùng hùa tới một lúc khiến người tôi đờ ra như một kẻ chết rồi. Tuy nhiên, nghe thấy tiếng hót của chim sơn ca, tôi có cảm giác như được nghe thấy giọng nói thân thương của mẹ tôi, giọng nói dịu dàng cất lên giữa đêm tối để an ủi tôi. Chắc hẳn chuỗi tiếng động lạ tai đã làm những người hầu trong nhà thức giấc, bởi tới nghe rất rõ bước chân trần của họ nhẹ bước trên chiếu nghỉ cầu thang. Nghe tiếng tôi gọi phều phào, họ bước nhanh vào phòng. Tất cả cùng kêu rú lên sợ hãi, khỏi phải nhắc lại họ đã khiếp đảm như thế nào khi hiểu ra nỗi bất hạnh đã xảy đến với chúng tôi và trông thấy mẹ tôi nằm đè lên người tôi. Cơn gió lùa vào qua ô cửa vỡ làm cho cửa phòng thỉnh thoảng lại nghiến ken két. Những cô gái can đảm xúm lại đỡ mẹ tôi sang một bên để tôi có thể ngồi dậy. Biết họ đang rất xúc động, tôi bảo họ nên xuống phòng ăn làm một hớp rượu vang cho bình tĩnh trở lại. Họ mở cửa rồi lại đóng sập lại ngay sau khi bước chân ra khỏi phòng. Tôi còn nghe thấy tiếng họ thốt lên một lần nữa, rồi tiếp đó là tiếng những bước chân lao vội vã xuống cầu thang. Lúc này, tôi chẳng còn biết làm gì ngoài việc đau đớn nhặt những bông hoa đặt lên ngực mẹ tôi và hồi tưởng lại những lời dặn bảo của giáo sư Van Helsing, nhưng nhớ chỉ là để nhớ thôi, chứ tôi cũng chẳng cần tới những bông hoa này làm gì nữa. Tôi sốt ruột đợi đám người hầu quay trở lại: chúng tôi sẽ cùng thức bên nhau. Song họ đã không quay trở lại. Tôi cất tiếng gọi: không thấy ai trả lời? Thấy lạ, tôi quyết định mò xuống phòng ăn.","Although I had only fainted for a short time, I was still very vague about the terrifying moments that had passed. When I regained consciousness, the first sound that reached my ears was the distant ringing of a death knell, followed by the barking of dogs around the house, and from the bushes in the garden, not far from my window, came the melodious singing of a nightingale. Sorrow, fear, and severe health deterioration all seemed to come at once, leaving me as lifeless as a dead person. However, hearing the nightingale's song, I felt as if I were hearing my mother's beloved voice, gently speaking in the dark to comfort me. Surely the strange noise had awakened the servants in the house, because I could clearly hear their bare footsteps softly stepping on the stair landing. Hearing my faint call, they quickly stepped into the room. They all screamed in fear; it goes without saying how terrified they were when they realized the misfortune that had befallen us and saw my mother lying on top of me. The wind blowing through the broken window occasionally made the door creak. The brave girls gathered around to move my mother aside so I could sit up. Knowing they were very emotional, I told them to go down to the dining room and have a sip of wine to calm down. They opened the door and then slammed it shut immediately after stepping out of the room. I could still hear them exclaim once more, followed by the sound of hurried footsteps rushing down the stairs. At that moment, I didn't know what to do except painfully pick up the flowers to place on my mother's chest and recall Professor Van Helsing's instructions, but remembering was just for the sake of remembering, as I no longer needed these flowers for anything. I anxiously waited for the servants to return: we would keep vigil together. But they did not return. I called out: no one answered. Finding it strange, I decided to grope my way down to the dining room."

There did not seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.","Al poco rato despertó, y yo le di alimentos tal como los había prescrito van Helsing. Sólo tomó unos pocos, y de mala gana. Parecía que ya no estaba con ella su antigua inconsciente lucha por la vida, y la fortaleza que hasta entonces había marcado su enfermedad. Me sorprendió como un hecho curioso el que en el momento de volverse consciente ella apretara las flores de ajo contra su pecho. Ciertamente era muy raro que cuando quiera que ella entrara a ese estado letárgico, con respiración estertórea, tratara de quitarse las flores, pero que al despertar las sujetara. No había ninguna posibilidad de cometer un error acerca de esto, pues en las largas horas que siguieron tuvo muchos períodos de sueño y vigilia, y repitió ambas acciones muchas veces.","Shortly after, she woke up, and I gave her food just as van Helsing had prescribed. She only took a little, and reluctantly. It seemed that her former unconscious struggle for life, and the strength that had marked her illness until then, were no longer with her. I was surprised by the curious fact that at the moment she became conscious, she pressed the garlic flowers against her chest.

Çok az yedi ve isteksizdi. Şimdiye dek hastalığının göstergesi olan yaşam ve güç savaşımı yok gibiydi. Bilinci yerine gelir gelmez sarmısak çiçeklerini göğsüne bastırması tuhafıma gitmişti. Ne zaman hırıltılı nefes alış verişle o uyku haline girse çiçekleri kendinden uzaklaştırması, ama uyandığında onlara sıkı sıkı sarılması kuşkusuz tuhaftı. Bu konuda hata yapmanın olasılığı yoktu, çünkü takip eden uzun saatler içinde çok sayıda uyku ve uyanma dönemi geçirdi ve bu iki eylemi de çok kere yineledi.","She woke up a little later and I gave her the meal prescribed by Van Helsing. She ate very little and was reluctant. There seemed to be no sign of the struggle for life and strength that had been indicative of her illness until now. It struck me as odd that as soon as she regained consciousness, she pressed the garlic flowers to her chest. It was certainly strange that whenever she fell into that state of sleep with labored breathing, she pushed the flowers away, but when she woke up, she clung to them tightly. There was no possibility of making a mistake in this matter, because she went through many periods of sleep and wakefulness over the long hours that followed, and she repeated these two actions many times.","2024-09-25T19:18:52.182270Z","Nằm thêm được một lúc nữa thì cô tỉnh dậy. Tôi cố gắng cho cô ăn một chút đúng như lời dặn của Van Helsing, cô ăn mà cứ như phải chịu một cực hình! Phải nói rằng mặc dù ngay cả cái sức lực vô thức của bản năng bây giờ cũng đã từ bỏ cô, nhưng dường như vẫn có một cái gì đó đang thôi thúc cô chiến đấu đến cùng chống lại bệnh tật và sẽ chiến thắng bệnh tật bằng mọi giá. Tôi thật sự ngạc nhiên khi thấy vừa mới tỉnh dậy, cô đã vội ôm xiết lấy tràng hoa tỏi. Tôi rất lấy làm lạ về điều này: cứ mỗi lần cô rơi vào trạng thái ngủ vùi khiến cho nhịp thở của cô trở nên rất khó nhọc là một lần cô lại đẩy tràng hoa ra xa. Ngược lại, cứ mỗi lần cô tỉnh hoặc sắp tỉnh dậy, tôi lại thấy cô ôm chặt lấy tràng hoa vào người. Còn một chuyện nữa mà tôi không thể nhầm: trong những giờ đồng hồ sau đó, tôi thấy cô tỉnh dậy rồi lại ngủ lịm đi rất nhiều lần, và sự việc cứ tiếp diễn như vậy với những động tác giống nhau của cô.","After lying for a while longer, she woke up. I tried to feed her a little as per Van Helsing's instructions, but she ate as if enduring a torture! Despite the fact that even her unconscious instinctive strength had now abandoned her, it seemed there was still something urging her to fight to the end against the illness and to conquer it at all costs. I was truly surprised to see that as soon as she woke up, she hurriedly clutched the garlic wreath. I found this very strange: every time she fell into a deep sleep, making her breathing very labored, she would push the wreath away. Conversely, every time she woke up or was about to wake up, I saw her clutch the wreath tightly to herself. There was one more thing I couldn't mistake: in the hours that followed, I saw her wake up and then fall back into a deep sleep many times, and this kept happening with the same actions from her."

Bu bir kadının kaldıramayacağı kadar büyük bir gerilim. İlk başta böyle düşünmüyordum, ama şimdi daha iyi anlıyorum. Bu nedenle, bu şekilde karar verildiği için memnunum. Duymaktan korkacağı şeyler olabilir; yine de eğer bir sır olduğundan kuşkulanırsa bunları ondan saklamak, söylemekten daha kötü olabilir. Bundan böyle görevimiz, en azından, ona her şeyin sona erdiğini ve dünyanın, cehennemden gelen bir canavardan kurtulduğunu söyleyebileceğimiz zaman gelene dek onun için mühürlü bir kitap olmalı.

I hope tonight's meeting hasn't upset her. I'm grateful that she is kept out of our future work and even our own discussions. This is too much tension for a woman to bear. I didn't think so at first, but now I understand better. Therefore, I am glad that it was decided this way. There might be things she would be afraid to hear; yet, if she suspects there is a secret, hiding it from her could be worse than telling it. From now on, our duty, at the very least, should be to remain a sealed book to her until the time comes when we can tell her that everything is over and the world is rid of a monster from hell. I think it will be hard to start keeping silent after the trust between us, but I will act decisively and tomorrow, I will not reveal any secrets about what happened tonight and will refuse to talk about it.

Rất có thể cô sẽ lo sợ khi nghe chúng tôi bàn về một vài điều gì đó. Tuy nhiên, biết đâu việc chúng tôi giấu cô có khi còn làm cô khủng hoảng hơn nếu một lúc nào đó, cô bỗng nghi ngờ chúng tôi muốn cô lặng thinh về chuyện này hay chuyện khác. Có thể trong thời gian tới, chúng tôi sẽ cố gắng để cô tuyệt đối không nghi ngờ gì về các quyết định và công việc của mình - ít nhất là cho đến lúc chúng tôi có thể thông báo cho cô biết rằng cơn quỷ khát máu kia đã vĩnh viễn bị loại bỏ khỏi trái đất này. Đối với tôi, giữ im lặng hoàn toàn không phải là một việc dễ dàng, nhất là khi hai chúng tôi có thói quen cái gì cũng tâm sự cho nhau nghe. Nhưng tôi đã quyết rồi, khi cô ấy thức dậy, nhất định tôi sẽ không kể gì về chuyện vừa xảy ra trong đêm. Nếu cô ấy có gặng hỏi, tôi cũng chỉ ậm ừ cho qua chuyện. Trời sắp sáng hẳn, tôi rón rén tới nằm nghỉ trên ghế trường kỷ để khỏi làm phiền giấc ngủ của cô.","I tiptoed back to the room. Mina was still deep in sleep, her breathing so slow and light that I had to lean in close to hear it. Only at this moment did I suddenly notice that she looked paler than usual. I hope yesterday's meeting didn't make her worry too much! Thankfully, she no longer participates in our investigations, searches, or decisions. She might get scared if she heard us discussing certain things. However, who knows if our keeping things from her might cause her even more distress if, at some point, she starts to suspect that we want her to stay silent about one thing or another. It is possible that in the near future, we will strive to ensure that you have absolutely no doubts about our decisions and work - at least until we can inform you that the bloodthirsty demon has been permanently eradicated from this earth. For me, keeping silent is not an easy task, especially when the two of us have the habit of sharing everything with each other. But I have decided, when she wakes up, I will definitely not tell her anything about what happened during the night. If she insists on asking, I will just mumble to brush it off. The sky was about to fully brighten, I tiptoed to lie down on the couch to avoid disturbing her sleep."

What I had just learned left me bewildered: the count could lift the wooden crates filled with earth by himself! Every minute passing now was very precious to me. Because it was very likely that he had already scattered the crates, one in each place, at the time he had chosen beforehand so that no one would notice. Upon reaching Piccadilly Circus, I got off the carriage and headed straight towards the west of the neighborhood. Just past the Juvenile Court, I immediately recognized the house I was looking for. I had no doubt that it was one of Count Dracula's lairs in England. The house seemed to have been abandoned for a very long time. The arched windows were all open, but every window was covered in a layer of dust. The dust of time had turned the wooden panels black and the iron decorations into objects that looked like they were made of earth. Looking at the balcony wall, I guessed there must have been a sign with the address and house name that had just been torn off, as the traces were still very fresh. I would have more information if that sign were still intact: it would tell me the name of the house's owner. I still remember how I gathered information to secure the brokerage contract for the Carfax house for Dracula before, and now I also believe that if I knew the previous owner of the house, I would be able to get inside."

No, no, my friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this your London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done, no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and got in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice; and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away within a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all they can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland he find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done en règle; and in our work we shall be en règle too. We shall not go so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem it strange; but we shall go after ten o’clock, when there are many about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the house.”","–Entonces -me miró fijamente, al tiempo que continuaba -, todo lo que estará en duda es la conciencia y la opinión de la policía en cuanto a si es el propietario quien recurrió al cerrajero y la opinión de la policía en cuanto a si el artesano está trabajando o no de acuerdo con las leyes. Su policía debe estar compuesta de hombres cuidadosos e inteligentes, extraordinariamente inteligentes para leer el corazón humano, si es que han de estar seguros de lo que deben hacer. No, no, amigo Jonathan, puede usted ir a abrir las cerraduras de un centenar de casas vacías en su Londres o en cualquier ciudad del mundo, y si lo hace de tal modo que parezca correcto, nadie intervendrá en absoluto. He leído algo sobre un caballero que tenía una hermosa casa en Londres y cuando fue a pasar los meses del verano en Suiza, dejando su casa cerrada, un delincuente rompió una de las ventanas de la parte posterior y entró. Luego se dirigió al frente, abrió las ventanas, levantó las persianas y salió por la puerta principal, ante los mismos ojos de la policía. A continuación, hizo una pública subasta en la casa, la anunció en todos los periódicos y, cuando llegó el día establecido, vendió todas las posesiones del caballero que se encontraba fuera. Luego, fue a ver a un constructor y le vendió la casa, estableciendo el acuerdo de que debería derribarla y retirar todos los escombros antes de una fecha determinada. Tanto la policía como el resto de las autoridades inglesas lo ayudaron todo lo que pudieron. Cuando el verdadero propietario regresó de Suiza encontró solamente un solar vacío en el lugar en que había estado su casa.

Nhưng anh bạn Jonathan thân mến ạ, đôi khi anh vẫn có thể dùng móc mở khóa hàng trăm ngôi nhà ở Luân Đôn hoặc ở bất kỳ đâu trên thế giới này mà không sao, miễn là anh tạo ra một hoàn cảnh thích hợp và làm đúng lúc. Tôi có thể kể cho mọi người nghe một câu chuyện mà tôi đã từng đọc. Chuyện là thế này: Có một quý ngài sở hữu một biệt thự tuyệt đẹp ở Luân Đôn. Mùa hè năm đó, do có việc phải đi Thụy Sĩ trong một thời gian khá lâu, khoảng dăm bảy tháng gì đó, ông đã chủ quan khóa cửa nhà trước khi lên đường và chẳng cần nhờ ai trông nom hết. Kết quả là sau khi ông đi được một thời gian ngắn, có kẻ trộm đã đập vỡ kính một ô cửa sổ nhìn ra vườn rồi đột nhập vào trong. Vào nhà rồi, hắn bèn mở tất cả các ô cửa sổ ở mặt tiền của ngôi nhà và đàng hoàng mở cửa chính đi ra ngoài ngay trước mắt đám cảnh sát. Sau đó, hắn công khai rao bán sạch mọi đồ đạc trong nhà bằng một tấm biển quảng cáo to tướng dán trên tường ngoài cổng, hắn đã nhờ một đại diện bán đấu giá tới bán tất cả đồ đạc của quý ngài đang ở Thụy Sĩ kia. Thế rồi chính ngôi nhà cũng bị hắn bán tống cho một chủ thầu xây dựng vì hắn đã tìm được giấy tờ sở hữu cất trong nhà. Tay chủ thầu đã bàn với hắn phá bỏ ngôi nhà vào một ngày cụ thể để cất lên một tòa nhà mới. Cảnh sát và chính quyền thành phố cứ tưởng hắn là chủ nhân thật sự của ngôi biệt thự nên đã tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho hợp đồng xây dựng trao tay này. Chỉ buồn cho người chủ thật sự của ngôi nhà, từ Thụy Sĩ về, trước mắt ông chỉ còn là một cái hố vĩ đại thế chỗ cho ngôi nhà thân quen của ông. Nhưng biết làm sao được, mọi việc đều diễn ra hợp lệ, đúng nguyên tắc mua bán và xây dựng mà thành phố đã quy định. Có lẽ công việc của chúng ta cũng nên tuân theo các nguyên tắc tương tự. Không nên đến Piccadilly quá sớm để tránh sự soi mói của cảnh sát, chỉ có như vậy họ mới không tình cờ để ý thấy sự xuất hiện của chúng ta là không bình thường. Sớm lắm thì cũng chỉ được phép bắt đầu từ mười giờ trở đi, vì khi đó, thể nào người qua lại cũng nghĩ chúng ta chính là chủ nhân thực sự của ngôi nhà.","Additionally, the success of the operation also depends on the gullibility of the local police officers. But my dear friend Jonathan, sometimes you can still use a hook to unlock hundreds of houses in London or anywhere else in the world without any trouble, as long as you create the right circumstances and do it at the right time. I can tell everyone a story that I once read. The story goes like this: There was a gentleman who owned a beautiful mansion in London. That summer, due to having to go to Switzerland for quite a long time, about five to seven months, he carelessly locked the house before leaving and didn't ask anyone to look after it. As a result, shortly after he left, a thief broke the glass of a window facing the garden and broke in. Once inside, he opened all the windows at the front of the house and boldly walked out the front door right in front of the police. After that, he openly advertised the sale of all the furniture in the house with a huge advertisement board posted on the wall outside the gate. He hired an auction representative to sell all the belongings of the gentleman who was in Switzerland. Then, he even sold the house itself to a building contractor because he found the ownership papers stored in the house. The contractor discussed with him to demolish the house on a specific day to build a new building. The police and city authorities thought he was the real owner of the mansion, so they facilitated this construction contract handover. Unfortunately for the real owner of the house, when he returned from Switzerland, all he saw was a giant hole in place of his familiar house. But what could be done, everything happened legally, following the city's buying and building regulations. Perhaps our work should also follow similar principles. We shouldn't arrive at Piccadilly too early to avoid the scrutiny of the police; only then will they not accidentally notice that our presence is unusual. At the earliest, we should only start from ten o'clock onwards, because by then, passersby will think we are the real owners of the house."

Trước khi chúc nhau ngủ ngon, chúng tôi đã có sự trao đổi về bước đi tiếp theo nhưng không khai thông được điều gì. Tất cả những gì chúng tôi biết là: vẫn còn một thùng gỗ mà lão bá tước có thể ẩn náu được và chỉ mình lão biết chỗ cất giấu thùng gỗ đó. Nếu lựa chọn giải pháp ở ẩn thì lão sẽ buộc chúng tôi phải thất bại trong nhiều năm, nhưng điều chúng tôi cần lúc này... Viễn cảnh bày ra trước mắt chúng tôi thật là khủng khiếp, khiến tôi không dám đoán già đoán non một điều gì. Tôi không chắc một điều, ấy là nếu bao giờ có một người đàn bà hoàn hảo, nhưng hồng nhan bạc phận, thì đó chính là người vợ yêu dấu của tôi. Càng nghĩ, tôi càng thấy yêu thương cô đến quặn lòng và càng cảm thấy căm thù con quỷ kia đến ngàn lần. Chắc chắn Chúa sẽ không để thế giới này nghèo nàn đi bởi sự mất mát một tạo hóa như cô. Vậy là trong tôi lại trào dâng một niềm hy vọng tất thắng. Bây giờ chúng tôi đang mất phương hướng và chỉ còn một mỏ neo duy nhất, ấy là niềm tin. Ơn Chúa, Mina đã ngủ mà không bị một cơn mê nào gây phiền toái. Tôi rất sợ những gì có trong giấc mơ xuất phát từ những hồi ức đáng sợ của cô. Từ lúc chiều tà tới giờ, tôi chưa thấy cô có biểu hiện đau đớn, vật vã nào. Trong khoảnh khắc, tôi nhận ra sự thanh bình trên nét mặt cô, giống như tiết trời xuân sau những cơn mưa bất chợt tháng ba... Tôi không thấy buồn ngủ, dù rằng trong người cảm thấy đã tàn hơi muốn chết. Tuy nhiên, tôi cố phải ngủ bằng được, cần phải nghĩ tới ngày mai. Tôi sẽ không yên chừng nào...","• October 3 - 4, after midnight It seemed like yesterday would never end. There was something urging me to fall asleep, a vague belief telling me that when I woke up, I would witness a change and from now on, everything would change favorably for us. Before wishing each other good night, we had a discussion about the next step but did not come to any conclusion. All we knew was: there was still a wooden crate where the old count could hide, and only he knew where it was hidden. If he chose to remain in hiding, he would force us to fail for many years, but what we needed right now... The prospect before us was truly terrifying, making me afraid to make any guesses. I am not sure about one thing, that is if there ever was a perfect woman, but with a tragic fate, it would be my beloved wife. The more I thought, the more I loved her to the point of heartache and the more I hated that demon a thousand times over. Surely God would not let this world be impoverished by the loss of a creation like her. So within me surged a hope of certain victory. Now we are lost and have only one anchor left, which is faith. Thank God, Mina slept without any troubling dreams. I am very afraid of what might be in her dreams stemming from her terrifying memories. Since dusk until now, I have not seen her show any signs of pain or distress. In a moment, I recognized the peace on her face, like the spring weather after the sudden rains of March... I did not feel sleepy, even though I felt utterly exhausted. However, I forced myself to sleep, needing to think about tomorrow. I will not be at ease until..."
