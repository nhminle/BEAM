The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.","Terminado el almuerzo, el señor Lorry salió a dar un paseíto por la playa. No se divisaba desde ella la pequeña e irregular ciudad de Dover, excepción hecha de sus tejados que, metidos entre picachos de canteras calizas, semejaban gigantesca ostra marina. Era la playa un desierto erizado de peñascales y plagado de escollos, donde la mar hacía lo que se la antojaba, y lo que se la antojaba invariablemente era destruir. Casi de continuo rugía contra la ciudad, bramaba contra los farallones, embestía contra los peñascos que pretendían oponerse a su paso y los derribaba con estruendo. Respirábase en las casas un olor tan fuerte a pescado, que no parecía sino que los habitantes de las aguas salían de éstas para curar en las casas sus enfermedades, de la misma manera que las personas enfermas suelen buscar la salud en los baños de mar. Algunos, muy pocos, se dedicaban a la pesca en aquellas aguas, y si durante el día la playa estaba siempre desierta, en cambio por la noche se veían personas que clavaban sus miradas inquietas en la inmensidad del mar. Comerciantes insignificantes a los que nunca se veía hacer un negocio, realizaban de pronto fortunas inmensas que no tenían explicación racional, y era muy de notar que nadie, por aquellos lugares, podía sufrir la presencia de una luz, de la que huían como del demonio.","After lunch, Mr. Lorry went out for a little walk along the beach. The small and irregular town of Dover was not visible from there, except for its rooftops which, nestled among the peaks of limestone quarries, resembled a gigantic marine oyster. The beach was a desert bristling with rocks and plagued with reefs, where the sea did whatever it pleased, and what it invariably pleased to do was destroy. Almost continuously, it roared against the town, bellowed against the cliffs, charged against the rocks that tried to block its path and knocked them down with a crash. In the houses, there was such a strong smell of fish that it seemed as if the inhabitants of the waters came out to cure their illnesses in the houses, just as sick people often seek health in sea baths. A few, very few, engaged in fishing in those waters, and if during the day the beach was always deserted, at night, on the other hand, people could be seen staring anxiously into the vastness of the sea. Insignificant merchants who were never seen doing business suddenly amassed immense fortunes that had no rational explanation, and it was very noticeable that no one in those places could tolerate the presence of a light, from which they fled as if from the devil.",976,82.905,130,"","Aligned 😊","mr Lorry kahvaltısını bitirdiğinde deniz kıyısında gezintiye çıktı. Kargacık burgacık sokaklarıyla küçük Dover kasabası kıyıdan saklanmış, başını devekuşu gibi beyaz yamaca gömmüştü. Sahil, denizin kabaran dalgalarıyla taşların yuvarlanıp durduğu bir çölü andırıyordu ve deniz istediği şeyi yapıyordu, istediği de ortalığı yıkıp geçmekti. Sesi kasabada, yamaçta, her yerde gürlüyor, kıyıyı alt üst ediyordu. Evlerin etrafını öyle ağır bir balık kokusu sarmıştı ki, insan tüm hasta balıkların denizin tepesine bu havaya karışmak için yükseldiğini sanırdı, denize karışmak için denizin dibine çöken hasta insanların tersine. Limanda az da olsa balıkçılık yapılıyordu ve akşamları, özellikle de sular yükselip etrafı su bastığında yürüyüş yapanlar ve denizi izleyenlerle epeyce hareketlenirdi ortalık. Fazla iş yapmayan küçük esnaf bazen –nasıl oluyorsa– büyük servetler elde ederdi ve o anlarda herkes fenercilerden uzak dururdu.","When Mr. Lorry finished his breakfast, he went for a walk by the seaside. The small town of Dover, with its winding streets, was hidden from the shore, burying its head in the white hillside like an ostrich. The shore resembled a desert where the stones rolled with the swelling waves of the sea, and the sea did whatever it wanted, which was to wreak havoc. Its roar echoed in the town, on the hillside, everywhere, turning the shore upside down. A heavy fish smell enveloped the houses so much that one would think all the sick fish had risen to the surface of the sea to mix with this air, unlike the sick people who sank to the bottom of the sea to merge with it. There was a bit of fishing in the harbor, and in the evenings, especially when the waters rose and flooded the surroundings, the place would become quite lively with walkers and sea watchers. The small tradesmen, who didn't do much business, sometimes – somehow – made great fortunes, and at those times everyone stayed away from the lighthouse keepers.","2024-09-23T19:20:37.177351Z","Sau khi dùng xong bữa điểm tâm, ông Lorry ra ngoài đi dạo trên bãi biển. Thành phố Dover quanh co, chật hẹp, nhỏ bé náu mình cách xa bờ, một đầu đâm thẳng ra dãy vách núi đá vôi như con đà điểu cắm đầu xuống biển. Bãi hoang vắng chỉ có những đợt sóng quăng quật đá lăn tứ tung; biển chỉ làm điều nó thích và ý thích đó là hủy diệt. Biển giáng sấm sét xuống thành phố, giáng sấm sét lên các vách núi, và điên cuồng nện sóng vào bờ. Bầu không khí giữa các ngôi nhà tanh nồng tới mức ta tưởng đâu những con cá bệnh tật đều mò tới dầm mình trong phố giống như những người đau ốm đi ngâm mình trong nước biển. Ít ai đánh cá ở cảng này, nhưng ban đêm có rất nhiều kẻ lảng vảng quanh đây và nhìn ra biển - đặc biệt vào những lúc thủy triều lớn và gần ngập lụt. Nhiều người buôn vặt chẳng hề làm ăn gì có khi lại kiếm được những tài sản lớn một cách khó hiểu, và điều đáng chú ý là không ai trong khu vực này mà không thấy khó chịu với người thắp đèn đêm*.","After finishing his breakfast, Mr. Lorry went out for a walk on the beach. The city of Dover, winding, narrow, and small, nestled away from the shore, with one end jutting straight into the chalk cliffs like an ostrich burying its head in the sea. The deserted beach had only waves tossing stones around; the sea did whatever it pleased, and its pleasure was destruction. The sea thundered down on the city, thundered down on the cliffs, and madly pounded the shore. The air between the houses was so fishy that one might think all the sick fish had come to immerse themselves in the town like sick people soaking in seawater. Few fished in this port, but at night many loitered around and looked out to sea - especially during high tides and near floods. Many petty traders who did no business at all sometimes inexplicably amassed great fortunes, and it was notable that no one in this area was comfortable with the night lamp-lighter*."

There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but coughed just one grain of cough.

Una de las características de la señora Defarge consistía en no sufrir nunca equivocaciones que redundasen en perjuicio de sus intereses en ninguna de las operaciones del establecimiento. Extremadamente sensible al frío, iba envuelta en pieles y abrigaba su cabeza con un chal de colores chillones que la cubría por completo, bien que dejando a la vista los grandes pendientes que adornaban sus orejas. Tenía frente a sí su calceta, pero la había dejado sobre el mostrador para consagrar algunos minutos a la limpieza de su dentadura, lo que estaba haciendo con un mondadientes.

She was a woman of robust constitution, approximately the same age as her husband, with watchful eyes, although very rarely did she seem to look at any particular object, large hands covered with rings, a face with energetic lines, a reserved expression, and an air of perfect composure. One of Mrs. Defarge's characteristics was never making mistakes that would harm her interests in any of the establishment's operations. Extremely sensitive to the cold, she was wrapped in furs and covered her head with a brightly colored shawl that completely covered her, though it left visible the large earrings that adorned her ears. She had her knitting in front of her, but she had left it on the counter to devote a few minutes to cleaning her teeth, which she was doing with a toothpick. Absorbed in her occupation, with her right elbow resting on her left hand, Mrs. Defarge said nothing when her husband entered the establishment, but she let out a barely perceptible little cough.

She had an air about her that gave the impression she never made a mistake in any calculation she undertook. Since Madam Defarge was sensitive to the cold, she was wrapped in furs and had tied a brightly colored scarf around her head, but her large earrings were still visible. She had set aside her knitting to pick her teeth with a toothpick. Since she was busy supporting her right elbow with her left hand, she didn't say anything when her husband arrived, merely contenting herself with a slight cough. Accompanied by this cough, the way she raised her dark eyebrows, which were like thin lines, was a gesture indicating that there had been customers while her husband was outside and that it would be good for him to attend to them.","2024-09-23T19:23:53.689818Z","Chị Defarge, vợ anh ta, đang ngồi sau quầy trong quán lúc anh đi vào.

Mrs. Defarge exuded something that made one think that this mistress rarely made mistakes in matters of money calculation. Unable to bear the cold, Mrs. Defarge wrapped herself tightly in a fur coat, with a large, brightly colored scarf twisted around her head but still revealing large hoop earrings. The knitting lay in front of her, but she had stopped knitting to pick her teeth with a toothpick. Her left hand supporting her right elbow as she picked her teeth, Mrs. Defarge said nothing when her husband walked in, only clearing her throat softly. Accompanying the throat clearing, her thick dark eyebrows above the toothpick raised slightly, signaling to her husband to look around at the customers in the shop to see who had come in while he was across the street."

Every little habitation within the great foul nest of one high building—that is to say, the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircase—left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides flinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison, the way lay. Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to his young companion’s agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr. Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in. Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.","Penoso, muy penoso, sería hoy subir la escalera de una casa de las más viejas sita en uno de los barrios más poblados de París; pero en el tiempo a que esta historia se refiere, resultaba punto menos que imposible para los que no tuvieran atrofiados los sentidos a fuerza de costumbre. Todos los vecinos de aquellas inmensas colmenas dejaban las basuras e inmundicias en los rellanos de la escalera general, donde quedaban hacinados sin que nadie cuidara de retirarlos, engendrando así una masa de descomposición bastante para envenenar el aire, si ya no estuviera saturado de las impurezas intangibles que son resultado natural de la miseria y de las privaciones. Combinadas las dos fuentes de corrupción, respirábase allí una atmósfera insoportable. El señor Lorry, cediendo a las molestias que le producía subir por aquel pozo obscuro, sucio y envenenado, no menos que a la agitación que observaba en su joven compañera, agitación que se multiplicaba por momentos, hizo alto dos veces para descansar. Cada uno de aquellos descansos pareció llevarse las últimas reservas de aire no corrompido, rellenando el espacio que aquéllas dejaban libre con mefíticas emanaciones que brotaban de todas partes.","Painful, very painful, it would be today to climb the stairs of one of the oldest houses located in one of the most populated neighborhoods of Paris; but at the time to which this story refers, it was almost impossible for those who did not have their senses atrophied by force of habit. All the neighbors of those immense hives left the garbage and filth on the landings of the main staircase, where they piled up without anyone caring to remove them, thus generating a mass of decomposition sufficient to poison the air, if it were not already saturated with the intangible impurities that are the natural result of misery and deprivation. Combined, the two sources of corruption created an unbearable atmosphere. Mr. Lorry, yielding to the discomfort caused by climbing that dark, dirty, and poisoned well, as well as to the agitation he observed in his young companion, which multiplied by the moment, stopped twice to rest. Each of those rests seemed to take away the last reserves of uncorrupted air, filling the space they left free with mephitic emanations that sprang from all sides.",984,31.07,256,"es needs one more sentence","Modify 🛠️","Paris'in nispeten daha eski ve daha kalabalık olan bölgelerinde olsa, böyle bir merdivenin, bütün o teferruatlarıyla kötü görünmesi doğal karşılanırdı ama o gün, sefalet nedir bilmeyen bu kibar şahıslar için tam anlamıyla iğrenç bir yerdi burası. Bu yüksek pislik yuvası binadaki her küçük meskende –başka deyişle, merdivene açılan her bir oda ya da odalarda– yaşayanlar, bütün süprüntülerini kendi merdiven sahanlığına yığmış, geri kalanı da pencerelerden aşağı fırlatmıştı. Bu kontrolden çıkmış umutsuz çöp yığını öyle bir kaplamıştı ki her yanı, yoksulluk ve mahrumiyet gözle görülmez pislikleriyle buna eklenmemiş dahi olsalardı, havayı kirletmeye yeterlerdi; bu ikisinin bir araya gelişi ise gerçekten dayanılmazdı. Ama yola devam etmek için bu havayı solumaları, bu dik, karanlık pislik ve zehir kuyusuna dalmaları gerekiyordu. mr Jarvis Lorry, giderek artan endişelerine ve genç yoldaşının heyecanına dayanamayarak iki kere durup dinlendi. Bu molaların her biri, temiz kalmış bir parça güzel ve mahzun havanın içinden uçup gittiği, yerine pis bir buharın süzüldüğü kederli pencere kafeslerinin önünde veriliyordu. Paslı çubuklardan o karman çorman mahallenin görüntüleri yerine havası göze çarpıyordu ve göründüğü kadarıyla, Notre-Dame'ın iki büyük kulesinin tepesinin yakınında ya da aşağısında kalan hiçbir yerde sağlıklı bir yaşama ya da umuda dair bir emare yoktu.","In the relatively older and more crowded areas of Paris, it would be natural for such a staircase to look bad with all its details, but that day, for these genteel individuals who knew nothing of misery, this place was utterly disgusting. The inhabitants of every small dwelling in this high filth nest of a building –in other words, every room or rooms opening onto the staircase– had piled all their rubbish onto their own landing and thrown the rest out of the windows. This out-of-control heap of hopeless trash had covered everything so much that even if the invisible filth of poverty and deprivation had not been added to it, it would have been enough to pollute the air; the combination of these two was truly unbearable. But to continue on their way, they had to breathe this air, dive into this steep, dark pit of filth and poison. Mr. Jarvis Lorry, unable to bear his increasing anxieties and the excitement of his young companion, stopped and rested twice. Each of these pauses was taken in front of sorrowful window grilles where a piece of clean, beautiful, and melancholy air had flown away, replaced by a foul vapor. Instead of the views of that chaotic neighborhood, the air was noticeable through the rusty bars, and as far as could be seen, there was no sign of healthy living or hope anywhere near or below the tops of Notre-Dame's two great towers.","2024-09-23T19:24:46.911939Z","Một cầu thang như vậy, cùng các thứ phụ thuộc, ở những khu đông đúc và xưa cũ hơn của Paris hẳn là tồi tệ so với thời nay; nhưng ngay cả thời đó nó cũng đã khó chịu đối với những ai chưa quen thuộc và tôi luyện. Mọi nơi cư trú trong lòng cái tổ hôi thối là căn nhà cao này nói cách khác, từng căn phòng, căn hộ đằng sau cánh cửa nào mở ra cầu thang chung này - đều để một đống rác rưởi của mình trên đầu cầu thang các tầng, cùng với việc quẳng các thứ phế thải khác qua cửa sổ. Cho dù không vấn vương cái mùi nghèo túng đi nữa, cái đống phân hủy tuyệt vọng và cứ sinh sôi vô phương kiểm soát ấy ắt đã đủ đầu độc cả bầu không khí rồi; nhưng khi cả rác rưởi lẫn nghèo túng cùng hợp sức thì mùi xú uế không sao chịu nổi. Muốn đi phải xuyên qua bầu không khí ấy, phải băng qua lồng cầu thang tăm tối, dốc đứng, bẩn thỉu và độc địa ấy. Ông Jarvis Lorry đã hai lần phải tạm dừng lấy sức vì quá mệt với những ý nghĩ bất an của mình lẫn nỗi bồn chồn của cô nương đi cùng. Lần nào ông cũng dừng lại ở ô cửa thông gió thảm hại nhưng dường như chút không khí trong lành đáng mong muốn nào còn sót lại đều đã thoát ra hết và bao luồng hơi tanh tưởi hôi hám bên ngoài lại len lỏi vào trong. Qua những song sắt gỉ sét của ô thông gió, ta hầu như nếm được chứ không thấy được khu vực hỗn độn này; và trong phạm vi từ đây cho tới hai đỉnh tháp cao của Thánh đường Notre-Dame, mọi thứ gần hơn hay thấp hơn đều không có chút gì hứa hẹn về cuộc sống an lành hay những ước vọng cao xa.","Such a staircase, along with its dependencies, in the more crowded and older areas of Paris, must have been worse compared to today; but even at that time, it was unpleasant for those who were not familiar and hardened. Every residence within the stinking nest that was this tall house, in other words, every room, apartment behind any door that opened onto this common staircase - left a pile of their garbage at the top of the stairs of each floor, along with throwing other waste out the window. Even if it didn't carry the lingering smell of poverty, that heap of desperate decay and uncontrollable proliferation would have been enough to poison the entire atmosphere; but when both garbage and poverty join forces, the stench becomes unbearable. To move forward, one had to pass through that atmosphere, crossing the dark, steep, filthy, and noxious stairwell. Mr. Jarvis Lorry had to pause twice to catch his breath, exhausted by his own anxious thoughts and the restlessness of the young lady accompanying him. Each time he stopped at the miserable ventilation window, it seemed that any desirable fresh air had already escaped, and the foul, stinking vapors from outside had seeped in. Through the rusty bars of the ventilation window, one could almost taste rather than see this chaotic area; and within the range from here to the two tall towers of Notre-Dame Cathedral, nothing closer or lower promised a life of tranquility or lofty aspirations."

Fortunately, my error is one that does not cause harm to the one who was its victim. There are many young ladies who have committed similar follies, which they have come to regret when it was already too late, when they found themselves plunged into ruin and misery... Poor things!... I do not blame them! Indeed, they are worthy of compassion! Youth is so thoughtless!... Seeing what happened from a point of view free of all selfishness, I regret it, because it would have been a good deal for her, and if I look at it through the prism of my selfishness, I cannot help but celebrate a failure that saves me from making a disastrous deal. You will understand, without me having to say it, that I, far from gaining, was losing, and not a little. Of course, so far it has done me no harm. I have not offered my hand to that young lady, and here between us, speaking frankly, I never thought of making such an offer.

Young ladies often make similar foolish mistakes and often regret them when they find themselves in poverty and darkness. For the person in question, I regret that this did not come to pass, because if it had, it would have been a misfortune for me, from a material gain perspective; but for myself, I am glad it did not come to pass, because if it had, it would also have been a misfortune for me, from a material gain perspective... needless to say, I would have gained nothing. No harm has occurred. I have not proposed to that young lady, and just between you and me, looking back, I am not even sure if I need to get married that much.
