The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.","Lord Henry Wotton, que había consumido ya, según su costumbre, innumerables cigarrillos, vislumbraba, desde el extremo del sofá donde estaba tumbado —tapizado al estilo de las alfombras persas—, el resplandor de las floraciones de un codeso, de dulzura y color de miel, cuyas ramas estremecidas apenas parecían capaces de soportar el peso de una belleza tan deslumbrante como la suya; y, de cuando en cuando, las sombras fantásticas de pájaros en vuelo se deslizaban sobre las largas cortinas de seda india colgadas delante de las inmensas ventanas, produciendo algo así como un efecto japonés, lo que le hacía pensar en los pintores de Tokyo, de rostros tan pálidos como el jade, que, por medio de un arte necesariamente inmóvil, tratan de transmitir la sensación de velocidad y de movimiento. El zumbido obstinado de las abejas, abriéndose camino entre el alto césped sin segar, o dando vueltas con monótona insistencia en torno a los polvorientos cuernos dorados de las desordenadas madreselvas, parecían hacer más opresiva la quietud, mientras los ruidos confusos de Londres eran como las notas graves de un órgano lejano.","Lord Henry Wotton, who had already consumed, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, glimpsed, from the end of the sofa where he was lying —upholstered in the style of Persian carpets—, the glow of the blossoms of a broom, sweet and honey-colored, whose trembling branches barely seemed capable of bearing the weight of such dazzling beauty as theirs; and, from time to time, the fantastic shadows of birds in flight slid over the long Indian silk curtains hanging in front of the immense windows, producing something like a Japanese effect, which made him think of the painters of Tokyo, with faces as pale as jade, who, through a necessarily motionless art, try to convey the sensation of speed and movement. The obstinate buzzing of bees, making their way through the tall unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence around the dusty golden horns of the disordered honeysuckles, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive, while the confused noises of London were like the deep notes of a distant organ.",1865,14.853,2,"","Aligned 😊","İran heybeleriyle döşenmiş divanın köşesinde uzanmış, huyu olduğu üzere sayısız sigara tüttüren Lord Henry Wotton, bulunduğu yerden sarı salkım ağacının balrengi, bal tatlısı çiçeklerini seçebiliyordu. Ağacın titrek dalları, böylesi aleve benzer bir güzelliğin yükünü taşımakta güçlük çeker gibiydi. Kocaman pencerenin önünde gerili duran uzun, ipekli perdelerin üzerine arada düş gibi kuş gölgeleri vuruyordu. İlk bakışta bir Japon havası çağrıştıran bu perdeler Lord Henry’ye, Tokyo’nun solgun, zümrüt benizli ressamlarını anımsatıyordu; zorunluluk gereği durağan olan bir sanat aracılığıyla hareket ve hız aktarmaya çalışan ressamlar. Yüksek, biçilmemiş otlar arasında kendilerine yol açmaya çalışan ya da sere serpe frenkasmalarının tozlu, yaldızlı boynuzlarının çevresinde tekdüze bir ısrarla dönüp duran arıların donuk mırıltısı, ortalığın dinginliğini büsbütün sıkıcı kılar gibiydi.

The tree's trembling branches seemed to struggle under the burden of such flame-like beauty. Occasionally, the shadows of birds, like dreams, would fall upon the long, silken curtains stretched in front of the large window. At first glance, these curtains, which evoked a Japanese atmosphere, reminded Lord Henry of the pale, emerald-faced painters of Tokyo; painters who tried to convey movement and speed through the necessarily static medium of art. The dull hum of bees, either trying to make their way through the tall, uncut grass or circling monotonously around the dusty, gilded horns of the sprawling French marigolds, seemed to make the tranquility of the surroundings all the more tedious. The faint hum of London resembled the bass notes of a distant organ melody.","2024-09-21T19:20:44.755635Z","Từ góc chiếc đi-văng bọc thảm giả túi yên lạc đà Ba Tư mà trên đó y nằm hút, theo thói quen, vô số điếu thuốc, huân tước Henry Wotton chỉ có thể loáng thoáng thấy được những bông hoa ngọt-mật và màu-mật của một cây kim tước mà những cái cành run rẩy của nó dường như khó khăn lắm mới có thể mang nổi gánh nặng một vẻ đẹp rừng rực nhường ấy; và thỉnh thoảng, những chiếc bóng dị thường của lũ chim đang bay lượn lại vụt qua các tấm màn lụa tuýt-so dài căng trước ô cửa rộng, gây nên cảm giác gì đó từa tựa như một ấn tượng Nhật Bản nhất thời, và khiến y nghĩ về những họa sỹ mặt xanh nanh vàng ở Tokyo, những kẻ, nhờ vào sự trung gian của một nghệ thuật vốn dĩ tất yếu là bất động, đã cố gắng chuyển tải ý thức về sự mau lẹ và sự chuyển động. Tiếng rì rầm rầu rĩ của lũ ong đang len lỏi qua bãi cỏ dài chưa cắt, hoặc xoay tròn với sự cố chấp đơn điệu quanh các cái sừng thiếp vàng phủ bụi phấn của cây kim ngân bò lan um tùm, dường như khiến cho cảnh tĩnh mịch ấy lại còn ngột ngạt hơn. Tiếng gầm âm ỉ của thành London hệt như nốt buộc-đông của cây đàn ống xa xôi.","From the corner of the Persian camel saddlebag-patterned divan on which he habitually lay smoking countless cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could only faintly see the honey-sweet and honey-colored blossoms of a laburnum tree whose trembling branches seemed to struggle under the weight of such a blazing beauty; and occasionally, the strange shadows of birds in flight would flicker across the long tussore silk curtains drawn before the wide window, evoking a sensation somewhat akin to a fleeting Japanese impression, and making him think of the green-faced, yellow-fanged artists in Tokyo, who, through the medium of an inherently static art, had attempted to convey a sense of swiftness and movement. The mournful hum of bees threading through the long, uncut grass, or circling with monotonous persistence around the golden-tipped horns of the overgrown honeysuckle, seemed to make the stillness even more oppressive. The distant roar of London was like the pedal note of a far-off organ."

They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us an impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that.

Tôi nghĩ rằng lời giải thích chính xác là thế này. Một điều thường xảy ra là các bi kịch thật sự trong đời lại xuất hiện theo một lối phản nghệ thuật đến nỗi chúng làm tổn thương ta bằng sự hung hãn thô bạo, sự rời rạc tuyệt đối, sự vô nghĩa phi lý, sự thiếu vắng phong cách. Chúng ảnh hưởng đến ta hệt như sự thô tục ảnh hưởng đến ta. Chúng cho ta một ấn tượng về sức mạnh hung ác tuyệt đối, và ta cưỡng lại chúng. Tuy nhiên, đôi lúc, một bi kịch có các yếu tố nghệ thuật đẹp đẽ cắt ngang đời ta. Nếu những yếu tố đẹp đẽ này là thật, thì toàn bộ sự việc rất dễ hấp dẫn khả năng cảm nhận của ta về hiệu ứng kịch. Đột nhiên ta thấy rằng ta không còn là diễn viên nữa, mà là các khán giả của vở kịch. Hoặc đúng hơn thì ta là cả hai. Ta xem chính mình, và chính nỗi ngạc nhiên với sự trình diễn này đã mê hoặc ta. Trong cảnh ngộ hiện thời, chuyện gì đã thực sự xảy ra? Có người tự sát vì yêu cậu. Ước gì tôi có lúc được hưởng một trải nghiệm như vậy. Nó sẽ khiến tôi đem lòng yêu tình yêu suốt quãng đời còn lại của mình. Những người từng mê tôi — không nhiều lắm, nhưng cũng có một số — luôn nhất định sống tiếp, rất lâu sau khi tôi đã thôi quan tâm đến họ, hoặc họ quan tâm đến tôi. Họ đẫy ra, nhạt đi, và khi tôi gặp lại họ thì họ lập tức trôi vào kỷ niệm. Cái ký ức kinh dị ấy về đàn bà! Nó là một thứ đáng sợ biết bao! Và nó để lộ ra một tình trạng mụ mẫm trí tuệ triệt để làm sao! Ta nên hấp thu sắc màu cuộc sống, nhưng đừng bao giờ nhớ các chi tiết của nó. Các chi tiết luôn thô tục.”","“That is an interesting question,” Lord Henry said, finding a refined pleasure in playing with the unconscious selfishness of the young man — “a very interesting question. I think the correct explanation is this. It often happens that the real tragedies in life occur in such an anti-artistic manner that they hurt us with their brutal aggression, absolute disjointedness, absurd senselessness, and lack of style. They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us an impression of absolute malicious power, and we resist them. However, sometimes, a tragedy with beautiful artistic elements intersects our lives. If these beautiful elements are real, then the whole affair easily captivates our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are no longer actors, but the audience of the play. Or rather, we are both. We watch ourselves, and it is the very surprise of this performance that fascinates us. In the current situation, what has actually happened? Someone has committed suicide because they loved you. I wish I could have such an experience sometime. It would make me love love for the rest of my life. The people who have been infatuated with me — not many, but there have been some — always insisted on living on, long after I had ceased to care for them, or they for me. They fade away, become dull, and when I meet them again, they immediately drift into memory. That dreadful memory of women! How terrifying it is!

Bir gün bu konu konuşulurken Lord Henry’nin dediği üzere, baş yemeğin sofraya soğuk gelişinin günahını en üstün erdemler bile ödeyemez! Onun bu görüşünün çok yerinde olduğunu sanıyoruz. Çünkü yüksek sosyetenin temel yasalarıyla sanatın temel yasaları birdir ya da bir olmalıdır. Biçim, sosyete için kesinlikle vazgeçilmeyecek bir öğedir. Bu biçim, bir törenin saygınlığına ve asılsızlığına sahip olmalıdır ve romantik bir sahne oyununun yapmacık niteliğiyle böyle oyunları bize sevdiren kıvrak nükte ve güzelliği özünde birleştirmelidir.

Và, rốt cuộc thì ta cũng chẳng được an ủi là bao khi nghe bảo rằng cái người đã cho ta một bữa tối tồi tàn, hoặc món rượu tệ hại, lại không thể chê trách được trong đời tư. Thậm chí lòng tốt nồng ấm cũng không thể cứu chuộc được món khai vị nguội lạnh, như huân tước Henry có lần nhận xét, trong một cuộc thảo luận về chủ đề này; và có lẽ có rất nhiều điều để nói về cách nhìn của anh ấy. Bởi lẽ các tiêu chuẩn của một xã hội tốt cũng giống, hoặc nên giống, như các tiêu chuẩn nghệ thuật. Hình thái là yếu tố tuyệt đối cần thiết với nó.
