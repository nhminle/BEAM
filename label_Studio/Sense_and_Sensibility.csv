The son, a steady respectable young man, was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large, and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his wealth. To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that property, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her child, and he had only a life–interest in it.","De un matrimonio anterior, el señor Henry Dashwood tenía un hijo; y de su esposa actual, tres hijas. El hijo, un joven serio y respetable, tenía el futuro asegurado por la fortuna de su madre, que era cuantiosa, y de cuya mitad había entrado en posesión al cumplir su mayoría de edad. Además, su propio matrimonio, ocurrido poco después, lo hizo más rico aún. Para él, entonces, el legado de la finca Norland no era en verdad tan importante como para sus hermanas; pues ellas, independientemente de lo que pudiera llegarles si su padre heredaba esa propiedad, eran de fortuna que no puede considerarse sino escasa. Su madre no tenía nada, y el padre sólo podía disponer de siete mil libras, porque de la restante mitad de la fortuna de su primera esposa también era beneficiario el hijo, y él sólo tenía derecho al usufructo de ese patrimonio mientras viviera.","From a previous marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had a son; and from his current wife, three daughters. The son, a serious and respectable young man, had his future secured by his mother's fortune, which was considerable, and of which he had come into possession of half upon reaching the age of majority. Moreover, his own marriage, which occurred shortly after, made him even wealthier. For him, then, the inheritance of the Norland estate was not truly as important as it was for his sisters; for they, regardless of what might come to them if their father inherited that property, were of a fortune that can only be considered meager. Their mother had nothing, and the father could only dispose of seven thousand pounds, because the son was also a beneficiary of the remaining half of his first wife's fortune, and he only had the right to the usufruct of that patrimony while he lived.",1551,21.107,2,"Typo in vn, ""Daswood""","Modify 🛠️","Mr Henry Dashvvood'un önceki evliliğinden bir oğlu, şimdiki karısından da üç kızı vardı. Aklı başında, saygın bir delikanlı olan oğlu, annesinin reşit olduğunda yarısı ona kalan büyük servetinden makul bir gelire sahipti. Kısa süre sonra gerçekleşen kendi evliliği de aynı şekilde servetine servet kattı. Dolayısıyla Norland mülkünün sahipliği onun açısından kızkardeşleri için olduğu kadar önemli değildi; çünkü babalarının o mülkü miras almasından onlara düşebilecek payın dışında kızların pek bir çeyizi olamayacaktı. Annelerinin hiçbir şeyi yoktu; babalarının ise elinde topu topu yedi bin poundu vardı, ilk karısının serveti de çocuğuna ipotekli olduğu, ona sadece hayat boyu faiz geliri kaldığı için.","Mr. Henry Dashwood had a son from his previous marriage and three daughters from his current wife. His son, a sensible and respectable young man, had a reasonable income from the large fortune that his mother had left him half of when he came of age. His own marriage, which took place shortly after, also significantly increased his wealth. Therefore, the ownership of the Norland estate was not as crucial to him as it was to his sisters; because aside from the share they might receive from their father's inheritance of that estate, the girls would not have much of a dowry. Their mother had nothing; their father had only seven thousand pounds, as the fortune of his first wife was tied up for her child, leaving him only a lifetime interest income.","2024-09-24T21:23:15.986804Z","Ông Henry Daswood có một con trai trong cuộc hôn nhân thứ nhất và ba con gái trong cuộc hôn nhân thứ hai.

Cũng thế, qua cuộc hôn nhân của mình sau tuổi trưởng thành ít lâu, gia sản anh được tăng thêm. Vì thế, đối với anh việc kế thừa sự sản Norland không thiết yếu như đối với các cô em cùng cha khác mẹ của anh; vì các cô này chỉ kế thừa phần nhỏ nhoi của ông bố. Bà mẹ của họ không có sự sản gì, ông bố chỉ có 7000 bảng; vì lẽ phần còn lại ít ỏi của sự sản bà vợ trước được giành riêng cho con của bà, còn ông chỉ hưởng phần sinh lợi từ khoản tiền này.","Mr. Henry Daswood had one son from his first marriage and three daughters from his second marriage. The young man had a steady temperament and was well-respected, being adequately provided for by his mother's substantial estate, half of which was allocated to him upon reaching adulthood. Likewise, through his marriage shortly after reaching adulthood, his estate was further increased. Therefore, inheriting the Norland estate was not as crucial for him as it was for his half-sisters; for they only inherited a small portion from their father. Their mother had no estate, and their father only had £7000; because the remaining small portion of the first wife's estate was reserved for her son, while he only enjoyed the income generated from this amount."

I am certain that the support he had in mind was only to a certain extent; for example, finding them a small, comfortable house, helping them move, giving them fish you caught or game you hunted, depending on the season. I am sure that the old man had no other intentions; in fact, if he did, it would be strange and unreasonable. ""Dear Mr. Daswood, please consider how comfortably your stepmother and her daughters can live on the interest from £7000, plus £1000 for each daughter, giving each daughter £50, which they would naturally use to pay for their mother's housing. All together, they would have £500 per year; what more could four women want? They would live with very low expenses! House maintenance costs would be negligible. They would not have a carriage, no horses, scarcely any servants, no relatives living with them, and no such expenses at all! Just think about how comfortably they would live! £500 per year! I cannot imagine how they would spend even half of that amount; and then you give them more, it's truly absurd. They have more than enough to give you a portion."""
